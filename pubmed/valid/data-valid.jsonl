world clinical practice . in contrast with the western data in which vte is predominantly a disease of older age , 44% patients in our study were between 40 and 59 years of age while 34% were below 40 years , particularly those with pe . in a study from north india ,\nmen constituted 70% of our registry , more than those reported from vellore registry ( 48% ) , but similar to those reported in the endorse ( epidemiologic international day for the evaluation of patients at risk for vte in the acute hospital care setting ) study ( 69% ) .\none of the reasons for this could be significantly high levels of homocysteine ( thrombophilia marker ) in males as compared to females as reported in an indian study .\nfewer indian women use oral contraceptives and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy , which are known to be risk factors for thrombosis .\nthis is supported by the fact that only 1% of women in this registry reported the use of oral contraceptives , and none reported use of hormonal replacement therapy .\na total of 28% of the overall referrals were from cardiologists . the majority ( 82% ) of the referrals were from medical rather than surgical ( 15% ) specialties as against a referral rate of 93% from surgeons at vellore .\nour finding complements that from the endorse study in which 55% of the medical patients at risk of vte had cardiovascular disease . majority ( 53% ) of patients in our study had co - morbid cardiovascular disease including diabetes mellitus ; it is possible that these patients visited a cardiologist for their cardiovascular ailment ( s ) and were then referred by the cardiologist to vascular disease specialist ( investigator ) .\nmost ( 89% ) of these patients had swelling of the ( lower ) limb .\nit is possible that these patients may not have felt the need to visit a specialist for a symptom like  swelling of limb ,  instead visited their family physician .\nit is very encouraging to know that family physicians suspected dvt in these situations and referred the patient to a specialist .\npatients with a history of vte are about 8 times more likely to develop a new episode during a subsequent high - risk period compared with patients without a history of dvt or pe .\nprior history of dvt was the most ( 34% ) common risk factor in patients who had only dvt , whereas past history of pe , trauma , and immobilization for more than 3 days were the most common risk factors in patients who had only pe .\nour results ( major lower limb surgery as a risk factor in 3% patients ) appear to be consistent with those reported in the endorse study , which reported dvt in 4.4% patients undergoing major lower limb surgery .\nother studies from india have reported a dvt incidence rate ranging from 8% to 20% in major lower limb surgery .\nhowever , in our study , only 7% of patients had malignancy as a predisposing factor . among the malignancies , genitourinary cancer had the highest incidence ( 45% ) .\nhypertension ( 25% ) was the most common co - morbidity followed by diabetes mellitus ( 19% ) in this patient population .\nin addition , obesity ( 11% ) was a common risk factor in dvt complicated by pe .\nour findings support an asian ( korean ) study that demonstrated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 48% patients with vte .\nco - morbid neurological disease ( other than stroke ) and ventilator dependency were also commonly found in patients with dvt ( 10% ) and pe ( 11% ) respectively .\nboth these conditions immobilize patients for prolonged periods of time , predisposing them to vte .\nvenography and pulmonary angiography are the gold standard for diagnosis of dvt and pe respectively . in our study\n, venography was used in just 4% patients and pulmonary angiography in less than one - third of the patients .\nperhaps the relatively high cost of these tests and limited availability of such procedures may be the limiting factors .\noverall , most ( 93% ) patients were managed as inpatients ( 39% diagnosed with vte during hospital stay and 54% admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of vte ) .\na mean duration of hospitalization of 79 days after diagnosis of vte is supported by published data . in selected low - risk patients , outpatient treatment of dvt and pe may be considered .\nthis approach was observed in a small proportion ( 7% ) of patients who were managed on an outpatient basis , nearly all ( 97% ) of whom had only dvt .\nthe reported prevalence of postsurgical vte in our study ( 15% ) was half of that ( 30% ) reported in vellore registry .\nthis could be explained by higher referral rate from surgeons at vellore compared to that of our sites .\nmost ( 40% ; 32/81 ) dvt cases were diagnosed between 2 and 6 postoperative weeks , but pe in most cases ( 70% ; 7/10 ) was diagnosed during the first postoperative week .\nwe notice that acute dvt complicated by pe was less ( 6% ; 7/124 ) frequently diagnosed during the postoperative period as against 18% ( 64/352 ) and 14% ( 10/73 ) of acute dvt alone and pe alone , respectively .\nthe use and duration of anticoagulants in our registry appears to be consistent with the american college of chest physicians treatment guidelines , which recommend at least 5 days of initial anticoagulation with parenteral anticoagulation ( lmwh , fondaparinux , intravenous ufh , or subcutaneous ufh ) and at least 3 months of long - term anticoagulation treatment with vitamin k antagonist .\nbleeding is the most serious complication of anticoagulation treatment and is a major concern for clinicians particularly as the patient 's age advances . in this registry ,\nanticoagulant treatment was needed to be stopped because of bleeding in only 2% of the study population .\nthe prospective reite registry has reported a rate of 3% for major / fatal bleeds .\nthus , the fear of bleeding complications , which decreases the use of anticoagulant treatment , appears to be minimal .\ndvt complicated by pe ( 60% ) and pe alone ( 75% ) were more frequently shifted to intensive care unit than those who had dvt alone ( 25% ) . similar to published data in which hospital readmission rate for vte was 5% for primary and 14% for secondary diagnosis , we report a hospital readmission rate of 6% ; however we do not know the cause for readmission .\nthe death rate was 7% among those diagnosed with vte during hospital stay as against a rate of 1% among those who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of vte .\nover 90% of patients treated on an outpatient basis obtained symptomatic relief with treatment . in our study , the hospital discharge rate ( 97% ) was more than triple and death rate was a quarter of that reported by pandey et al .\n( hospital discharge rate 31% and death rate 16% ) at a university hospital in delhi .\nour data show a significant increase in acute dvt ( pe ) from 2006 to 2010 .\nthis can be explained by the increased awareness of vte in india as well as the advent of better diagnostic modalities , such as duplex ultrasonography becoming more readily available and accepted .\nalthough there was no significant change in the number of pe cases from 2006 to 2010 , the burden of pe is almost double ( 13% of all vte ) of 7% , rate reported at christian medical college , vellore during a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005 .\nour finding is consistent with a study from north india that reported a 16% incidence of pe in adult medical autopsies .\nthis study has the expected limitations of any retrospective review including the availability of complete records for all patients , although a robust review of the data on medical charts was conducted .\ncontrolling for bias and confounders is difficult as there is no randomization and no blinding .\nfollow - up data of patients after hospital discharge were not available . in cases of death ,\nfurther , the clinic charts reviewed in this study included a mix of those from vascular surgery and hematology departments , limiting the generalizability of the study results . despite these limitations ,\nthis study provides large amount of useful information in a short span of time on patient characteristics , clinical outcomes , management strategies , and temporal trends in vte , based on  real world \ndata that reflect actual day - to - day clinical practice over a period of 5 years across three sites in india .\nwe believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment , to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india .\nreal world data reflecting actual day - to - day clinical practice in vte over a period of 5 years across three sites in india showed that vte is not uncommon in indian patients and that acute dvt was responsible for the substantial burden of vte .\nwe believe that this information will serve as a guide in the optimal implementation of vte prophylaxis and treatment , to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the occurrence of vte in india .\nliesel c. dsilva is and dr . sadhna j. joglekar was full -

{"id": 1, "text": "there is an epidemic of stroke in low and middle - income countries due to rapidly increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors such as hypertension , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidaemia .\nthe need has thus arisen to conduct studies aimed at epidemiologic , genetic and phenotypic characterisation of stroke in sub - saharan africa to provide evidence - based information to confront this menace . to this end\n, it is important that controls selected for comparison with cases are recruited with a high degree of certainty that they indeed do not have stroke or tia to allow for valid comparisons to be made . in view of this simple , quick and accurate assessment of symptoms of stroke\nis needed for epidemiologic studies particularly those of the case  control type . in 2000 , meschia et al . developed the questionnaire for verifying stroke - free status ( qvsfs ) as a method for verifying the stroke - free phenotype in participants of clinical , epidemiological and genetic studies .\nhaving one or more affirmative answers to any of the questionnaire was associated with finding stroke , tia , or either stroke or tia on medical record review .\njones et al . showed by directly interviewing participants and review of medical records that the qvsfs had a nppv and ppv of 0.96 and 0.71 respectively making the 8-item qvsfs a sensitive and valid tool , and a structured telephone interview format of questionnaire administration still had an excellent sensitivity of 1.0 , specificity of 0.86 , positive predictive value of 0.36 and negative predictive value of 1.0 among participants aged 60 years and above .\nthe qvsfs is also reliable with intra - rater and inter - rater agreement of stroke - free status classification of 0.90 and 0.94 respectively .\nthe qvsfs is easy to administer as a self - report pencil - and - paper questionnaire or by an interview in person or by telephone and has been translated into spanish by castillo et al . for use among hispanic populations .\ntwo questions in the instrument assess previous diagnosis of either stroke / tia together with six questions about stroke symptoms .\nthus not only is the 8-item qvsfs a useful tool in identifying stroke - free individuals but it could be used to screen for undiagnosed stroke .\nthe sensitivity and specificity of having any of the six symptom questions for stroke detection was 0.82 and 0.62 respectively .\nindeed the qvsfs has been successfully used in the recruitment of controls involved genetic studies into ischaemic stroke , to screen for cerebrovascular end points in the carotid revascularisation endarterectomy versus stent trial ( crest )   and in the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke ( regards ) study .\nthis instrument could have tremendous potential in developing countries where stroke prevalence is increasing , awareness of stroke symptoms low and the confirmation of stroke diagnosis either missed by health workers or constrained by the pervasive lack of neuro - imaging modalities . in these low literacy settings\nthe lack of knowledge of stroke symptoms might impact negatively on the performance of stroke symptom questionnaires .\nfurthermore there is a lack of specific medical terminology for symptoms of stroke in local dialects across sub - saharan africa .\nthe performance of the questionnaire could be enhanced further by the introduction of culturally acceptable pictures of stroke symptoms .\none of the key comments regarding the 8-item qvsfs questionnaire is that the benchmark for verification of strokes has relied on review of medical records of patients but this approach may be problematic in settings where medical records are kept under less than optimal circumstances and where patients may not always seek health services for ailments from medical facilities but from herbalists , chemical shops and so forth .\nan approach to overcome this limitation would be to examine participants by neurologists or to use a cranial ct scan for verification in a subset of participants .\nthis study seeks to validate the 8-item qvsfs at 5 centers in nigeria and ghana which are involved in the on - going nih supported stroke investigative research and educational networks ( siren ) study .\nparticipants will be recruited from five tertiary referral medical centers in west africa namely the komfo anokye teaching hospital ( kath ) in kumasi , ghana ; the university college hospital ( uch ) , ibadan , nigeria ; federal medical centre ( fmc ) , abeokuta , nigeria ; ahmadu bello university hospital ( abuh ) , zaria , nigeria and aminu kano teaching hospital ( akth ) , kano , nigeria ( fig .\nkumasi where kath is situated is the principal city of the akan tribe in central ghana and serves a population of 4 million .\nuch and fmc situated in ibadan and abeokuta respectively are located in southern nigeria and serve a combined population of 4 million nigerians of predominantly yoruba ethnicity .\nabuh and akth in zaria and kano provide health care services to 15 million nigerians of mainly hausa and fulani descent .\nethical approval for the study will be sought from the ethics committees of the 5 participating sites . the original questionnaire developed by meschia et al .  \nwill be translated into the local languages ( yoruba  southern nigeria , hausa  northern nigeria , akan  middle & lower belts of ghana ) , pre - tested and back - translated into english language to establish semantic equivalence . at each of the study sites ,\na panel comprising of a neurologist , three to five doctors and nurses , and public health practitioners will translate the questionnaire into the local dialect by consensus .\nthe translated versions of the questionnaires in 3 languages are shown in supplementary information section ( s1 ) .\nanother version of the questionnaire will be developed where question items 3 to 8 will have line pictures of the neurological symptoms being elicited by the interviewer ( fig .\nparticipants attending general medicine and neurology out - patient clinic appointments will be approached and enrolled into the study after obtaining informed consent .\nbaseline demographic details will be obtained and the questionnaire administered by a medicine resident in the local dialect and the answers recorded as  yes  ,  no  , or  do n't know  to each question item .\nthe version of the questionnaire without pictures will be administered first followed by the version with pictograms by the same interviewer .\nfurthermore , participant awareness of known vascular risk factors such as hypertension , diabetes mellitus , dyslipidaemia , cigarette smoking , excessive alcohol intake , physical inactivity , known heart disorders , family history of stroke will be assessed using 8 questions assessing knowledge of the presence of these specific risk factors . after the interview participants will undergo a 3-staged evaluation by a neurologist .\nthe first stage will involve a review of the medical records of patients to determine if a previous diagnosis of stroke has ever been made , the duration of stroke diagnosis , whether neuro - imaging information on stroke type is available .\nthe second stage entails an examination for presence of hemiparesis , hemi - anesthesia , mono - ocular / binocular visual loss , hemianopsia , receptive or expressive aphasia , and cerebellar deficits .\nthe third stage will comprise of an evaluation of a cranial ct scan in a subset of participants .\nthis neuro - imaging validation will be performed within 48 h among a subset of subjects ( at least 4 stroke and 4 stroke - free ) per site\nafter this thorough evaluation the neurologist makes a diagnosis which is our gold standard . assuming that the standard test has an accuracy of 75% as measured by the area under the roc curve ( auc ) , a sample of 35 cases and 35 controls achieve 82% power to detect an extra accuracy by the proposed test of 15% ( auc = 90% in the proposed test ) using a two - sided test at a significance level of 0.05 . the sample size required increases to 80 per group in order to detect a difference of 10% ( auc = 85% in the proposed test ) under the same conditions .\nthus , the sample size of 100 per linguistic category ( akan , yoruba , hausa ) will be sufficient detect an effect size as small as 10% allowing up to 10% false positive rates and control to case ratio of the standard deviation of the responses to be 0.5 as suggested by obuchowski and mcclish .\ngiven that the 8 items qvsfs is going to be translated into three ( yoruba , hausa , chi ) different languages , we will evaluate the reliability of the translation before it is implemented to predict stroke status using a sample size of 50 consistency and validity of the translation for each language using exploratory factor analysis and cronbach 's alpha .\npatients who score 0/8 will be deemed as stroke free whereas those with any positive score will be deemed as not stroke free according to the 8-item qvsfs .\nsensitivity analysis will be performed where  do n't know  will be assumed to be = 1 .\nbaseline demographic characteristics between patients who are symptom free for stroke and those with stroke will be compared using either chi -

{"id": 2, "text": "\n cardiovascular diseases account for the highest mortality rate worldwide and are expected to be the major cause of death by 2020 ( 1 ) .\nstudies in iran showed that cardiovascular diseases are the most important cause of death and accounted for 42% of all deaths in 2002 ( 2 ) .\ntimely diagnosis and proactive measures play a significant role in effective treatment , prevention development of heart damages and the faster recovery of cardiovascular diseases . the time it takes to reach a hospital or a coronary care unit ( ccu ) and the time spent for diagnostic and treatment measures are factors influencing the delay or loss of time from the outset of severe cardiac infarction to the beginning of treatment ( 3 ) .\noverall , the mortality rate of severe cardiovascular deaths is 30% , more than half of which occurs before hospitalization ( 3 ) . \n \n\nhowever , with the advancement of the epidemic this social trend reverses and people at lower socio - economic classes become more vulnerable ( 3 ) .\nstudies conducted in some developing countries showed that the underprivileged are more susceptible to cardiac arrests compared to affluent people ( 4 ) . furthermore , limited accessibility to health services and the inequality in availability of the services furnished by health and treatment systems deprives these people of acceptable and effective treatment ( 5 ) .\nlimited and unequal accessibility to health services in iran are one of the controversial issues mentioned in several studies ( 5 - 7 ) . \n \n in general , one of the most important goals of a health system is to provide public accessibility and equality in receiving health and treatment services .\nas one measure of development , accessibility to health is one of the basic rights of individuals in the society .\none of the main points in meting out fairness in the health system is that the distribution of health services must not be based on the socio - economic status and incomes of individuals ( 8) . \n \n\ninequality in health services in different countries has taken the form of a global challenge affected by various factors , including individual , social , economic and geographical variables ( 9 ) .\nthese factors are stronger in developing countries ( 8,10 ) so that distribution of health services resources in developing countries has turned into a fundamental issue .\ntherefore , the measurement of fair distribution of health services on top of previous measures has been emphasized by world health organization ( who ) ( 11 ) . \n \n inequality in distribution of health services is measured by different scales one of the most common is the gini coefficient which is based on the lorenz curve ( 12 ) .\nalthough multiple measures of inequality have been shown to be highly correlated with each other ( 7,12 ) , the results of several studies are encouraging and confirming the utility of the gini index in quantifying inequalities in health - related subjects .\nthus , the gini index and lorenz curve are commonly used in analyzing the inequality in distribution of health care resources ( 13 - 16 ) . \n \n\nsince accessibility to intensive healthcare , in particular for cardiovascular conditions , is of utmost importance and since the appropriate distribution of coronary care unit ( ccu ) beds and cardiologists can be taken as a measure , the present study aims to examine the inequality of the geographical distribution of ccu beds and cardiologists in iran using the gini coefficient and the lorenz curve . \n\n\n this study conducted useing demographic data from national census in 2012 collected by the statistics center of iran ( sci ) .\nthe number of ccu beds and cardiologists in public sector by province in 2012 was obtained from iran ministry of health and medical education . \n \n in the present study among various possible inequality measures ( such as gini coefficient , decile ratio , robin hood index and atkinson index ) preference\nwas given to the gini coefficient because it has at least three major advantages ( 17 ) .\nfirst , it is less sensitive to the number of regions and the size of the numerical values in the data material in general .\nthird , gini coefficient can be presented visually by means of a lorenz curve ; which provides an effective visualization of the inequalities . \n \n\nthe lorenz curve compares the distribution of a given variable with the normal distribution ( of same variable ) that represents equality .\nthe grater gap between the lorenz curve and diagonal line means the higher inequality . in this curve\n, the x axis represents the cumulative percentage of population and the y axis shows the percentage of the variable which is expressed as the proportion of the cumulative population .\nthe 45-degree line is called the equality line because of showing the completely equal distribution ( 5 ) . in our study\n, the x axis represents the cumulative percentage of population of iranian provinces and the y axis shows the cumulative frequency of cardiologists and ccu beds in the iranian provinces . \n \n\nthe gini coefficient is defined as the division of the area between diagonal line and the lorenz curve ( 14 ) .\nmathematically speaking , \n \n g1=1k=1n(xkxk1)(yk+yk1 ) \n \n where x represents the cumulative percentage of the population and y represents the cumulative percentage of ccu beds and cardiologists .\nthe gini coefficient ranges between 0 and 1 in which , theoretically , 0 represents complete equality and 1 shows complete inequality of the distribution of a given variable . in practice , however , a coefficient below 0.2 is considered complete equality , one ranging between 0.2 and 0.3 shows high equality , one ranging between 0.3 and 0.4 indicates inequality ; a coefficient varying between 0.4 and 0.6 indicates high inequality and a coefficient larger than 0.6 represents complete inequality ( 14 ) . \n \n\nin this study it is assumed that more cardiologist and ccu beds are associated with more access to cardiovascular health services , so that people in provinces with higher per capital level of cardiologist and ccu beds have more access to cardiovascular health resources / services . \n \n\nfinally , in order to calculate gini coefficient , the demographic data and also the number of ccu beds and cardiologists by province were entered and analyzed through ms excel software . \n\n\n in 2012 , iran had a total population of 75,149,669 with total number of 3665 ccu beds and the total number of 953 cardiologists in public sector .\nthe province of tehran had the largest percentage of ccu beds ( 23.7% ) and cardiologists ( 17% ) .\nthere were respectively 4.8 and 1.3 ccu beds and cardiologists across the nation per 100,000 individuals .\ntable 1 shows the number of cardiologists and ccu beds per 100,000 individuals and the number of cardiologists per 10 ccu beds by province in 2012 . \n \n\nthe lorenz curves for the ccu beds and cardiologists are illustrated in figures 1 and2 .\nthe gini coefficients obtained for ccu beds and cardiologists were 0.129 and 0.045 , respectively . \n\n\n the findings showed that the national mean number of ccu beds for a population of 100,000 is 4.88 , which 23 ( out of a total of 31 ) provinces are below the national mean .\nhowever , the obtained gini coefficients prove statically adequate equality for the geographical distribution of ccu beds across iran .\na previous study showed that the province of yazd enjoys the most equal distribution of ccu beds on one hand , and the province of ilam suffers from the least equal distribution of ccu beds ( 16 ) .\na study on distribution of active hospital bed in iran , reported the gini coefficient for active bed 0.08 and active beds for a population of 10,000 people in 2006 9.2 , while the province of yazd had maximum , and the province of lorestan the minimum beds per population ( 18 ) .\nanother study conducted in 2002 using morris imbalance coefficient , showed the province of yazd stands at the highest rank in terms of the number of hospital beds , and the province of semnan ranks the highest in terms of the number of health centers ( 19 ) . \n \n a study conducted in the  netherlands on the distribution of ccu beds in 24 university hospitals for the period 2004 - 2006 reported gini coefficients of 0.638 , 0.569 and 0.569 , which reflected unequal distribution ( 20 ) . a study conducted at 2006 reflects equal distribution of non - cardiac intensive care beds in iran .\nthe numbers of icu , post icu and nicu beds per 100,000 individuals in iran reported 5.3 , 0.4 and 1.6 , respectively and the gini coefficient for icu , post icu and nicu beds 0.17 , 0.15 and 0.23 ( 14 ) .\nanother study conducted at 2011 showed high degree of inequality in the distribution of kidney transplant beds in iran .\nthe province of tehran had more than half of the beds installed in its hospitals while 17 provinces had no kidney transplant beds at all ( 5 ) . in south africa , there were 4,168 icu beds counted in 2005 of which 86% were installed in three provinces .\nthe proportion of bed varied greatly in different provinces of this country , from 1:20,000 to 1:80,000 ( 21 ) .\nthe distribution of secondary and tertiary health services in the palestine is also reported to be unequal , mostly concentrated in the downtown . in the gaza strip and in the eastern\nstrip the proportions of iu beds per 1,000 were 1.4 and 1.2 , respectively ( 22 ) . in another study in the u.s.a the trend of gini coefficient during 1970 - 1997 was used to measure the distribution of hospital beds .\nthe northern states have been reported to enjoy an equal distribution of hospital beds ( 15 ) . \n \nlorenz curve of ccu beds in 2012 lorenz curve of cardiologists in 2012 \n the present study findings showed that the mean number of cardiologists per 100,000 individuals is 1.27 .\nalso , the mean number of cardiologists per 10 ccu is 2.6 which 13 provinces are below the national mean ( out of a total of 31 provinces ) .\nthe obtained gini coefficient ( 0.045 ) proves statically adequate equality in the geographical distribution of cardiologists across iran .\na study conducted on the distribution of specialist physicians in iran at 2010 showed that the numbers of total specialists per 10,000 individuals and per 10 active beds in the country were 1.7 and 1.9 , respectively and the gini coefficient of distribution of total specialists reported 0.052 ( 18 ) .\nthe gini coefficient was used in a study at 2000 to measure the resource distribution in mental health services in the us , showing the gini coefficient for psychologists as 0.13 ( 15 ) . in another study in japan gini coefficient\nwas used to measure equality in geographical distribution of orthopedic services ; findings showed the orthopedist per 100,000 individuals was 4.3 and the gini coefficient reported 0.36 ( 23 ) . \n \n\nthe low gini coefficients obtained in this study suggest that the health system in iran has been relatively successful in establishing a fair geographical distribution of coronary care services , which can be attributed to the implementation of the fair national health services distribution strategic plan .\niran is the first east mediterranean country to implement this strategic health plan as its fourth development plan and through iran s 20-year vision plan in the health services department ( 24 ) .\nfurthermore , in a 1992 comprehensive program , the health services classification system was developed in order to avoid unnecessary parallel activities , create fairness in the distribution of inpatient health services , make accessible the health services to all people across the country , reduce the number of unused beds and develop a health services classification system on the basis of different specialties and their respective stations by province .\nvariables such as patient admission , population , mean hospital stay length , national divisions , available facilities and the geographical situation ( in terms of route and accessibility ) were determining factors in locating health centers ( 24,25 )\nfor instance , the maximum accessibility time to a ccu bed is set at 30 minutes .\ntherefore , if the temporal distance of a province to the next level of numerical reference shows a time length longer than 30 minutes , the calculated beds , which may even be below the installation basis , would belong to that province and would not be transferred ( 26 ) .\nreports show that in the 2006 - 2007 687 ccu beds were installed in iran , indicating the iranian health system approach to promote health and create the conditions for the fair accessibility of health systems to all citizens ( 27 ) . \n \n\nour study descriptive statistics showed a skewed distribution of ccu beds in iran , so that the capital tehran , accommodating one sixth of the total population of iran , owns one fourth of total ccu beds in iran . in a similar study by ameryoun et al . on the non - cardiac intensive care beds in tehran the ratios of all non - cardiac intensive care beds were almost two times higher than other provinces ( 14 ) . also , in another study by tofighi et al . on the distribution of specialists , tehran owns 23% of all specialists across the country ( 18 ) .\nhowever , a study conducted in 2002 ( 19 ) showed that by morris measure , the health centers in tehran do not constitute a balanced distribution , burdened with problems such as traffic jams and other problems rampant in metropolitan cities , causing delays and waste of time from the beginning of acute myocardial infarction symptoms to the initiation of treatment ( accessibility to the ccu bed ) .\nfurthermore , problems such as overcrowded hospitals in tehran , a drop in quality and quantity of health services , inadequacy of services on one hand and waste of funds for the provinces and finally a drop in public health on the other hand are other problems plaguing megacities .\ntherefore , health policy makers should emphasize decentralization in tehran and identify extra health facilities in different cities so that a balanced allocation of resources may be achieved . \n \n\nfair geographical distribution of health services would lead to efficient and cost - effective health system . while existing classificatory models in iran focus on structural development , the number of beds and a model of providing health services , few studies have concentrated on the distribution by area , classification and defining areas on the basis of optimal distribution of health services ( 26 ) .\ntherefore , current study may provide a foundation for large - scale planning for the health systems in order to remove the inequality in the distribution of health services .\nfurther research and surveys are strongly recommended to acquire more information and monitor the fairness of distribution of different health systems nationally and across provinces . \n \n\nthe aforementioned results represent an initial empirical approximation , the validity of which is limited for the following reasons .\nfirst , counting the number of cardiologists and ccu beds is not an appropriate way to measure extant cardiovascular care and access to it ( a more sufficient reliable measure in iran is not available yet ) .\nsecond , the methodology used to measure inequality is not perfect and biased with limitations in measuring inequality ; for example ,  utilizing the gini coefficient showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran , though , primary information on the distribution of beds and cardiologists showed that about one - fourth of the ccu beds are existed in tehran , where one - sixth of the total population of iran is living  .\nsuch interpretations are helpful for providing an approximation of existing distributions and can show some limitations of using inequality measures . \n \n despite the fact that the present study is one of the few studies conducted on the geographical distribution of one health services ( cardiovascular health services ) in iran , selecting only two factors ( the number of beds and physicians in the distribution of facilities ) and administering only one measure ( the gini coefficient )\nmay be considered as the limitations of this study . also , because of the unavailability of private sector and province - specific data , the research did not consider the private sector capacity and could not produce detailed provincial results , which are hoped to be overcome in future studies . measuring equality in distribution of private sector resources or all the private and public resources together could have extremely different results . \n\n\n using gini measure showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran .\nnevertheless , our descriptive statistics showed that there is a skewness in distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran .\nmoreover , even the equal distribution of cardiovascular health facilities such as ccu beds , does not mean they are sufficiently provided in iran . \n"}

rif , 0.1251 mg / l ; mxf , 0.1250.5 mg / l ; and amk , 0.52 mg / l .\nwe determined the mutation frequencies of the beijing and eai genotype strains by using previously defined critical drug concentrations of 1 mg / l for inh , rif , and mxf and 5 mg / l for amk ( 11,12 ) ( for details , see the technical appendix ) .\nthe mutation frequencies of the beijing and eai genotype strains were similar for inh , mxf , and amk , but they were significantly different for rif ( 1.6  10 to 5.4  10 for beijing strains vs. 6.3  10 to 3.8  10 for eai strains ; p = 0.003 , unpaired mann - whitney test ) ( table 1 ; figure 1 ) . because rifamycin drugs are widely used to treat tb , the difference in the mutation frequencies of beijing and eai genotype strains for rif is a major finding .\nfrequency of rifampin ( rif)-resistant mutants in mycobacterium tuberculosis beijing and east - african / indian ( eai ) genotype strains ( 5 strains each ) originating from vietnam .\nstatistical analysis was performed by using an unpaired mann - whitney test . for beijing genotype strains ,\nthe increase in mutation frequency during exposure to rif could be due to described missense mutations in the mut genes ( 13 ) .\nsuch mutations in the mut genes can change the dna repair mechanism ; as a consequence , the frequency of resistant mutant formation might increase . however , a direct correlation between the occurrence of particular mutations in mut genes and altered mutation frequency has not been proven .\nfurthermore , werngren and hoffner ( 14 ) found an equal mutation frequency for beijing ( 3.6  10 ) and non - beijing ( 4.4  10 ) genotypes . a possible explanation for the discrepancy in findings might be the concentration of rif used in the subculture plates . in our study ,\nthe critical concentration of 1 mg / l rif was used ( 11 ) , whereas werngren and hoffner used a concentration of 2 mg / l rif .\nin addition , werngren and hoffner compared the beijing and non - beijing genotypes of several genotype families , whereas we compared beijing and eai genotype strains that were selected from the same tuberculosis - endemic area and during the same period .\nwe determined the time - kill kinetics of rif toward 2 strains with significantly different mutation frequencies : beijing-1585 ( 3.7  10 [ 3.0  10 and 4.3  10 , duplicates ] ) and eai-1627 ( 3.5  10 [ 2.8  10 and 4.1  10 , duplicates ] ) .\ncultures with low and high densities of beijing-1585 and eai-1627 were investigated as described ( 15 ) .\nrif showed strong time- and concentration - dependent activity toward low - density cultures of the 2 strains ( figure 2 ) .\nlow concentrations of rif were needed to achieve > 99% mycobacterial killing ; differences between beijing-1585 and eai-1627 were minor ( table 2 ) .\nhowever , to achieve 100% killing , especially for beijing-1585 , rif concentrations had to be increased substantially ( table 2 ) .\ncompared with the low - density culture for beijing-1585 , a substantial increase in rif concentrations was needed to achieve 100% killing of the high - density culture ( table 2 ) .\nthis finding may be relevant in the clinical context because high - density mycobacteria populations are expected to exist in infected tissues of tb patients .\nconcentration- and time - dependent bactericidal effect of rifampin ( rif ) toward low - density cultures of mycobacterium tuberculosis be-1585 ( 5.1  10 cfu / ml ) ( a ) and m. tuberculosis eai-1627 ( 6.8  10 cfu / ml ) ( b ) .\nafter 1 , 3 , or 6 days of exposure , subcultures were performed on solid media to count cfus . *\naccurate cfu counting could not be performed  because complete outgrowth of mycobacteria occurred on the sixth day of rif exposure , leading to aggregation .\n* cultures were exposed to rif at 2-fold increasing concentrations for 6 days at 37c ;

shock pacing therapy , but no long - term bradycardia pacing .\nalthough it has been shown as an alternative to the standard transvenous icd , its compatibility with mri remains unclear .\nvarious types of clinical mri systems currently use a superconductive magnet that creates a static magnetic field strength , typically 1.5 or 3 t. the use of mri with most pacemakers and icds is considered a contraindication due to potential hazards , including heating of the electrode that resides in or on the heart , damage to myocardium , elevation of pacing thresholds , unintended induction of ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) or ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) , pacing inhibition , permanent device malfunction , and distortion of the mri scan . recently ,\nmr - conditional. mr - conditional indicates a lack of known hazards in a specified mri environment with specified conditions of use . due to the variety of mri scanners and scanning protocols , it is not practical to test even a single device under all conditions . hence , mr - conditional labelling dictates that the device is safe for use under certain scanning conditions , as well as how the cardiac device should be programmed before an exposure to the magnetic field in a mri scanner . the literature ,\nalthough limited , provides some guidance for imaging patients with implanted pacemakers or icds that do not have mr - conditional labelling .\nthis single - centre prospective non - controlled study describes the first use of mri in patients with an implanted s - icd .\npatients with implanted s - icd systems ( boston scientific sqrx model 1010 and q -

up 10 days after the scan . to ascertain the effect of heating due to the instrumented thermistor catheter , the two patients who experienced the heating ( examinations 9 and 16 , see table  2 ) were rescanned several weeks later without the thermistor catheter in place ( examinations 11 and 17 ) .\nfirst , modified sequence ( with even lower amount of energy deposited in the tissue ) was used , which caused no heating . as no sensation was reported by the subjects , they were asked to report even a minimal discomfort , and the lumbar scans were performed using the same settings that resulted in heating with the thermistor catheter in place in the first imaging session .\nthe results of the rescans revealed that no heating was felt by the patients when the thermistor catheter was absent .\nthere were no noted changes to battery voltage , ability to detect the qrs signal or stored diagnostic data .\npacing thresholds can not be assessed by the s -

conditional pacemakers from several companies , but very limited reports about mr - conditional icds .\nbiotronik announced in late 2011 release of their first mr - compatible icd device and defibrillator leads pro mri , but in the conditions of use excluded scanning of the torso and focused more on the extremities examination . in european heart rhythm association survey\n, 60% of centres did not implant any mri - certified icds , 34.3% implanted < 10 icd devices , and only 5.6% implanted 10 and more icds ; one - fifth of responders stated that mri - certified icds should be implanted in all patients but lack of reimbursement was indicated as a possible obstacle to implant more mri - certified pacemakers / icds by 47.1% of responding centres .\nnone of the components of the s - icd system are on or in the heart\n. the s - icd depends less upon being in direct contact with the myocardium to function and instead uses far - field sensing and stimulation to provide the shock and post - shock pacing therapy . as a consequence , unlike transvenous systems heating near or around the electrode can not harm the myocardium , which could present with possible safety consequences such as an elevation in pacing thresholds or scarring of the myocardium , but it may still cause serious patient discomfort . because the s - icd is larger than modern transvenous icd 's , there may be more potential for the can to experience heating due to the magnetic gradient or rf field .\nwe report results from what we believe is the first experience of mri scanning in patients with an implanted s - icd and in various anatomical areas .\noverall , mri was performed safely in all patients , which is in contrast to the current literature with mri imaging in patients with electrical - active devices which are not mri - conditional . in our study , the primary clinically significant event attributable to the mri scan was the occurrence of heating in the area of the pocket in the four patients that underwent lumbar scans .\nit was not known if this was due to the s - icd can itself or an artefact of the thermistor catheter used to measure skin temperature over the pocket .\nthis required a revision of our protocol , which was to re - scan two of the patients who complained of heating .\nre - scanning of these patients without the thermistor probe resulted in no complaints of heating , so it is assumed that the thermistor catheter itself heated during the lumbar scans and caused the discomfort .\nas further evidence , all the heating complaints occurred during rf - intensive scan sequences ( namely fast spin echo ) with the temperature probe located axially near the centre of the bore , where rf fields are the highest .\nthe thermistor catheter is constructed of insulated conductive cables connected to electrodes and should couple to the rf fields efficiently , causing heating at the electrodes and pain or damage on the surface of the skin where the probe was placed over the s - icd can .\nif the heating was due to the s - icd can itself , it would more likely occur during gradient - intensive scan sequences ( which can generate eddy currents on can surfaces and internal components ) and at locations in the bore where there are high gradient fields , such as near the bore edges .\nhowever , when the patient was scanned with gradient - intensive scan sequences ( e.g. flair dwi ) and with the s - icd system in high gradient field locations in the bore ( e.g. such as during a brain scan ) , patients did not detect any heating or discomfort .\nin addition , the subcutaneous lead , which was not instrumented with a thermistor catheter , never resulted in any heating sensation noted by the patient , even when exactly the same sequence that resulted in heating in the first session was used\n. the use of mri - compatible temperature monitors such as fibre optic temperature probes would have provided better confirmation of possible skin temperature elevation and would not have been affected by the rf fields . for cardiac imaging ,\nthe main problem to solve is metallic artefact , especially on the gradient - echo sequences . like in research performed by nazarian et al .\n, several scan protocols were used to see if any yielded different effects or reduced the qualitative extent of artefact .\ngradient mode was changed from normal to whisper , resulting in slower ramping of the field and therefore diminishing the changes of the magnetic field in time .\nartefacts when present were limited to blurring of the left ventricle during cardiac scans and most yielded clinically useful information .\nstandard interrogation of the s - icd revealed no adverse effects upon the functioning of the system . while no adverse effects upon the post - scan s - icd device function were noted , not all possible scanning protocols were tested .\nit should be noted that , four of the s - icd 's were exposed to repeat mri scans without adverse effects to device function . in addition , because the s - icd does not provide long - term bradycardia pacing , it is assumed that pacemaker - dependent patients would not be implanted with this system .\nthe inhibition of the pacemaker function during the scanning sequence and possible pacing threshold changes are a unique concern in patients implanted with transvenous icds .\nthis study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 t mri scanner .\nthus , even these preliminary results should only be applied to 1.5 t mri scanners ( similarly as reported in the present literature for other implantable devices ) .\ndevice functionality was tested immediately after the scan but not for long - term effects .\nin addition , not all device functions were tested although the s - icd system does have a beeper / interrogation warning if battery levels or memory irregularities occur .\nhowever , patients were scheduled for regular check - up and no defect of the device was observed in following 725 months ( mean observation time 18 months ) . delayed enhancement mri for determining cardiac scarring was also not tested .\nalso , there are other anatomical areas that were not evaluated , such as shoulder and knees .\nthis study included only 15 patients and 22 scans done on the same 1.5 t mri scanner .\nthus , even these preliminary results should only be applied to 1.5 t mri scanners ( similarly as reported in the present literature for other implantable devices ) .\ndevice functionality was tested immediately after the scan but not for long -

conditional , this study is the study to demonstrate the feasibility of exposing s - icd patients to mri using the scanning and monitor protocol described , with some precautionary measures including : ( i ) programming the device therapy off ; ( ii ) limiting the sar to 2.0 w / kg ; ( iii ) continuous monitoring of the patients pulse oximetry and ecg by qualified personnel and especially for any feelings of heating ; ( iv ) evaluate device function post scan ; ( v ) availability of full resuscitation facilities at the mri site .\ngiven the variables of different mri scanners , the decision to perform mri on patients with an implanted s - icd system should be balanced against the potential risks . in our study ,\nthe only heating was very likely introduced by not fully mri - compatible thermometer probe ; subjects rescanned without the probe did not report any abnormalities during the scan of any body area listed ( brain , cervical and lumbar spine , heart , and knee ) .\nthis study was supported by iga mz r nt12094/2011 , research project charles university in prague , prvouk p34 and unce 204010/2012 .\nfunding to pay the open access publication charges for this article was provided by iga mz r nt12094/2011 ."}

oxidative stress and regenerates active forms of the antioxidant vitamin e .\ndeficiency of coenzyme q10 affects oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) production , and consequently impairs muscle energy metabolism .\ntherefore , a deficiency of coenzyme q10 is the most probable mechanism of statin - related myopathy [ 79 ] .\nif the proposed mechanism of statin

study ( intragroup comparison ) ( table 2 ) .\nin the present study , the possible beneficial effects of coenzyme q10 supplementation on mild - to - moderate statin - related muscle symptoms were studied , since this is one of the most frequent reasons for statin therapy withdrawal .\nwe found that supplementation with coenzyme q10 ( 50 mg twice daily for 30 days ) reduced muscle pain and produced less interference by pain with daily life activities .\noverall , coenzyme q10 supplementation decreased statin - related muscle symptoms in 75% of patients .\nwe observed no significant effects of coenzyme q10 supplementation on liver and muscle enzymes , which were within normal ranges during the course of the study in both treatment groups . also , cholesterol levels did not change significantly from the beginning to the end of the study .\nthe observed beneficial effects of coenzyme q10 supplementation could lead to better statin treatment compliance .\nthe present study was designed as a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled trial to evaluate the possible beneficial effect of coenzyme q10 supplementation ( 50 mg twice daily for 30 days ) on statin - associated muscle pain .\na 30-day period was chosen because data in the literature indicate that the effect should reveal itself within that period . in its absence ,\nextended supplementation is not recommended . using the standardized and simple brief pain inventory ( bpi ) questionnaire , consisting of a pain severity score ( pss ) and a pain interference score ( pis )\n, we found that after 30 days with coenzyme q10 supplementation , muscle pain and the interference of pain with daily life activities in the mild - to - moderate symptom group were significantly reduced from the beginning to the end of the study ( from 3.90.4 to 2.90.4 and from 4.00.4 to 2.60.4 , respectively , both p<0.001 ) .\nthe relative values of pss and pis significantly decreased in the q10 group compared to placebo group ( 33.1 and 40.3% , respectively ; both p<0.05 ) , showing the effectiveness of q10 .\ncoenzyme q10 supplementation did not affect liver and muscle enzymes , which were in the normal ranges in both groups during the course of the study . according to the guidelines , all patients included in our study had myalgia \nmuscle pain per se that could also be accompanied with other muscular symptoms such as muscle weakness , muscle fatigue , or both .\nthe levels of all cholesterols did not differ significantly before and after intervention in separate groups .\nconflicting results of coenzyme q10 supplementation on statin - induced muscle pain were observed in previous studies .\nthe beneficial effects of coenzyme q10 were confirmed in 2 studies , but not in others .\nreported that coenzyme q10 supplementation at a 200-mg daily dose ( twice that used in our study ) for 12 weeks did not improve myalgia in patients receiving simvastatin ( in a dosage of 1040 mg daily ) . in that study ,\nthe myalgia score was assessed by a visual analogue scale , which is known to be less accurate than the more complex brief pain inventory ( bpi ) questionnaire used in our study , and this could be the reason for the negative result observed .\nsimilar results were observed in a study by bookstaver et al . , in which coenzyme q10 was supplemented in a dosage of 120 mg daily for 3 months .\nit is also interesting that the intervals of observation were longer in both of these 2 studies compared to the present study . on the other hand ,\nthe most similar regimen to ours was in the study by caso et al . ,\nin which the same dosage of coenzyme q10 was prescribed ( 100 mg daily ) and the bpi questionnaire was used to assess pain severity and pain interference with daily activities .\nalso , the duration of supplementation was the same . like our results , a decrease in both parameters was observed after 30 days of coenzyme q10 supplementation , but its major limitation was not being placebo - controlled . from that point of view , the results obtained in the present study have greater value and confirm the beneficial effect of coenzyme q10 supplementation . a recent study by fedacko et al\n. showed that coenzyme q10 supplementation decreased symptoms of statin - associated myopathy , intensity of muscle pain , muscle weakness , muscle cramps , and muscle tiredness . considering all data from the above - mentioned studies together , we believe that the conflicting results show a complex relation between statin - related muscle symptoms and coenzyme q10 supplementation , probably due to the many confounding factors that influence the efficacy of coenzyme q10 supplementation .\nthe limitation of the present study was the relatively small number of patients involved , which consequently limits extensive generalization of the results obtained .\nthe main reason for the relatively small population group lay in the strict inclusion criteria , which ensured recruiting only patients with  real  statin - related muscular symptoms , who were highly motivated and informed , and consequently an accurate estimate of the intervention efficacy could be obtained .\nspecifically , over - subjective estimation of statin - associated muscular symptoms is a well - known problem , which could importantly affect the results and conclusions .\nundoubtedly , further studies enrolling larger numbers of participants are warranted to address this problem .\nimportantly , patients with mild - to - moderate muscular symptoms were included , which is probably the most frequent clinical scenario in patients with statin - related symptoms .\nfurthermore , it is important to note that it was placebo - controlled and used widely accessible , relatively objective standardized questionnaires , allowing for great comparability . on the other hand\n, we do not know whether the proposed therapy is effective in all patients with statin - associated symptoms , but according to our data , it should be effective in the mild - to - moderate statin - associated symptoms group .\nthe present study was patient - oriented and designed to focus on clinical effects of coenzyme q10 supplementation in statin - induced muscle symptoms , and not its mechanistic background .\ntherefore , the concentration of coenzyme q10 in plasma or muscles and possible mechanistic background ( e.g. , anti - inflammatory and anti - oxidative ) were not addressed in this study .\nthe present study revealed that by simple coenzyme q10 supplementation of the regular statin treatment , associated muscle pain in the mild - to - moderate symptoms group could be significantly reduced .\nconsequently , it may lead to lower interference with daily activities and higher compliance with statin treatment .\nthese observations mean a better quality of life , besides adequate cardiovascular protection , which is the primary goal of statin therapy .\nthe results of the present study are very promising , but require further testing in larger clinical trials , mainly to allow them to be generalized ."}

insulin dependency at diagnosis ( 4 ) .\nage , bmi , duration of diabetes and of insulin independency , which of the antibodies that were analysed , gadab titres and the expression of the essential outcome variable c - peptide vary ( 2 , 4 , 5 , 2830 ) .\na cochrane review also noted the heterogeneity between studies , and the conclusion about early insulin treatment was uncertain ( 5 ) .\nour study included patients aged 30 years , non - insulin dependent at the times of diagnosis and inclusion and positive to at least one pancreatic autoantibody , for 75% two antibodies , thereby fulfilling the main criteria for lada ( 4 ) .\nthe results of the study indicated that none of the baseline parameters , except initial c - peptide level , significantly influenced the outcome , eliminating the importance of several criteria in comparisons with other studies .\nin other studies , patients aged > 65 years have often been excluded , but lada exists also in these older age groups ( 11 ) . the decline in residual -cell function was progressive for the majority of our lada patients , as is usual in autoimmune diabetes ( 4 , 8 , 13 , 16 ) .\nwe observed great variation in the rates and magnitudes of -cell loss between patients and between different time periods during the study , with no consistent patterns .\nmechanisms such as more step - wise losses due to , for instance , partial remissions might explain this ( 15 ) . the decline in c - peptide was irrespective of age , gender , bmi , antibody titres , hbalc or treatment modality .\nthe lack of influence of bmi , age , diabetes duration and baseline hbalc on disease progression was also seen in a non - interventional observation study of lada that followed 13 ab - positive patients by stimulated c - peptide for 2 years ( 16 ) .\nsimilar to ukpds , we found no association between gadab levels and disease progress ( 31 ) , in contrast to observational studies that described this ( 30 , 32 ) .\nwe could not , in a number of regression analyses , define any other factor besides cp0 that significantly influenced the level of cp36 .\nthe significance of initial c - peptide level was also demonstrated in a large swedish study of new - onset 1534 year olds and in the tokyo intervention study ( 28 , 33 ) .\nthe length of our study may explain that some patients with initially higher levels of c - peptide , overrepresented in the control group , by 36 months had not yet lost enough -cell function to be clinically insulin dependent .\nsome antibody - positive patients were described to take up to 12 years to become insulin dependent , but practically all eventually did ( 34 )\n. a significant beneficial effect of early insulin treatment on the preservation of -cell function could not be demonstrated , but level of hbalc after 36 months was better preserved in the insulin treated , in keeping with observations by chaillous et al .\nincidentally , the shape of the curve of the development of hbalc levels over time for the conventionally treated group in our study had a likeness to that observed in the ukpds ( 35 ) . our study , as most prospective intervention studies of lada , was not large .\nthe tokyo study , with 60 patients , found a preference for insulin treatment versus su , possibly due to the differences in treatment , but longer duration of diabetes , up to 5 years without insulin before inclusion , rendering a selection of patients with better endogenous insulin production from the start , would have excluded those who progressed earlier to insulin dependence , so the trial population differed from ours ( 28 ) .\nbaseline level of c - peptide was an important independent predictor of the ability to preserve a sufficient amount of c - peptide over time , just as in our study .\nmany reports end with a general recommendation of insulin treatment in lada , but the evidence has not been compelling , as concluded by the 2007 cochrane review , which scrutinised seven insulin intervention studies in lada , two insulin versus su , the rest insulin alone versus different combinations of insulin+oha ( 5 ) .\nukpds recorded hbalc , weight and treatment , randomised to insulin versus su , and found that 60% of the su treated were insulin dependent after 2 years ( 36 ) .\none conclusion was that su might promote insulin dependency and apart from not recommending su the cochrane review found no preference for any special type of treatment for the lada group ( 5 ) . in our study after 3 years , 65% of the conventionally treated patients were not yet treated with insulin .\nin contrast to both ukpds and the tokyo study , only 30% of our control patients were treated with su , which could be of importance for -cell function . in another study , of 54 patients in four groups ,\nthe insulin treated , all with low fcp , 0.3  nmol , received either insulin alone or combined with rosiglitazone ( rgz ) , and the oha treated , all with fcp > 0.3 \nto our knowledge , this study is the first prospective controlled european intervention study of treatment in lada .\ndifferences in defining the lada population regarding age , diabetes duration before start of intervention , antibody prevalences and gadab titres , bmi and , not least , baseline levels of c - peptide , if available , have contributed to difficulties in interpreting and comparing the results of the few existing lada intervention studies ( 4 , 5 , 28 , 29 , 37 ) . in this study ,\nnone of these factors , except baseline level of c - peptide , significantly affected the outcome .\nthe similar findings also seen in trials of classical type 1 diabetes and of prevention of autoimmune diabetes in high - risk individuals substantiate the observation of the influence of initial level of c - peptide on outcome level ( 38 , 39 ) .\nwe also saw a non - significant or favouring insulin treatment for preservation of -cell function , indicating the possibility that a larger study population and/or a longer period of follow - up might demonstrate significant preference for early insulin treatment also regarding -cell function .\nthis study indicated that early insulin treatment in lada patients lead to better preservation of level of metabolic control , and that it was safe and well tolerated .\nthe decline in c - peptide was progressive irrespective of age , gender , bmi , hbalc levels and antibody titres\n. only baseline level of c - peptide significantly influenced c - peptide level after 3 years .\nm landin -

{"id": 7, "text": "anemia is a global health problem   and an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in various groups of patients , especially in patients with chronic diseases and in the elderly .\nlow levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin d ( 25ohd ) are also highly prevalent among these patients .\nrecent epidemiological evidence suggests that circulating 25ohd is inversely associated with hemoglobin ( hb ) levels [ 415 ] .\nthe risk of anemia is highest at deficient 25ohd levels ( i.e. , < 30  nmol / l ) and lowest at 25ohd levels of 50 to 125  nmol / l [ 4 , 6 , 15 ] . in chronic kidney disease ( ckd )\npatients , some nonrandomized intervention studies could already show that intravenous administration of activated vitamin d ( 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 = 1,25(oh)2d3 ) is associated with an increase in hb levels within 12 months of treatment and a reduced need for erythropoietin ( epo ) [ 16 , 17 ] .\nmoreover , intravenous 1,25(oh)2d3 administration was associated with a decreased weekly epo dose of 50% . regarding hb levels ,\nsimilar results have been obtained in hemodialysis patients with oral alfacalcidol ( 1-vitamin d3 ) after 8 weeks   and also after 12 and 18 months of treatment . in hemodialysis patients , high - dose oral vitamin d2 ( 50,000  iu monthly ) was associated with dose - reductions in erythropoiesis - stimulating agents ( esa ) , while hb concentrations remained unchanged [ 21 , 22 ] . in children with ckd stage 5 and 25ohd levels\n< 75  nmol / l , 12 weeks of vitamin d2 treatment in conjunction with 1,25(oh)2d3 was associated with a significantly reduced dose of esa required to treat the children . in anemic patients with preserved kidney function , however , one single intramuscular bolus of 600,000  iu vitamin d3 did not influence hb levels . nevertheless , it is noteworthy that in general populations the effect of high - dose bolus administration of vitamin d on clinical outcomes has been questioned .\nthe purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of a daily vitamin d3 supplement on hb levels in a group of hypertensive patients with preserved kidney function and inadequate 25ohd levels .\nthis is a secondary analysis of the styrian vitamin d hypertension trial of a postspecified endpoint .\nthe study was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , single - center trial which took place at the outpatient clinic at the division of endocrinology and metabolism , medical university of graz , austria .\nthe study was registered at eudract ( number 2009 - 018125 - 70 ) and clinicaltrials.gov ( nct02136771 ) .\nthe study was approved by the ethics committee of the medical university of graz , austria .\ntwo hundred study participants ( 106 men and 94 women ) were recruited from the clinics of the department of cardiology and the department of internal medicine , division of endocrinology and metabolism , medical university of graz , austria , from june 2011 to august 2014 .\neligible study participants were adults aged 18 years or older with a serum 25ohd concentration below 75  nmol / l and arterial hypertension .\npregnant or lactating women were excluded as well as patients with hypercalcemia ( serum calcium > 2.65 \nmmol / l ) , regular vitamin d intake > 880  iu per day during the last four weeks before the study , estimated glomerular filtration rate ( egfr ) < 15  ml / min per 1.73  m , drug intake as part of another clinical study , acute coronary syndrome or cerebrovascular event in the previous two weeks , 24-hour systolic bp > 160  mm  hg or < 120  mm  hg , 24-hour diastolic bp > 100  mm  hg , change in hypertensive treatment ( drugs or lifestyle ) in the previous four weeks or planned changes in antihypertensive treatment during the study , any disease with an estimated life expectancy of < 1 year , any clinically significant acute disease requiring drug treatment , and chemotherapy or radiation therapy .\neligible study participants were randomly allocated to receive 2800  iu ( 70  g ) cholecalciferol as seven oily drops per day ( oleovit d3 , fresenius kabi austria , graz , austria ) or a matching placebo for eight weeks .\nthe dose of 2,800  iu vitamin d per day was chosen because a rule of thumb suggests that vitamin d supplementation of 1,000  iu increases 25ohd levels by approximately 25  nmol / l .\ngiven that a commonly used normal range of 25ohd is 75 to 150  nmol / l   we conclude that a supplementation of 2,800  iu daily may be sufficient to increase the 25ohd level of most study participants to target ranges without causing supraphysiological 25ohd levels .\none hundred patients were assigned to the intervention group and 100 patients to the control group .\nrandomization was performed by web - based software ( http://www.randomizer.at/ ) with a permuted block randomization ( block size of 10 and stratification according to sex ) .\nthe primary outcome measures were hb levels and anemia . in accordance with earlier classifications [ 4 , 6 , 29 ] , hb concentrations <\n12.5  g / dl were considered as anemic , which corresponded to the average threshold value of the world health organization gender - based definition ( < 13.0  g / dl in men and < 12.0  g / dl in women ) .\nblood sampling was performed in the morning between 7 and 11 am after an overnight fast .\nall blood samples were either measured at least four hours after blood collection or immediately stored at 20c until analysis .\nmeasurement of 25ohd was performed by chemiluminescence assay ( ids - isys 25-hydroxyvitamin d assay ; immunodiagnostic systems ltd . , boldon , uk ) on an ids - isys multidiscipline automated analyzer .\nall hematological parameters were measured on a sysmex xe-5000 automated hematology analyzer ( sysmex america , inc . ,\nthe measurements of other biochemical parameters have been described elsewhere . in accordance with published data\n[ 31 , 32 ] we categorized 25ohd levels < 30  nmol / l as deficient , 3049.9  nmol / l as insufficient , and 50 to 74.9  nmol / l as borderline .\nchange from baseline data is shown as means and 95% confidence interval ( ci ) .\nwe used the mcnemar test and fisher 's exact test , respectively , to assess differences in anemic status within and between groups . the unpaired t -

study 25ohd levels on average clearly above 75 \nthis value is recommended by many endocrinologists and vitamin d researchers as the lower target level for various clinical outcomes [ 33 , 34 ] .\nsecond , the study duration of 8 weeks was relatively short , given that the half - life of red blood cells in circulation is 3 months .\nthird , we have no data on circulating levels of 1,25(oh)2d , which is the active , hormonal form of vitamin d. generally , evidence is increasing that 1,25(oh)2d can stimulate erythropoiesis in red blood cell precursor cells by increasing epo sensitivity .\nfurthermore , 1,25(oh)2d can upregulate proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells [ 35 , 36 ] .\nnevertheless , our findings with plain vitamin d in patients with preserved kidney function do not support the beneficial impact on hb levels of earlier studies with activated vitamin d in ckd patients [ 16 , 17 ] .\nit is , however , noteworthy that in ckd patients the prevalence of anemia is high and circulating 1,25(oh)2d levels are low .\nmoreover , a recent meta - analysis of randomized controlled trials has demonstrated that , after administration of vitamin d or activated vitamin d , the increase in circulating 1,25(oh)2d tends to be much higher in ckd patients than in non - ckd patients . in our study , a vitamin d - induced increase in circulating 1,25(oh)2d levels may have been blunted by the suppressed pth levels , and this may have contributed , at least in part , to the null effect on hb levels . in the present study ,\nmoreover , it was a surprising finding that all 13 anemic patients had initial 25ohd levels > 50  nmol / l . generally , epidemiological evidence suggests that circulating 25ohd levels are inversely associated with hb levels and anemia risk [ 4 , 6 ] .\na recent meta - analysis of retrospective observational studies showed that , compared with individuals with adequate 25ohd levels , low 25ohd levels were associated with an odds ratio for anemia of 2.25 ( 95% ci : 1.473.44 ) . the cut - off for low 25ohd levels was 50 \nnmol / l in 5 out of the 7 included studies and 75  nmol / l in the remaining 2 studies . only individuals without chronic diseases were included in that meta - analysis .\nhowever , two large studies in patients with cardiovascular disease [ 4 , 6 ] indicate that hb levels are only significantly affected if circulating 25ohd levels are in the deficiency range . also of note\nis the fact that observational studies have shown circulating 1,25(oh)2d to be a better predictor of anemia than circulating 25ohd [ 4 , 5 , 39 ] .\naltogether , data indicate that especially anemic patients with deficient 25ohd levels and low circulating 1,25(oh)2d levels may benefit from improved vitamin d status .\nin conclusion , our data demonstrate that a daily vitamin d supplement of 2800  iu for 8 weeks does not increase hb levels in nonanemic hypertensive patients with 25ohd levels"}

to - mouse passage , \n requiring both careful monitoring of the tumor burden and labor intensive \n animal transfers . through serial passaging \n in mice and the absence of any in vitro manipulation ,\npdx tumors remain \n biologically stable , preserving much of the molecular , genetic , and \n histological features as well as heterogeneity of the original tumor .\nhowever , given the high costs of animal maintenance , \n lengthy latency period following engraftment , variable engraftment \n rates , and rare access to patient tissue specimens , pdx in vivo models \n are generally not yet widely employed in cancer research .\nmost notably , given the poor viability exhibited \n when grown in vitro under standard tissue culture conditions , it is \n extremely challenging to culture pdx bone metastatic pca cells for \n any brief ex vivo manipulation needed to conduct controlled mechanistic \n studies in vivo .\nmirroring the in vitro behavior of pdx prostate \n tumors , pca cell \n lines belonging to the lncap series also adhere poorly to two - dimensional \n ( 2d ) tissue culture surfaces , precluding them from use in standard \n drug screening platforms . to circumvent \n this problem ,\nour laboratory recently demonstrated the feasibility \n of using three - dimensional ( 3d ) hyaluronan ( ha)-based hydrogel systems \n to support the growth and viability of these pca cell lines for mechanistic \n studies and drug testing . while the commonly employed human \n tumor spheroid model is an alternative to culturing these poorly adherent \n cells , hydrogel encapsulation provides the means to fully recapitulate \n the tumor microenvironment with precise , tunable control over architectural \n and mechanical cues and/or critical cell \nspecifically , as a ubiquitous component of the bone marrow \n where bone metastatic pca cells reside , ha plays an active role in \n regulating several biological processes , including tumorigenesis , \n strongly justifying its use as an extracellular matrix analogue for \n culturing bone metastatic tumor cells in vitro . on the basis of the suitability of ha -

autoclaved before each use and were \n sealed onto sterile glass slides before being employed as molds for \n hydrogel fabrication .\neach cylindrical cavity could hold approximately \n 50 l of hydrogel . prior to pdx tumor culture\n, ha -

sh and peg - da ( 4:1 \n v / v ) as described above , and 25 l of the cell - hydrogel suspension \n was immediately pipetted into each mold cavity , over the 35 l \n cushion layer of cross - linked ha -

derived cells that die immediately \n within the hydrogels . as the presence of high numbers of dead cells \n would complicate any biochemical assays that were envisioned , we sought \n to develop an alternative procedure designed to encapsulate cells \n with high viability ( figure 1a ) .\n( a ) mda pca \n 183 and mda pca 118b pdx tumors ( indicated by red arrows ) that were \n grown subcutaneously in scid mice were harvested , then mechanically \n and enzymatically digested .\nthe tumor slurry was subsequently plated \n onto 6-well plates and cultured for 2 days during which the majority \n of mouse - derived cells ( red ) attached .\nthe resulting tumor aggregates \n that formed ( blue ) then were encapsulated within ha - sh / peg - da hydrogels \n and cultured for up to 14 days .\n( b ) dissociated tumor cells plated on tissue culture plastic \n for 2 days formed multicellular clusters in suspension with other \n cell types adhering to the plastic surface .\n( c ) mixture of dapi - stained \n ( blue ) cells within tumoroids and adherent cells after 2 days in culture . \n\nscale bars = 100 \n m . in optimizing the culture conditions \n for the pdx pca cells\n, we \n observed that most of the mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b pca cells that \n had undergone mechanical and enzymatic digestion and been plated onto \n 6-well plates formed multicellular aggregates in suspension after \n 2 days in culture , presumably reflecting their characteristic poor \n adherence onto tissue culture plastic ( figure 1b ) .\nadditionally , during this period , we noted that a population \n of cells in the tumor slurry ( shown in red in figure 1a ) adhered to the tissue culture plastic surface .\nleveraging \n this phenomenon , we collected the aggregates in suspension ( leaving \n behind the adherent cells ) and found that the process of gentle centrifugation \n resulted in the removal of dead cells . given that the mda pca 183 \n and mda pca 118b tumors were grown as subcutaneous tumors in mice , \n they carry along with them a subpopulation of mouse - derived cells \n in addition to the human pca cells .\nindeed , we found that among the \n poorly adherent pca cells that formed multicellular aggregates in \n suspension after 2 days on tissue culture plastic , the cells that \n had adhered stained positive for vimentin ( figure 1c ) . henceforth , we employed this pre - encapsulation 2d culture \n method , which not only removes dead cells , but also enriches the pdx \n tumor population via the depletion of mesenchymal cells .\na summary \n of the process used to form 3d pdx tumoroids within the ha - sh / peg - da \n hydrogel is illustrated in figure 1a . in the first week \n after encapsulation ,\nmda pca 183 cells were maintained as large tumoroids \n with most having diameters between 60100 m .\nmda pca \n 118b cells were maintained as smaller tumoroids , typically smaller \n than 60 m in diameter ( figure 2a and supplementary figure 1 ) .\ncells in tumoroids were \n in close contact in multicellular clusters , observed via staining \n with phalloidin for f - actin ( figure 2b ) . to \n demonstrate that human pca cells comprise the 3d pdx tumoroids , we \n stained the encapsulated cells for epithelial cell adhesion molecule \n ( epcam ) , an established marker for epithelial cells .\nas expected , \n both the mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b 3d pdx tumoroids stained positive \n for epcam ( figure 2c ) , indicating that the \n tumoroids form from self - sorting epithelial cells despite the presence \n of mesenchymal cells in the original xenograft tumors .\nadditionally , \n we also confirmed this by probing for the human - specific anti - nuclei \n antibody and found that the majority of cells within the tumoroids \n stained positive ( data not shown ) , indicating that the 3d pdx tumoroids \n form from largely human cells .\nnext , we asked if the pca cells in \n tumoroids retained their androgen receptor activation status . probing \n specifically for the androgen receptor , we found that while the androgen \n receptor was mainly localized in the nucleus of cells in the mda pca \n 183 tumoroids , nuclear localization of the receptor was not observed \n in the mda pca 118b cells as would be expected in vivo .\ngeneration \n of pdx tumoroids encapsulated within 3d ha - sh / peg - da \n hydrogels .\n( a ) mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b cells remained as multicellular \n tumoroids post - encapsulation , over 1 week in culture .\ncells were stained with dapi ( blue ) or phalloidin ( green ) ; \n a merged image is shown on the right panel .\n( c ) hydrogel - encapsulated mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b cells were \n stained with dapi ( blue ) , and with antibodies against epcam ( green ) \n and the androgen receptor ( red ) . while the mda pca 183 cells exhibited \n nuclear localization of the androgen receptor ( indicated by yellow \n arrows ) , the mda pca 118b cells stained negative for nuclear localization \n of the androgen receptor .\nencapsulation \n of the nonadherent tumoroids into ha - sh / peg - da hydrogels maintained \n cell  cell contacts for at least 2 weeks in culture .\ngiven that \n these pdx pca tumors exhibit poor viability in vitro on 2d , we next \n investigated whether the encapsulated pdx tumoroids remained viable \n within the hydrogels over time using the live / dead viability / cytotoxicity \n assay .\nas shown in figure 3 , cells in both \n the mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b tumoroids were predominantly viable \n at days 1 , 5 , and 14 . remarkably , pdx cells had the highest survival \n when they had formed large clusters with other cells .\ndead or dying \n cells in each hydrogel were observed to be one of two types : either \n single cells that had not aggregated with other cells to form multicellular \n clusters or cells on the periphery of each cluster ( particularly prominent \n in figure 3b , day 14 ) . beyond viability , to \n establish if the 3d pdx tumoroids demonstrate tumor growth characteristics \n necessary for the model to serve as a drug - testing platform , particularly \n for drug candidates that target actively dividing cells , we monitored \n their growth over 1 week in culture , using dna content as a surrogate \n measure of cellularity .\nnotably , the overall cellularity of the mda \n pca 118b constructs was lower than that of the mda pca 183 because \n the mda pca 118b cells formed smaller clusters , therefore the retrieval \n of cells for hydrogel encapsulation was less efficient than from the \n mda pca 183 cultures .\nthis is apparent from the finding that even \n though a higher theoretical seeding density ( 150,000 and 300,000 cells \n per construct for mda pca 183 and 118b , respectively ) was employed \n for the mda pca 118b constructs , the average initial dna content of \n the mda pca 118b constructs still was lower than that of the mda pca \n 183 constructs ( day 1 , figure 4a ) . in analyzing \n the cellularity of\nthe 3d pdx constructs over time , while dna content \n remained constant with no significant difference over time for the \n mda pca 183 tumoroids , there was a significant decrease in cellularity \n for the mda pca 118b from day 1 to 5 , after which an increase in cellularity \n was observed ( figure 4a ) . probing the 3d pdx \n tumoroids for ki-67 and cleaved caspase-3 , markers \n of proliferation and apoptosis , respectively , we found that differences \n in the proportion of proliferative and apoptotic cells at day 5 in \n culture was not apparent for either mda pca 183 or 118b ( figure 4b , c ) .\npanels in ( a ) and ( b ) show mda pca 183 and 118b after 1 , 5 , and 14 \n days in culture , respectively . cells were stained with calcein - am \n ( green , left panel ) or ethidium homodimer-1 ( red , middle panel ) .\n( a ) \n average cellularity of the 3d mda pca 183 and 118b constructs over \n 1 week in culture .\nupper panel of ( b ) and ( c ) shows the mda pca 183 \n and mda 118b tumoroids , respectively , stained with dapi ( left panel , \n blue ) and antibodies against ki-67 ( middle panel , \n red ) .\nlower panel of ( b ) and ( c ) shows the mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b \n tumoroids , respectively , stained with dapi ( left panel , blue ) and \n antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 ( middle panel , red ) the right \n panel shows a merged image where green indicates f - actin .\nhaving demonstrated \n that the encapsulated 3d pdx tumoroids are ( 1 ) made up of viable pca \n cells , ( 2 ) maintain in vivo - like androgen receptor distribution , and \n ( 3 ) are proliferative in the hydrogels , we next determined the suitability \n of this in vitro platform for drug testing of primary pca cells . given \n the inherent differences in origin between the mda pca 118b and mda \n pca 183 pdx models , we hypothesized that they would demonstrate a \n differential sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs . to test this hypothesis\n, \n we exposed the 3d mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b tumoroids to docetaxel , \n currently part of the first line regimen to treat patients with castrate - resistant \n metastatic pca .\nsurprisingly , we found that not only was there no \n overall difference in docetaxel sensitivity between the 3d mda pca \n 183 and mda pca 118b tumoroids , no significant reduction in cell number \n was detected within the range of docetaxel concentrations tested for \n either 3d tumoroid systems ( figure 5a ) .\nto \n confirm these findings , we performed the live / dead viability / cytotoxicity \n assay and found that cells were largely viable even at the highest \n docetaxel concentration ( figure 5b ) .\nadditionally , \n there were no apparent differences in the proportion of apoptotic \n cells as indicated by cleaved caspase-3 staining at the various docetaxel \n concentrations tested ( supplementary figure 2 ) . to demonstrate that the lack of cell - kill was cell source - dependent , \n we similarly exposed hydrogel - encapsulated cells from a bone metastatic \n prostate cancer cell line , c4 - 2b , to docetaxel .\ninterestingly , a significant \n decrease in cellularity was already apparent between 1 and 10 nm ( figure 5a , b ) .\nthis finding was corroborated by an observed \n increase in the proportion of ethidium homodimer-1-stained cells with \n increasing concentration of docetaxel ( figure 5b ) .\nnotably , given that viable c4 - 2b cells were present at 10,000 \n nm as observed by calcein - am staining , it is likely that the decrease \n in the proportion of calcein - am - stained c4 - 2b cells due to drug cytotoxicity \n could not be clearly discerned when compared to controls .\nwe also \n showed that the pdx cells were readily killed with 1 m sodium azide ; \n thus , it was likely not an issue of drug accessing the pca cells ( data \n not shown ) .\n( a ) average cellularity \n of 3d mda pca 183 and 118b constructs after exposure to increasing \n docetaxel concentrations , compared to the c4 - 2b cell line , also hydrogel - encapsulated . \n\nc4 - 2b cells exhibited significantly lower resistance to docetaxel \n as compared to both pdxs ( p < 0.05 ) .\n( b ) viability \n of cells after exposure to 0 , 10 , or 10,000 nm docetaxel , assessed \n by calcein - am staining ( green , left panels ) and ethidium homodimer-1 \n ( red , middle panels ) .\nin \n this study , we assessed a 3d ha - based hydrogel system for the \n culture of primary pdx bone metastatic pca tumors , well - known to exhibit \n poor viability when cultured on tissue culture plastic in vitro . given \n the ubiquity of ha in the bone marrow extracellular matrix and our \n previous studies that demonstrated the feasibility of using 3d ha - based \n hydrogels to culture poorly adherent bone metastatic pca cell lines , \n we hypothesized that these biologically active hydrogels would serve \n as excellent matrices to support the long - term culture of primary \n pdx pca tumor tissue in vitro .\nthe inability of bone metastatic \n pca cells , whether derived from \n cell lines or primary pdx tumor tissue , to grow in 2d culture is an \n established phenomenon that indicates the lack of critical components \n from the bone microenvironment upon which these highly adapted cells \n depend . in optimizing the culture conditions for the 3d pdx pca cells\n, \n we found that the cancer cells failed to adhere to tissue culture \n plastic , as was expected .\ninstead , these cells aggregated to form \n multicellular aggregates in suspension , where the formation of cell \ncell \n contact is a likely mechanism employed by the pca cells to adapt to \n the loss of native cell - matrix interactions . indeed , as proposed by \n shen and kramer , cancer cells are capable of undergoing  synoikis  , \n a term that was used to describe the avoidance of apoptosis by relying \n on intercellular adhesions in the absence of cell  matrix interactions .\nfocusing specifically on squamous cell carcinoma \n cells , the authors demonstrated that e - cadherin - mediated cell  cell \n contact resulted in the generation of compensatory survival signaling \n via the epidermal growth factor receptor .\ninterestingly , a similar observation was made by a landmark report \n by kondo et al .\ncell \n interactions were necessary for the survival of primary patient - derived \n colorectal cancer cells in suspension culture . in optimizing the culture method for the primary \n pdx pca cells , \n we leveraged the ability of the cancer cells to spontaneously aggregate \n to form multicellular clusters in suspension as a means to reduce \n the presence of  contaminant  cells such as dead cells , \n including those that were originally from the tumor tissue itself \n ( in regions of necrosis ) and those that were generated during the \n process of tumor digestion .\nwe found that the application of gentle \n centrifugation to retrieve the pca aggregates in suspension after \n 2 days on tissue culture plastic was an effective method to separate \n the pca cells from dead cells in suspension prior to encapsulation \n within the hydrogel .\ngiven that the pdx pca cells were maintained \n in mice prior to harvest , the cancer cells were also likely  contaminated  \n\nwith mouse - derived cells ( such as blood cells , endothelial cells , \n or fibroblasts ) , which consequently introduces a source of heterogeneity \n and complicates downstream biochemical studies .\nfurthermore , considering \n the importance of the tumor microenvironment in influencing tumor \n behavior , the presence of mouse - derived stroma may confound studies \n evaluating species - specific stroma - targeting drug candidates , hence \n making it a major hindrance in current pdx tumor models .\nindeed , while the pca cells formed aggregates \n in suspension , a population of cells was consistently observed to \n adhere to the tissue culture plastic surface .\nfor example , in mda \n pca 183 cultures , we found that the adherent cells expressed vimentin \n and originated from mouse tissue ( figure 1c ) . \n while further characterization is necessary to determine the actual \n yield of the cancer cells\n, these results , in conjunction with the \n observation that epcam , an epithelial cell marker , was near - ubiquitously \n expressed in all of the hydrogel - encapsulated pdx clusters ( figure 2c ) , highly suggest that the pre - encapsulation 2d \n culture serves as a desirable selective method to generate viable \n and enriched pdx pca cells in 3d . in this study , we optimized \n the culture of pdx pca cells in vitro , \n which to our knowledge is unprecedented . while robust growth was limited \n by a balance between proliferation and apoptosis , viability of the \n hydrogel - encapsulated pca cells\nwas notably well maintained even up \n to 14 days in culture ( figure 3 ) .\nten to 20% \n of cells within the 3d pdx tumoroids stained positive for ki-67 at day 5 in culture ( figure 4b , c ) , indicating that a subset of cells was still progressing through \n the cell cycle .\ncomparing the proportion of proliferative cells within \n the 3d mda pca 118b pdx tumoroids to their in vivo counterparts , we \n found that our estimate of ki-67-positive cells is \n well within the range of that in vivo .\nwe are currently modifying the ha - based hydrogel to study the effects \n of ecm moieties and other cell types on the growth behavior of the \n pdx pca tumoroids in 3d culture . with the shift in focus from \n traditional chemotherapy to biologically \n targeted approaches based on a mechanistic understanding of pca biology , \n preservation of salient features of\nthe original tumor is a critical \n criterion in evaluating the success of this culture system as a drug - testing \n platform . to this end\nthe androgen receptor is an important modulator \n for prostate growth and currently the primary therapeutic target in \n pca .\nadditionally , this nuclear receptor \n regulates psa expression , which is used clinically as a biochemical \n marker to track the progression of pca and response to therapy .\npredominantly cytoplasmic in the absence of \n ligands , ligand binding to the androgen receptor results in conformational \n changes , nuclear translocation of the ligand - bound receptor , and transcriptional \n activity . mirroring the in vivo tumor , \n detection of nuclear androgen receptor in the 3d mda pca 183 tumoroids \n\nindicates that the ha - sh / peg - da hydrogel system is capable of maintaining \n critical androgen receptor signaling in these androgen - dependent cells . \n\nsimilarly , nuclear androgen receptor was not observed in the 3d mda \n pca 118b tumoroids as would be expected in in vivo , indicating that \n these 3d pdx models may have utility as drug - testing platforms evaluating \n androgen receptor - targeting agents currently under intense clinical \n investigation .\ndrug discovery and screening \n has historically relied on cancer \n cell lines , which have generated a wealth of knowledge in cancer biology . \n\nhowever , the dichotomy in drug efficacy between preclinical and clinical \n testing is increasingly apparent , primarily attributed to the genetic \n and epigenetic changes that accrue when cells acclimatize to the in \n vitro culture environment in extended periods of cell culture . indeed , gillet et al .\nevaluated the multidrug \n resistance transcriptome of six cancer types and found no correlation \n between clinical samples and established cell lines , underscoring \n the need for new in vitro cancer models and primary tumor models .\nhypothesizing that inherent differences exist \n between traditional pca cell lines and pdx pca tumors , we evaluated \n the response of the 3d pdx pca tumoroids ( mda pca 183 and 118b ) to \n docetaxel and compared their response to the c4 - 2b bone metastatic \n prostate cancer cell line\n. docetaxel is a microtubule stabilizer and \n is currently part of the first - line standard treatment for metastatic \n castrate - resistant pca .\nwe found that \n despite the differences between the mda pca 183 and 118b cells in \n patient origin , their overall drug sensitivity to docetaxel was similar . \n\ngiven that both pdx - derived cultures showed a low number of proliferating \n cells and that docetaxel targets actively dividing cells , it thus \n was unsurprising that both demonstrated similar resistance to the \n drug in 3d culture .\nhowever , interestingly , the 3d pdx pca cells exhibited \n a significantly higher resistance to the drug as compared to the c4 - 2b \n cells .\nit is unlikely that the increased resistance is due to impaired \n diffusion of the drug into the hydrogel since it demonstrated clear \n efficacy against the hydrogel - encapsulated c4 - 2b cells\n. while results \n from this drug study are promising , studies are ongoing to establish \n clinical relevance and understand the mechanisms underlying this difference . with the increasing awareness\nthat irreversible biological changes \n occur when conventional cell lines are established in vitro , beyond \n prostate cancer , there is general shift toward the use of pdx tumor \n models for cancer research .\nhowever , their \n utility depends on the ability to manipulate the tumor cells ex vivo \n prior to implantation .\ngiven the alterations \n in biological properties associated with 2d culture , a few groups \n have taken steps to optimize methods to reliably grow primary tumor \n cells in 3d .\none such example is in colorectal cancer , where it has \n been shown that primary colorectal cancer cells can be cultured as \n 3d spheroids or colospheres in vitro , enabling the manipulation of \n the cancer cells before engraftment in vivo for controlled studies . in our current study , we demonstrate for the first time that primary \n bone metastatic pca cells can similarly be cultured in vitro with \n the use of a 3d ha -

{"id": 9, "text": "organisms often employ more than one mechanism to accomplish a task . for instance , animals typically navigate with multiple  input channels. the classic example is homing by the rock dove columba livia , for which magnetic fields , the sun , landmarks and geophysical processes have all been shown to be used ( wiltschko and wiltschko 2003 ) .\nthe range of behaviours or mechanisms organisms employ may be puzzling . at times , an apparent simplicity is observed .\neither have chemical defences to ward off herbivores or have symbiotic relationships with protective ants ( rehr et  al . 1973 ) .\nhosts parasitised by eurasian cuckoos cuculus canorus famously reject cuckoo eggs , but never reject cuckoo chicks ( davies 2000 ) .\nthis simplicity may be the result of evolutionary lag but , more interestingly , may also be caused by one strategy making another maladaptive by reducing predator abundance ( planqu et  al .\ndifferent mechanisms may complement one another , and true redundancy is often hard to show ( able and bingman 1987 ) .\nindeed , the existence of a suite of mechanisms against a broad ensemble of predators is readily understandable .\nanother striking example of a system in which different mechanisms augment and complement one another , but now at a collective level , is house hunting in social insects .\nthis has become one of the model systems to study distributed decision making in animals . when the nest is destroyed , the colony has to decide collectively where to settle next during a time of crisis ( franks et  al .\nindividual ants or bees have been shown to combine sophisticated assessments of potential nest sites ( seeley 1977 ; seeley and morse 1978 ; mallon and franks 2000 ; franks et  al .\n2003b ) with various recruitment mechanisms to collate information , and thus make collective decisions ( mallon et  al . 2001 ; pratt et  al . 2002 ; pratt 2005 ; seeley and visscher 2003 , 2004 ; visscher 2007 ) .\nwhen the old nest is destroyed , a fraction of ants goes out scouting to find a new home . upon finding a nest ,\nthe nest is assessed ( mallon and franks 2000 ) and ants start recruiting other ants to it with a latency that is inversely proportional to the perceived nest quality ( mallon et  al .\n2001 ) , using a process called forward tandem running ( mglich et  al .\n1974 ) . during a forward tandem run , a knowledgeable ant teams up with a nave ant .\nthe leader slowly progresses towards the new nest , each time waiting for the follower to catch up , thereby teaching her the way ( franks and richardson 2006 ) . through this slow recruitment process ,\nonce a nest population reaches a certain quorum threshold , the recruiters switch from slow tandem running to much faster social carrying , and transport the remaining passive ants and brood to the new nests ( pratt et  al .\nthis description has been the basis of several models ( pratt et  al . 2002 ; pratt et  al .\n. however , a behaviour commonly employed by these ants is usually not included ( but see pratt et  al .\nrecruiter ants are not only engaged in social carrying , but also regularly perform tandem runs from the new back to the old nest .\nthese so - called reverse tandem runs ( mglich 1978 ) are often more common than forward tandem runs ( mallon et  al .\n2002 ) , but their function is much less well understood . to maximise fitness , the colony should emigrate as quickly as possible to avoid predation and other hazards . therefore , during house hunting , a fast build up of recruiters is essential .\nwhy then do ants mix fast carrying with slow reverse tandem running , when they already have forward tandem running at their disposal ?\nin particular , through the use of mathematical models , we explore under what circumstances reverse tandem running can have a positive influence on emigration speed .\nwe present two mathematical models to investigate the possible role of reverse tandem runs in ant colony emigrations .\nreverse tandem running does not contribute to the decision - making process of which new nest to choose ( pratt et  al . 2002 ; franks et  al .\nonly a small fraction of the ants in a colony are actively involved during emigrations ( pratt et  al . 2002 ; langridge 2006 ) . in this paper , we thus divide the colony s n ants into fractions fn of active ants a , and ( 1    f)n passive ants p. this assumption to divide ants into active and passive is a crucial one , without which the models collapse .\nthe rates at which active ants leave the nest and become scouts , and scouts recruiters , are given by  and k , respectively .\nforward tandem running occurs at a rate  until the quorum q is met , after which recruiters carry passive ants and brood at a rate . to incorporate reverse tandem runs , we need to model which ants follow these tandem runs .\navailable data from nest - choice experiments ( mallon et  al . 2001 ) suggest two possibilities : either the reverse tandem runs are followed by ants that have not found the new nest yet , or by ants that have been carried to the new nest .\nthese two options are not necessarily mutually exclusive : the carried ants could have been scouts .\nmodel 1 assumes that reverse tandem runs are followed by uncommitted scouts in the arena , and model 2 assumes they are followed by passive ants that were carried to the new nest . \n\n1diagrams of the two different models for which reverse tandem runs are hypothesised to increase speed .\nthe parameters are explained in table 1 diagrams of the two different models for which reverse tandem runs are hypothesised to increase speed .\nthe parameters are explained in table 1 to capture in detail the influence of reverse tandem runs on emigration dynamics , we need to consider the following points : \n both tandem running and social carrying involve a pair of ants from two different classes .\nhence , recruitment can only occur if ants of both participating classes are available;once the quorum has been met , recruiters can not carry and perform reverse tandem runs simultaneously ( we also assume recruiters are not involved in other activities than these two ) .\nboth tandem running and social carrying involve a pair of ants from two different classes .\nhence , recruitment can only occur if ants of both participating classes are available ; once the quorum has been met , recruiters can not carry and perform reverse tandem runs simultaneously ( we also assume recruiters are not involved in other activities than these two ) .\nwe assume that ants of both classes are well mixed in the part of the arena ( or nest ) where they meet . with populations of ants of size x and y meeting ,\nthe number of ants that on average meet is then proportional to xy/(x  +  y ) .\nimportantly , the smallest class limits the interaction rate , as is to be expected .\nwe thus also have to specify how much post - quorum time recruiters spend on carrying or reverse tandem running ( they are assumed not to spend any time on other behaviours ) . before the quorum\nis met , the rate at which active ants at the old nest , a , become recruiters , r , through tandem running is given by ra/(a  +  r ) .\nnow let f be the fraction of post - quorum time spent on reverse tandem runs , and the remainder 1    f spent on social carrying . then the mean number of scouts becoming recruiters through reverse tandem runs is \n 1\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$$f\\lambda rs/(s+r).$$\\end{document}for carried ants becoming recruiters through reverse tandem running , we have by analogy \n 2\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$$f\\lambda rc/(c+r).$$\\end{document}similarly , the mean number of passive ants p that become carried ants is given by ( 1    f ) rp/(p  +  r ) .\nrecruiter ants should not perform reverse tandem runs when there are no scouts or carried ants left . therefore , we replace f by \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$\\bar f$\\end{document } in eqs .  1 and 2 , where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n\n\\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$\\bar f = \\min\\{s f , f\\}$\\end{document } and min { cf , f } , respectively .\nthe min operation is for computational reasons only and ensures that \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$\\bar f$\\end{document } decreases continuously but rapidly to zero as s or c decreases , respectively .\nwe drop the bar on \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$\\bar f$\\end{document } in the rest of the paper .\nforward tandem running only occurs before the quorum is met and carrying and reverse tandem running only after .\nthese are modelled with functions l , c and r , respectively , as follows . \n\n\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$$\\begin{array}{*{20}c }   { l{\\left ( { \\lambda , r , q , a } \\right ) } = } { \\left\\ { { \\begin{array}{*{20}l }    { { \\lambda \\frac{{ra}}{{r + a } } } \\hfill } & { { { \\text{if}}\\,r < q , } \\hfill }   \\\\    { 0 \\hfill } & { { { \\text{otherwise } } , } \\hfill }   \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right . } \\\\   { c{\\left ( { \\phi , r , q , p } \\right ) } = } { \\left\\ { { \\begin{array}{*{20}l }    { { \\phi \\frac{{rp}}{{r + p } } } \\hfill } & { { { \\text{if}}\\,r \\geqslant q , } \\hfill }   \\\\    { 0 \\hfill } & { { { \\text{otherwise } } , } \\hfill }   \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right . } \\\\\n\\end{array}$$\\end{document}and , setting b to a for model 1 , and to p for model 2 , \n \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$$r(\\lambda , r , q , b ) = \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } \\lambda \\frac{rb}{r+b}&\\quad\\text{if } r \\ge q,\\\\ 0 & \\quad\\text{otherwise}. \\end{array } \\right.$$\\end{document}to aid the reader , we state the full equations for both models .\nthe equations for model 1 are given by \n \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal } \n \\usepackage{amsmath } \n \\usepackage{wasysym } \n \\usepackage{amsfonts } \n \\usepackage{amssymb } \n \\usepackage{amsbsy } \n \\usepackage{mathrsfs } \n \\usepackage{upgreek } \n \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt } \n \\begin{document}$$\\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } \\dot a & = -\\mu a -

quorum time spent on reverse tandem runs . in model 1 , this reaches a full 100% in model 1 , but never so in model 2 .\noverall , the models predict that reverse tandem running should be used more than forward tandem running , and the quorum threshold lowered , if the recruitment latency increases by decreasing k ( scouting ants wait longer before starting their first recruitment act ) , in combination with either a decreasing fraction of active ants f , or an increasing scouting parameter . for all but very large f , the optimal quorum threshold corresponded to the time when all active ants have left the old nest to go scouting . in the absence of multiple new nests , the decision when to switch from forward tandem running to social carrying is thus best made at the old nest .\nrecruiters should thus apply the following rule : continue forward tandem running until there are no ants left to perform them with and then switch to social carrying ; if few forward tandem runs have been performed ( by the recruiters ) , combine carrying with reverse tandem runs ; otherwise , do not .\nthe numbers of forward tandem runs , reverse tandem runs , the numbers of carried ants in the new nest and total emigration time were computed for each of the optimal strategies of models 1 and 2 ( fig . \nfirst , for a large parameter range , there are more reverse tandem runs than forward tandem runs .\nthis is broadly consistent with the experimental data from nest choice experiments in mallon et  al .\nnumbers there range between 3 and 17 forward tandems , and between 9 and 25 reverse tandems , and reverse tandems were always performed more often than forward tandems .\nsecond , as a validation of our optimisation method , note that the optimal emigration time varies smoothly under parameter changes , as is to be expected for this type of model .\nthird , for model 1 , despite a clear drop in the post - quorum time spent on reverse tandem runs with increasing f ( see fig .  2 , top left ) , the number of reverse tandem runs in fact varies smoothly .\nfourth , the number of carried ants that remained in the nest at the end of the emigration is clearly different between models 1 and 2 . in model 1\n, this number is just ( 1    f)n , the number of passive ants in the colony . in model 2\n, however , over half of the colony may end up being recruiters by drawing recruits from the carried class using reverse tandem runs . \n\n3numbers of forward and reverse tandem runs , number of carried ants and emigration time , computed for each of the optimal strategies for models 1 ( top row ) and 2 ( bottom row ) , illustrated in fig .  2 .\nhere we have only illustrated k  =  0.001 numbers of forward and reverse tandem runs , number of carried ants and emigration time , computed for each of the optimal strategies for models 1 ( top row ) and 2 ( bottom row ) , illustrated in fig . \nto maximise their fitness , ants should try to achieve the fastest emigrations to minimise vulnerability ( franks et  al .\ntherefore , the active ants either have to become scouts , discover a new site and then become recruiters or wait at the old nest until a recruiter leads them to the new nest .\nboth of these processes may be hampered : when all the active ants go out scouting , recruiter numbers slowly increase if the new nest is hard to find or if those few can not find any active ant back at the old nest to tandem run with . in terms of the models , this could occur if scouts slowly become recruiters ( low value for k ) , in combination with either a small class of active ants at the old nest ( f is small ) or all active ants having gone scouting ( high value for scouting rate  ) . under\neither or both of these circumstances , the model predicts that ants should not waste time trying to recruit by forward tandem runs but should do the next best thing and use a low quorum threshold to quickly switch to carrying .\nthe recruiters should then invest a fraction of their time to recruit scouts or carried ants using reverse tandem runs , thus boosting the recruiter population and speeding up the emigration .\nconversely , the model also predicts that reverse tandem runs should not be used if either the new nest is easy to find ( recruiter numbers then build quickly anyway ) , or when there are many ants to follow a forward tandem run .\nants have been shown to leave their intact old nest if the new nest is sufficiently better , but have lower standards when their nest is destroyed ( dornhaus et  al .\nreverse tandem runs were mainly observed when the old nest was destroyed , combined with few forward tandem runs .\nthe model offers a simple explanation for this : the greater panic might have caused fewer scouts to remain at the old nest , thereby obstructing early recruitment . whilst investigating speed  accuracy trade -

making process ( franks et  al .\nthe first models in which reverse tandem runs have been explicitly incorporated to analyse their role have yielded clear predictions : under a range of conditions , we expect a negative correlation between levels of early and late recruitment .\nthis finding lends itself well to simple experiments , and we aim to present those in the near future .\nthe build up of recruiter numbers serves two purposes : to decide on a nest and to increase the number of ants actively involved in transport .\nthis in itself is a side - effect of the distributed nature of this system .\nthis suggests that such additional backup behaviours could be a common feature of decentralised collective decision - making systems .\nalthough evidence for which ants follow reverse tandem runs is scarce , both models give the same qualitative predictions .\nnote , however , that the dynamics of the different ant classes during a simulated emigration in model 2 poorly match observed experimental dynamics ( see , e.g. , planqu et  al .\nthe final number of ants active in an emigration is much greater than the original number of active ants .\nthese recruiter numbers far exceed observed numbers of active ants ( available in table 3 in pratt et  al .\nindeed , simulated emigrations often end with half the colony being recruiters and less than half carried into the new nest ( fig .  3 , bottom row , third from left ) . \n\n4examples of temporal dynamics for models 1 and 2 . at   =  0.05 , f  =  0.1447 , we have taken parameters optimal for models 1 and 2 , respectively .\nnotice that , in model 1 , the number of recruiters rises to about 35 , but in model 2 , there are no less than 100 recruiters at the end of the emigration , indicating that recruitment from the carried class ( model 2 ) may give rise to very unrealistic emigration dynamics examples of temporal dynamics for models 1 and 2 . at   =  0.05 ,\nf  =  0.1447 , we have taken parameters optimal for models 1 and 2 , respectively . notice that , in model 1 , the number of recruiters rises to about 35 , but in model 2 , there are no less than 100 recruiters at the end of the emigration , indicating that recruitment from the carried class ( model 2 ) may give rise to very unrealistic emigration dynamics\nfigure  2 ( top left ) shows that recruiters in model 1 should use a sequential strategy if f is small ( and  is large ) : when the quorum is met , they first spend all of their time on reverse tandem runs until all scouts have become recruiters , and then switch to carrying .\nthe total number of recruiters is bounded by fn , the number of active ants in the colony .\nas f decreases , the remaining recruiters take longer to carry all the passive ants . hence\n, the time costs for not having the recruiters increases and the time to recruit the remaining scouts decreases ( as there are fewer scouts too ) .\nhence , in this situation , recruiters should devote their post -

making process ( franks et  al .\nthe first models in which reverse tandem runs have been explicitly incorporated to analyse their role have yielded clear predictions : under a range of conditions , we expect a negative correlation between levels of early and late recruitment .\nthis finding lends itself well to simple experiments , and we aim to present those in the near future .\nthe build up of recruiter numbers serves two purposes : to decide on a nest and to increase the number of ants actively involved in transport . the decision - making process and the implementation of this decision are thus conflated .\nthis in itself is a side - effect of the distributed nature of this system .\nthis suggests that such additional backup behaviours could be a common feature of decentralised collective decision - making systems ."}

a and gnrh - ant protocols .\nin ivf cycles , along with the adverse effects of endometriosis on growing follicles , oocytes , embryos , and endometrium , ovarian endometrioma itself and its surgical resection may have an additional negative impact on the outcome .\nchoosing the appropriate ovarian stimulation protocol may prevent these adverse effects . in the present study\n, we tried to evaluate the efficacy of long gnrh - a and gnrh - ant protocols on patients that were specifically facing these detrimental factors due to prior laparoscopic endometrioma resection surgery . to our knowledge , there are no studies in the literature that specifically compare long gnrh - a and gnrh - ant protocols in patients with advanced endometriosis who have undergone laparoscopic endometrioma resection surgery . in the present study ,\nthe number of retrieved mii oocytes , grade 1 embryos , and aspirated follicles were higher in patients who received the gnrh - ant protocol , yet our findings did not reveal a statistically significant difference in pregnancy rates between the 2 protocols in which a similar number of embryos were transferred . furthermore , a similar number of embryo transfers revealed comparable fertilization and pregnancy rates between the 2 protocols .\nhence , the actual impact of gnrh analogues on ivf treatment may be on the ovarian response rather than on oocyte and embryo quality .\ncoagulation with bipolar cautery is usually considered a safe and well - accepted approach in laparoscopic endometrioma resection surgery , which was also the technique used in the present study . however , some studies in the literature indicated that this technique was associated with decreased ovarian reserve postoperatively .\nrecently , some studies investigated a vasopressin injection technique that may help clearly define the boundary between the cyst and the ovarian stroma .\nthere are multiple studies in the literature that evaluated the effects of endometriosis on ivf outcomes .\na meta - analysis about stage iii to iv endometriosis , which involved 22 studies , concluded that the fertilization , implantation and pregnancy rates , and the number of retrieved oocytes decreased in patients with endometriosis compared with the control subjects with tubal factor infertility .\nit has been argued that women with severe endometriosis were 36% less likely to achieve pregnancy than those with mild endometriosis were .\nthe same researchers presented that women with stage iii to iv endometriosis had fewer numbers of retrieved oocytes , lower e2 levels , and lower fertilization and implantation rates in comparison with women with stage i to ii endometriosis and women with infertility due to other causes .\ndocumented that patients with stage i to ii endometriosis had a lower fertilization rate , and patients with stage iii to iv endometriosis had fewer oocytes retrieved .\nfurthermore , when the researchers split the stage iii and iv patients with and without endometriomas , it was reported that the endometrioma group had significantly lower pregnancy , live birth , and ongoing pregnancy rates .\ncoccia et al showed the detrimental effects of severe endometriosis on ivf outcome via significantly reduced pregnancy rates ( clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer : 9.7% for stage iii to iv , 25% for stage i to ii , and 26.1% for tubal factor ) . in a very recent systematic review and meta - analysis , harb et\niv ) was associated with poor implantation and clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing ivf treatment .\nin addition , kitajima et al argued that presence of endometrioma is associated with diminished ovarian reserve .\nalthough there is no consensus on how to manage patients with advanced endometriosis and endometriomas , gnrh analogues have been used for the treatment of endometriosis for several years .\nthe use of gnrh - a during ivf treatment in patients with advanced endometriosis has led to increased pregnancy rates in some studies .\ngnrh - a may be suppressing endometriosis lesions in such patients . in support of this argument\n, patients who faced long - term suppression before the initiation of hyperstimulation with gonadotropins during ivf treatment had higher pregnancy rates .\nthe most efficient ivf / icsi stimulation protocol in endometriosis patients is argued to be the  ultralong \n( long - term pituitary down - regulation with a gnrh - a ) protocol , studied by many researchers , including surrey et al . a cochrane systematic review and meta - analysis performed by sallam et al established the advantages of this protocol with an odds ratio of 4.28 ( in favor of long - term pituitary down - regulation with a gnrh - a ) .\nalternatively , advantages of the antagonist ( eg , easier and faster prevention of premature lh surge , flexibility of use , increased patient comfort due to shorter usage ) make it an attractive choice for any ivf program .\nin a recent study by rodriguez - purata et al , pregnancy rate after coh with either gnrh - a or gnrh - ant was found to be equally effective in patients with endometriosis ( stage i to iv ) .\nthe number of retrieved oocytes might have an indirect effect on pregnancy rates , because higher - quality embryos can lead to more good - quality oocytes . in the literature ,\nthe results are varied when the protocols are compared with the number of retrieved oocytes . there was no statistical difference in some studies , whereas a meta - analysis by ludwig et al suggested fewer retrieved oocytes in patients who received a gnrh - ant protocol .\nalbano et al carried out a multicenter study and also documented that patients who received a gnrh - ant protocol revealed significantly fewer numbers of retrieved oocytes . in this study ,\nthe number of retrieved mii oocytes and follicles were higher in patients who received a gnrh - a protocol .\nit can be argued that higher gonadotropin doses may lead to more aspirated follicles and retrieved oocytes .\nhowever , we used similar total doses of gonadotropin in the present study in both groups , yet significantly fewer numbers of aspirated follicles and retrieved oocytes were recorded in patients who received the gnrh - ant protocol . when the protocols are compared for the pregnancy rates , there are contradicting results .\nseveral studies and various meta - analyses have been carried out to compare pregnancy rates of gnrh - a versus gnrh - ant protocols . a meta - analysis of 14 randomized studies found no significant difference between the 2 gnrh analogues in the pregnancy rate .\nsimilarly , ludwig et al did not report a difference at the pregnancy rate between gnrh - a versus gnrh - ant protocols .\nin addition pu et al reported no statistical difference to the number of oocytes retrieved , the number of mature oocytes retrieved , the cycle cancellation and clinical pregnancy rates between gnrh - a versus gnrh - ant protocols in poor ovarian responders . on the other hand , a cochrane meta - analysis by al - inany and aboulghar , which took into account 5 randomized studies , suggested that the usage of gnrh - ant protocol compared with gnrh - a provided lower pregnancy rates .\nhowever , the conclusions of this cochrane meta - analysis can not be generalized for the endometriosis patients .\nmerviel et al also reported lower pregnancy rates in patients who used gnrh - ant protocols .\nbecause of the risks involved with multiple pregnancies , which is a common occurrence in ivf treatments , the standard practice in many countries became the transfer of 1 ( elective single embryo transfer ) or 2 embryos instead of 3 . in turkey , the turkish ministry of health established a mandatory standard of single embryo transfer in march 2010 for all women under the age of 35 years , in their first 2 cycles .\nhence , cryopreserved embryos became an appealing alternative for patients who were unable get pregnant during their ivf treatment or who want to have another pregnancy later in their lives . with cryopreserved embryos , patients have the chance of a frozen - thawed embryo transfer , which can alleviate the emotional , financial , and physical burdens of an additional ivf treatment . in the present study ,\nthe gnrh - a protocol revealed increased numbers of oocytes and embryos , so the patients who received this protocol had an opportunity to cryopreserve and transfer embryos later .\nadditionally , cryopreserved embryo transfer might have an advantage for women with endometriosis , because ovarian hyperstimulation is not required in frozen - thawed embryo transfer , which may potentially activate the endometriosis .\nlimitations of the present study were the involvement of > 1 clinician and their preferences for different protocols ( long gnrh - a versus gnrh - ant ) and its retrospective design .\nin addition , differences in the skills of the surgeons , although in the present study all surgeons were experienced , might be considered as another limitation , as the ability to preserve normal ovarian tissue after endometrioma resection surgery varies according to the skill of the surgeon and the technique used . in our clinic\n, patients with endometrioma who have a diminished ovarian reserve ( afc < 5 , basal fsh  10 iu ) do not undergo surgery solely because of infertility .\nhence , another limitation was the fact that the subset of patients with poor response was omitted from the study .\ngnrh antagonists have been available commercially since the early 2000s , whereas gnrh agonists have been available for much longer . in our clinic ,\nalthough the learning curve was not steep , it could still be regarded a limitation of this study .\nlong gnrh - a and gnrh - ant protocols both present similar ivf outcomes in patients with endometriosis who have undergone laparoscopic endometrioma resection surgery .\nlong gnrh - a protocol may lead to a higher number of embryos , which can be cryopreserved , providing the possibility of additional embryo transfers without having to go through the process of ovarian stimulation again\n. however , further prospective research on larger sample sizes , in which live birth rates especially are evaluated , have to be carried out to compare the efficiency and success rates of the 2 protocols ."}

to - date .\nquality control is a relatively traditional method based on the assumption that errors are inevitable .\ntherefore , the way to control quality is to audit or control events to make sure of their constant elevation of quality , moving a step ahead .\nthe philosophy behind quality control is that what is good enough today might not be that good tomorrow .\nthe prime objective of total quality is customer 's satisfaction , which covers the whole organization .\nthat is , the objective of all units of the organization should be satisfying the customer .\ntotal quality management , is a way to improve efficacy , flexibility , and competitiveness of the organization .\nit covers all departments and resources of an organization in order to reach quality and satisfy the needs of clients and benefits of employees .\nthe second level is to satisfy their needs in a way that they return to us .\nthe third level is to furnish their needs more than they expect.[69 ] determining indicators of service quality include responsiveness ( the tendency and readiness of employees to provide services , punctuality and so forth ) , competency ( having necessary skills and knowledge to provide services ) , availability ( being accessible and easy to contact with ) , politeness and modesty ( flexibility , respect , consideration , friendly behavior ) , communication ( informing clients using understandable language ) , security ( free from danger , risk or doubt of clients about the service ) , trust ( consistency , and reliability ) , assurance ( trustworthiness , credibility , honesty ) , visibility ( physically visibility of the service ) , understanding / knowing the client ( trying to understand client 's needs ) .\nquality management in healthcare systems is an important issue because weak quality of services causes more diseases , disabilities , and costs , and less trust on healthcare system .\ngovernmental and private healthcare centers can improve services , reduce mortality and morbidity and increase quality of life by assessing , and consequently elevating quality . using quality assessment of services in healthcare center ,\nwe can study problems and deficiencies of the centers in terms of client care , infections , and mortality . analyzing the data\n, we can reduce the problems.[1016 ] with regard to the role of health care staff in providing services , it can be said that the success of an organization depends on the staff , so they must be aware of the quality of care in their organization .\na tremendous advance has taken place in terms of healthcare both in health status and in utilizing required resources .\nsince medical sciences are advancing , healthcare staff must be up - to - date .\n. showed that service provision in 40% of the staff was weal , in 31% was average and in 29% was good .\nin a cross - sectional study entitled satisfaction of parents of children under 1 year old , showed that most of the parents were moderately satisfied with the staff 's communication with them , but were highly satisfied with the availability and easy access of services .\nseyedoshohadaie et al . found no significant difference between private and governmental section in terms of doing regular pregnancy tests , and measuring and recording weight , blood pressure , etc , while a significant difference was found in terms of mother 's first visit , which was more complete in the private section .\nother services in iran found different results in terms of expectations of the current situation and desirable healthcare services.[2628 ] ehiri et al . from southeast of\nnigeria showed a better quality of services in the vaccination and prevention of diarrhea in children , but other aspects of primary healthcare services including controlling respiratory infectious diseases and other prevalent problems of children in that region were less attended to .\nshabrawy in riyadh found that only 50% of clients to 140 healthcare centers there , and one fourth were dissatisfied with long waiting .\nin other foreign studies , negative gap is seen between the expectations of the current situation and the desirable service provision in different aspects.[3136 ] with regard to the above studies , it is clear that there is a difference between different groups in terms of received services in five aspects of quality .\nbecause the results of previous studies can not be generalized to other healthcare services , each manager needs to conduct such studies in order to elevate quality in his organization .\nthat is how it is expected to have a model that is more applicable , and adaptable with the situation of the organization to remove the weaknesses and improve the quality beyond client 's expectations .\nthe present descriptive - analytic cross - sectional study was conducted on mothers who came to selected healthcare centers in isfahan .\ninclusion criteria were all women who came to selected healthcare centers in isfahan to receive primary health care like family planning , vaccination , child growth surveillance , and exclusion criteria included clients disinclination to participate or complete the questionnaire . because of the geographical distribution of the study population , cluster sampling was used .\nthe city was divided to 10 clusters , and one center out of each cluster was randomly selected .\nenough number of questionnaires was given to each center based on the covered population of each center .\nin the present study , sample size was estimated 1270 based on sample size formula .\nthis tool has 22 likert style questions , and has 5 dimensions of tangible or physical services ( 4 questions ) , reliability of services ( 5 questions ) , responsiveness or responsibility of service providers ( 4 questions ) , service assurance ( 4 questions ) , and empathy ( 5 questions ) .\nprimary healthcare clients were asked to express their opinion of the provided services ( understanding the current situation ) . at this stage , responders used one of the choices of ( very good , good , average , bad , and very bad ) to judge about the quality of the provided service . at the second stage ,\nthey were asked to express their opinion of how the quality of services should be ( expectation of the desired situation ) . at this stage , responders used one of the choices of ( really important , important , relatively important , unimportant , really unimportant ) to judge about the desired quality of services . each question scored between 1 and 5 .\nthe total of each service was added up to calculate the grand total , which was divided by the number of questions and multiplied by 100 to find the score based on 100 . to find the total quality of services ,\nthe scores of all questions were added up , and then divided by 22 ( the total number of questions ) to calculate the total quality score based on 100 .\nthe difference between quality of provided services and expected services was calculated by subtracting the two scores .\nvalidity and reliability of the tool was determined and adjusted for the iranian population after conducting a preliminary study on 25 clients . in the present study , tangible dimension of service quality meant physical space and condition of the service provision place including facilities , equipment and healthcare staff .\nreliability dimension meant the ability to provide the service in a certain and reliable manner .\nthe empathy dimension meant special treatment for each client according to her mood so the clients were convinced that the organization had realized them .\nspss software program was used to analyze the data . to compare client 's understanding and expectations for primary healthcare services ,\ndifferent sections of the study were designed in a way to avoid ethical issues as much as possible .\nin this study , 1280 women who came to isfahan healthcare centers participated with a mean age of 27.53 ranging from 16 to 49 years old .\ndemographics of studied women in terms of age , number of children , age of last child , mean monthly income , duration of pregnancy , and duration of using health care services table 2 shows the frequency distribution of the study population based on their education . accordingly ,\n22 people ( 1.7% ) were illiterate , 310 ( 24.1% ) had elementary school education , 322 ( 25% ) had middle school education , 550 ( 42.7% ) had high school education and 84 ( 6.5% ) had university education . according to this table , the highest frequency belonged to high school education , which can affect clients perception of expectations .\nfrequency distribution of participants based on education level forty - eight people ( 4% ) worked , and 1240 people ( 96% ) were housewives .\npregnant women comprised 16.1% ( 208 women ) , so the remaining 1080 women ( 83.9% ) were not pregnant .\npregnancy can affect the client 's number of visits to the health care center in that pregnant women go to health care centers not only for pregnancy care , but also for child care .\nthere were 610 ( 47.5% ) nursing mothers and the remaining 678 women ( 52.5% ) were not nursing .\nnursing shows that they had children under the age of 2 , who are more vulnerable and need more care .\nmean score of perception of the current situation of health care , and the desired expectation and quality gap in 5 dimensions of primary health care are shown in table 3 .\nnowadays evaluating the quality of healthcare services is one of the principles of improving quality of services , which clients pay an important role in . without their contribution and intervention ,\ntherefore , the first step in devising quality elevation programs is to recognize the clients perceptions and expectations of quality of services , and determine quality gap so it can be filled .\nfurthermore , because quality gap in different populations is different , the present study was conducted to determine the quality gap of primary healthcare services in isfahan .\nas can be seen in demographics , mean age of the studied population was 27.35 years ranging from 16 to 49 .\nmean number of children in the studied population was 1.5 with the minimum of 0 and the maximum of 7 children .\nthis figure can affect the usage of healthcare services in that mothers with more children go to the health care center more often ( for vaccination and child growth surveillance ) . mean monthly income of the studied families was average , which can affect using governmental healthcare services .\nlower economical status causes more usage of governmental healthcare services , while people with higher economical status use public services less . in this study , 208 women were pregnant with a mean gestational age of 4 months . as the gestational age increases , the number of visits to the healthcare center increases .\nthe results showed that in general , there is a negative quality gap in all five dimensions of services .\nthe negative gap shows that the expectations of clients were beyond their perception of the current situation , so there is a lot of space to improve and reach client satisfaction and desired healthcare services .\nthe least mean quality gap was seen in assurance and the highest mean quality gap was seen in the tangible dimension .\nfound the least quality gap in assurance and the highest in empathy dimension in healthcare centers in kashan .\nthe least gap was in tangible dimension and the highest gap was in the responsiveness dimension .\nmik and hazel studied a sample of women who went to a hospital in scotland .\nthey found quality gap in all five dimensions in that the least gap was in reliability and the least gap was in assurance dimension .\nkarydis et al . studied greek patients going to a dentistry center and found significant quality gap in all five dimensions , and the highest gap was found in the responsiveness dimension .\ncote and gagliano received clients opinion in clothing stores in southeastern states of the u.s .\n( alabama , florida , and georgia ) and found the highest gap in empathy dimension , followed by reliability and responsiveness dimensions , while the lowest gap was seen in assurance dimension .\nby continuously elevating and evaluating quality of services , there should be an attempt to reduce quality gap in planning . because the highest gap was in tangibles , empathy , reliability , assurance and responsiveness , the following message is useful for managers and planners of health care centers .\ncenters should be equipped with efficient and modern equipment , services should be provided at the promised time , and at the shortest possible time to the clients , staff and service providers should be available when clients come to the center , they should know up - to - date knowledge and skills , and realize client 's values and emotions .\nfurthermore , because the highest gap was seen in tangible and empathy dimensions , enough budget should be specified to equip healthcare centers . in addition , with regard to cultural characteristics of our country , measures should be taken to improve communication with clients in order to make them feel more comfortable and satisfied . to increase quality of empathy dimension\n, it is recommended that on the job training courses be held for staff on improving their communicative skills and consider the time that clients think is appropriate for receiving services .\nthat is , it reduces the quality in clients opinion , so it is recommended to pay more attention to dimensions that have higher quality gap ( tangible and empathy ) .\nthe findings of this study show that clients believe that all five dimensions have quality gap .\nbecause in total quality management system , clients satisfaction is the focus of all activities to improve quality of service , this part must make more attempts to satisfy clients . because clients find quality gap in the quality of services , it is recommended that clients opinion be considered in planning .\nto do so , one of the most sensitive actions is to establish a dynamic information and feedback mechanism between the organization and the service recipients .\nthe efficiency of such mechanism is the determining factor in success of organizations in reaching better quality .\nfurthermore , since lack of resources is one of the major obstacles in reaching more desirable quality , evaluating quality gap makes the management capable of budgeting in a way to have the best functioning in domains that can have the highest effect on clients perception and expectations of quality of services while preventing from quality loss .\ntherefore , the quality gaps seen in the research can be a guide for planning and budgeting .\nlikewise , as the results show , significance of mean differences in five dimensions can be divided to two priority groups for budgeting and improving quality .\ndimensions of tangibles and empathy are the first priority and dimensions of reliability , assurance and responsiveness are in the second priority .\nsince primary healthcare recipients were studied as a special group of service recipients , the results of this study can not be generalized to other domains of health and treatment system or other organizations .\ntherefore , it is recommended that each city and each manager in different health care centers should act independently to learn about quality gap in his center .\nsuch a comparison confirms the fact that quality gap in five dimensions is different in different groups of service recipients . that is why the results can not be generalized to other domains of health and treatment services and each manager needs to design quality improvement of his organization by taking the first step of conducting such researches .\nthis way , it can be expected that a more adaptable and applicable model be proposed to remove the weaknesses , and provide services beyond the expectations of the service recipients .\nnegative scores of quality in this study show that importance of such services for the clients .\nin other words , they show that the health care center acted weakly , so it is necessary to improve the quality of primary health care .\nwith regard to the mentioned points , it is necessary to emphasize that paying attention to quality or expenses alone can not guarantee persistent success , so both concepts ( quality and expenses ) are important .\nhowever , for each budget cut program , there should be a balance between quality and expenses of the services .\nthe basis of quality management and provision of persistent service quality needs great changes in attitude of managers and human forces in terms of providing services and working in organizations .\nchanges in organization culture , organization development and qualitative human force development , creating commitment to objectives of the organization , creating trust , replacing rivalry with cooperation and harmony , using quality improvement methods , emphasis on qualitative evaluation of activities instead of emphasis on quantitative monitoring and controlling , and many other activities can improve qualitative functioning and efficiency of organizations .\nit should be remembered that attention to human force and its development and improvement from different aspects ( qualitative and quantitative ) is a key solution to provide quality in the organization ."}

week\n, a debridement of superficial corneal layers was done to enhance good penetration of antifungal therapy .\nstatistical presentation and analysis of the present study were conducted , using the mean , standard deviation , chi square , and t - test by spss v.20 .\na total number of 66303 patients attended the outpatient clinic of ophthalmology department in tanta university during the period in which the study was conducted .\nour target was 361 patients with mycotic keratitis representing 0.54% of the total attendants , while those with nonmycotic keratitis accounted for 473 cases representing 0.71% of the total attendants of the clinic during that period . \n\nthe mean age for cases of mycotic keratitis was 49.18  2.28 years , while mean age for the nonmycotic group was 50.88  2.60 years . \n\ntable 1 shows that males in patients of mycotic keratitis were affected about twice more than females .\nthe same was found with the nonmycotic keratitis group ; they were 66.6% males and 33.4% females .\nhowever the difference was statistically insignificant between mycotic and nonmycotic groups as regards the sex (  = 6.4 , p = 0.739).52.4% of cases of mycotic keratitis were at the age group of 4060 years while it was recorded that 51.4% of cases of nonmycotic keratitis were at the same age group .\nthe difference between mycotic and nonmycotic keratitis was statistically not significant regarding the different age groups (  = 6.21 , p = 0.258 ) . \n \nthe mean age for cases of mycotic keratitis was 49.18  2.28 years , while mean age for the nonmycotic group was 50.88

at the age group of 4060 years while it was recorded that 51.4% of cases of nonmycotic keratitis were at the same age group .\nthe difference between mycotic and nonmycotic keratitis was statistically not significant regarding the different age groups (  = 6.21 , p = 0.258 ) .\nas shown in table 2 farmers ( unskilled workers ) represented the majority of cases ( 68.4% ) in mycotic keratitis group while they represented only 50.3% in the nonmycotic keratitis group .\nprofessionals and semiprofessionals represented only 2.2% of the mycotic group compared to 19.9% among the nonmycotic group .\nhousewives were more among the mycotic cases than the nonmycotic cases ; they were 20% and 13.3% , respectively .\nthe difference was statistically significant between cases of mycotic and nonmycotic keratitis as regards their occupations (  = 21.41 , p = 0.001 ) .\nas shown in table 3 , more than one - third of cases of mycotic keratitis were of large family size ( > 6 persons ) compared to the nonmycotic group ( 38.2% and 20.3% ) , respectively , while the percentage of cases with small family size ( < 4 persons ) was less than the nonmycotic group ; they were 20% and 36.6% , respectively .\nthe difference was statistically significant (  = 10.67 , p = 0.004 ) . \n\ntable 3 showed that 67.3% of cases with mycotic keratitis lived in overcrowded houses with crowding index > 2 .\nthere was no significant statistical difference between mycotic and nonmycotic keratitis regarding the crowding index (  = 3.03 , p = 0.081 ) . \n\ntable 4 showed that in cases of mycotic keratitis , 64.3% were rural residents compared to 56.2% among the nonmycotic group .\nthe difference was statistically not significant between mycotic and nonmycotic groups (  = 1.55 , p = 0.212 ) .\nas shown in table 4 , outdoor water supply represented about three - quarters ( 72.9% ) of the houses of mycotic cases and more than half of those of cases with nonmycotic keratitis ( 58.1% ) .\nthe difference was statistically significant (  = 4.95 , p = 0.025 ) . \n\ntable 4 showed that in cases of mycotic keratitis only 22.7% of patients had pipes system of sewage disposal in their houses compared to 45% in the houses of nonmycotic group with a significant statistical difference (  = 10.78 , p = 0.001 ) . from table 5 , it was found that among the mycotic group 61.5% of cases came within the first week from the onset of complaints while about a quarter ( 22.4% ) of cases came for ocular examination from 14 days up to 30 days .\nin nonmycotic corneal ulcers the majority ( 85% ) came within the first week of complaints and no one came after 14 days .\nthe difference between the two groups was statistically significant as regards the different periods of time (  = 25.63 , p = 0.3 ) . \n\ntable 6 and figure 1 revealed that aspergillus species constituted the majority of cases with positive cultures : aspergillus flavus in 29.1% of cases and aspergillus niger in 16.1% , and the least frequent species was candida albicans ( 3% ) .\nnegative cultures occurred in 15.5% of cases in spite of their improvement with antifungal therapy and their typical clinical findings for diagnosis . \n\ntable 7 showed that trauma either organic or nonorganic was the most frequent risk factor for both of mycotic ( 58.4% ) and nonmycotic ( 75% ) groups .\norganic ocular trauma was the most frequent risk factor in mycotic keratitis ( 38.2% ) while nonorganic trauma was the most risky for the nonmycotic group ( 45% ) .\nother risk factors included ocular surgery which represented 32.7% of mycotic cases compared to 0% among nonmycotic group .\nprolonged local antibiotics therapy was risky for 6.1% of mycotic keratitis compared to 0% among nonmycotic group .\nsystemic diseases represented the least frequent risk for mycotic keratitis ( 2.2% of the cases ) while it was 10.4% in nonmycotic keratitis .\nall cases of mycotic keratitis that had a history of ocular surgery had a mild course of corticosteroid therapy except in 22 cases that had a prolonged heavy course .\namong the mycotic keratitis cases , 127 cases ( 35.2% ) showed healing with faint nebulae , 193 cases ( 53.4% ) with dense vascularized leucoma , 23 cases with descemetocele ( 6.4% ) , and 10 cases ( 2.8% ) with perforation , and 8 cases ( 2.2% ) ended by endophthalmitis as shown in figure 2 .\ncorneal infections including fungal types are responsible for about 50% of corneal scarring in the developing world which is a significant cause of blindness .\nmycotic keratitis is a growing health problem in the developing countries representing from one - third up to 56% of total ocular infections .\nworld health organization reported that about 10 million all over the world were blind due to corneal infections in its program for prevention of blindness ( global initiative vision by the year 2020 ) [ 13 , 14 ] . in the present study , about half the cases of mycotic keratitis were at the age group from 40 to 60 years , and males were about two times more affected than females .\nthese findings were close to that of baradkar and others in 2008   in their study in india whereas they concluded that fungal keratitis affected males three times more than females and were more frequent in the age group from 20 to 50 years .\nmales are more affected because of their outdoor activity and movement in the surrounding environment which expose them to different risks such as corneal trauma . there were no significant statistical differences between cases of mycotic keratitis and those of nonmycotic keratitis as regards the age groups (  = 6.21 , p = 0.258 ) and sex (  = 6.4 , p = 0.739 ) .\n( i ) in this study , mycotic keratitis affected farmers ( unskilled workers ) more than other occupations in 68.4% of the cases followed by housewives in 20% .\nthese findings were consistent with moharram and his colleagues in 1999   in their study in assiut where 47% of cases of fungal keratitis were farmers and 20% were housewives .\nfarming was the main job for most of cases of fungal keratitis in other studies [ 11 , 1517 ] .\nmost of fungal species such as aspergillus , penicillium , mucorrhacimosis species , and cladosporium are soil fungi , so they contaminate vegetables and fruits .\nfarmers are usually exposed to trauma by organic matter ( such as dried rice stems or maize ) which facilitates invasion of the cornea by the fungi .\nthere was a significant statistical difference between cases of mycotic keratitis and the nonmycotic keratitis regarding their occupations (  = 21.41 , p = 0.001 ) .\nfarmers were more recorded among cases while professionals and semiprofessionals were more recorded among the control .\nprofessionals might be exposed to some risk factors such as the nonorganic trauma but rarely exposed to organic trauma which is associated mostly with fungal contamination . in this study organic trauma\nwas the most risky factor for fungal keratitis while nonorganic trauma was the most risky for the control group and this might explain the former finding .\n( ii ) this study reported that cases of mycotic keratitis belonged to large families ( 46 persons in 41.8% and more than 6 persons in 38.2% ) , with a high crowding index ( 67.3% of cases with crowding index > 2 ) , and about two - thirds ( in 64.3% ) of them were rural .\nthere was a statistically significant difference between mycotic and nonmycotic cases as regards their family size ( larger families among mycotic keratitis cases ) (  = 10.67 , p = 0.004 ) .\nthere were insignificant statistical differences between both groups regarding crowding index (  = 3.03 , p = 0.081 ) and rural residence (  = 1.55 , p = 0.212 ) .\nhowever in both of mycotic and nonmycotic keratitis the percentage of the disease was higher in large families , with a high crowding index and rural residence .\nthese were explained by the unsound health behavior and lack of health awareness especially in those living in overcrowded houses with bad sanitation .\nthese findings were in agreement with other studies [ 5 , 18 , 19 ] which reported that fungal and microbial keratitis associated with low socioeconomic status and rural residence .\n( iii ) as regards water sources , the outdoor water supply accounted for 72.9% of houses of mycotic cases compared to 58.1% among the nonmycotic cases with significant statistical difference (  = 4.95 , p = 0.025 ) . concerning sewage disposal ,\nmore than three - quarters of houses of mycotic keratitis ( 77.3% ) were by conservancy system compared to 55% of the houses in the nonmycotic cases with a significant statistical difference (  = 10.78 , p = 0.001 ) .\n( iv ) in conclusion , it was revealed that cases of mycotic keratitis lived in more deteriorated environment than the nonmycotic group .\nthis was consistent with gopinathan and his colleagues who reported in 2009 that cases of mycotic keratitis lived in poor insanitary environment .\nrautaraya in 2011 reported that eye washing with contaminated water could cause mycotic and nonmycotic keratitis .\noutdoor water and insanitary sewage disposal systems could affect personal hygiene and self - care with poor sanitation of houses together with spread of flies and insects that transmit organisms easily to healthy or unhealthy corneas . in this study ,\n61.5% of cases of mycotic keratitis came within the first week of their onset of complaints to seek medical care compared to the majority ( 85% ) in the nonmycotic group .\nabout a quarter of cases of mycotic keratitis ( 22.4% ) came to seek medical care after two weeks from onset of complaints compared to no one in the nonmycotic group .\nthe difference in mean time between both groups was statistically significant (  = 25.63 , p = 0.3 ) .\nfirst , some patients developed mycotic keratitis after ocular surgery and thought that their complaints were a normal sequence of the surgery , so they delayed seeking medical care . second , some other patients were posttraumatic and thought that the symptoms were a normal sequence of trauma .\nlastly , some patients were treated by mistake at first as nonmycotic keratitis till they were managed as fungal keratitis .\n( i ) it was found that 84.5% of patients were positive , while 15.5% were negative in spite of their typical clinical findings and their improvement with antifungal therapy .\nthese may be explained by some fungi present in deep stroma and so could not be obtained if superficial scraping was done or if scraping was obtained only from one area .\nthese findings were in consistence with rautaraya who reported that 25.4% of their patients showed negative fungal growth in spite of their typical clinical findings for microbial keratitis .\n( ii ) for the type of fungusisolated , it was found that aspergillus species were the most common ( 45.2% ) , either flavus ( 29.1% ) or niger ( 16.1% ) .\nthese results were in agreement with rautaraya and his colleagues in india who demonstrated that aspergillus species constituted the majority ( 27.9% ) of fungal growth in their study .\nthese findings may be explained by the more spread of aspergillus species in the environment specially spores which can survive hot and dry weather for long time .\naspergillus species existed in the soil and animal skin , so they were more frequent among the farmers in this study .\n( iii ) among aspergillus species it was found that aspergillus flavus constituted 29.1% and aspergillus niger 16.1% .\nthis was consistent with the findings of rautaraya study that demonstrated 15.8% for aspergillus flavus and 12.3% for other aspergillus species .\n( iv ) candida species were the least frequent type ( only in 3% ) ; that is in agreement with what was reported by rautaraya and others that candida species were the least common in their study ( 0.9% ) .\nour results revealed that , among a total number of 66303 cases examined during the time of the study , mycotic keratitis occurred among 0.54% of cases and the nonmycotic keratitis in 0.71% .\na study that was done from february 1991 to june 2001 by gopinathan and others in india demonstrated 5897 cases of suspected infectious keratitis ; 3563 ( 60.4% ) were culture proven ( bacterial : 1849 , 51.9% ; fungal : 1360 , 38.2% ; acanthamoeba : 86 , 2.4% ; mixed : 268 , 7.5% ) . among fungal cases aspergillus species were responsible for 28.9% of cases , fusarium in 35.6% , dematiaceous fungi in 19.3% , other hyaline fungi in 15.4% , and candida only in 0.8% . between september 1985 and august 1987 ,\n405 patients with corneal ulceration were examined at tribhuvan university teaching hospital in kathmandu , nepal . males and females\nthe most common predisposing cause of ulceration was corneal trauma , usually with organic agricultural materials .\npure bacterial cultures were obtained from 256 ( 63.2% ) of the patients , whereas pure fungal cultures were obtained from 27 ( 6.7% ) of the patients . in 41 patients ( 10.1% ) ,\nof 68 positive fungal isolates obtained , 32 ( 47.0% ) were identified as aspergillus species .\na 13-year study that was done in paraguay from 1988 to 2001 and included 660 patients with infectious keratitis revealed that 79% of cases were culture positive of which 49% was fungal growth .\nin a study done in ghana in 1995 , one or more organisms were cultured from 114 of 199 patients ( 57.3% ) , with the most common being fusarium species , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and staphylococcus epidermidis .\nfungi , alone or in combination , were isolated from 56% of the patients who had fungal growth , in total 122 patients ( 61.3% ) .\nthis work reported that , among cases of mycotic keratitis , organic trauma was the most prevalent risk factor ( 38.2% ) , followed by ocular surgery in 32.7% of cases then the nonorganic trauma in 20.2% followed by the use of topical antibiotics in 6.1% , and systemic disease ( such as diabetes ) was the least frequent in only 2.2% . on the other hand , the nonorganic trauma was the most frequent risk factor for nonmycotic keratitis ( 45% ) followed by the organic trauma ( 35% ) .\nfarmers were more exposed to organic trauma ( with rice or maize stems or others ) during farming so they were more exposed to mycotic keratitis .\nas regards the risk of ocular surgery among the cases , fungal contamination might occur preoperatively in those cases with negative cultures or postoperatively due to lowered body immunity ( by the stressful surgery ) and/or the use of a course of local and systemic corticosteroids with the surgery .\nin consistence with our findings , ocular trauma was the most frequent risk for either mycotic or nonmycotic keratitis in other studies [ 5 , 1522 ] .\n\n community awareness of the risk factors.restriction of the abuse of topical corticosteroids or antibiotics.mycotic keratitis should be suspected in every patient with a corneal lesion , specially the resistant one , and should be ruled out before commencing steroids and antibiotics.for a successful treatment , we need the following : \n proper early clinical diagnosis , proper laboratory diagnosis , initiating a broad spectrum antifungal drug till laboratory findings prove the specific drug , proper frequency of antifungal drugs , proper timing for

{"id": 14, "text": "in our recent article  sequestosome 1/p62 facilitates her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis through multiple signaling pathways  , we reported that the adaptor protein sequestosome 1 ( sqstm1 ) , also known as p62 , is required for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2)-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis in allograft and transgenic mouse mammary tumor models .\nour findings are similar to the results of an earlier publication on ras - induced lung cancer .\nthese 2 studies , taken together , implicate p62 in potent oncogene - driven epithelial tumorigenesis and suggest that p62 may be a therapeutic target in such malignancies .\np62 is a multidomain protein that governs a diverse array of signaling pathways , and its deregulation has been implicated in paget 's disease of bone ( pdb ) , neurodegenerative diseases , liver disorders , and cancer .\ntranscriptional activation of nf - e2-related factor-2 ( nrf2 ) and defective autophagy can both lead to p62 accumulation , whereas p62 in turn regulates nrf2 stability through its interaction with kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1 ) . upon binding to polyubiquitinated substrates\n, p62 serves as a cargo carrier to proteasomes and the autophagic machinery , where it is degraded along with the cargo .\nfurthermore , p62 is involved in nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) activation , receptor trafficking , extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 ( erk1 ) inhibition , and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) signaling . as a result ,\ndisruption of p62 homeostasis impairs disposal of toxic cellular waste , response to oxidative stress , and normal cell signaling .\nour interest in the role of p62 in her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis was initially triggered by previously published studies that reported increased p62 levels in her2-positive breast tumors .\nwe found that her2 overexpression results in p62 accumulation at the protein level , possibly due to her2-induced autophagy suppression as described in another recent study from our laboratory .\ntwo- and 3-dimensional culture of her2-expressing sqstm1 immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells ( immecs ) revealed that p62 is required for cell survival upon amino acid starvation and during lumen formation in acinar morphogenesis .\nas the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 ( pten)/phosphoinositide-3-kinase ( pi3k)/akt axis is known to promote cell survival and her2-mediated mammary oncogenesis , we examined the role of p62 in this signaling pathway .\nour results demonstrated that her2-induced activation of akt , glycogen synthase kinase 3  ( gsk3 ) and -catenin in mammary cells is dependent on the presence of p62 both in vitro and in vivo .\nfurthermore , our studies revealed a newly discovered role for p62 in pten regulation . in the presence of p62\n, her2 overexpression activates the pi3k axis while reducing pten protein levels in vitro and in vivo .\nin contrast , in the absence of p62 , her2-dependent activation of the pi3k pathway is suppressed in association with increased pten expression , suggesting that p62 is required for pten downregulation and resultant induction of pi3k signaling in her2-expressing mouse mammary tumor cells .\nwhether p62 also activates the akt / gsk3/-catenin axis independently of pten remains to be investigated .\ngiven the established role of p62 in activation of nf-b and the nrf2-driven antioxidant response , we also examined the impact of p62 loss on these pathways and found that in vivo activation of nf-b and nrf2 signaling in response to her2 overexpression also depends on p62 .\na limitation of our study is that we did not investigate every pathway that p62 is known to be involved in , such as the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway .\na role for p62 in her2-mediated regulation of the mapk pathway would not be surprising , as p62 has been reported to inhibit erk1 phosphorylation . nevertheless , and in accordance with the complex nature of cancer\n, our study shows that p62 contributes to her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis in an elaborate manner that can not be attributed to a single mechanism ( fig .\nfigure 1.p62 is a hub of multiple signaling pathways in her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis . in response to her2 overexpression in mammary epithelial cells\n, p62 is upregulated at the protein level , which in turn negatively regulates pten and activates pi3k signaling , thus leading to tumorigenic signaling cascades .\nit is also possible that p62 exerts its effects on the akt / gsk3/-catenin axis independently of pten downregulation .\nher2-induced p62 accumulation alters mammary ductal morphogenesis by enhancing side - branching while suppressing lumen formation , and promotes anchorage independence and cellular transformation in vitro , as well as mammary tumorigenesis in vivo .\nit is likely that p62 also plays a role in the metabolic reprogramming observed in her2-positive breast cancer cells , but how this affects mammary tumorigenesis remains to be investigated .\ngsk3 , glycogen synthase kinase 3  ; her2 , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ; nf-b , nuclear factor kappa b ; nrf2 , nf -

mediated protein degradation , it is possible that her2-induced p62 accumulation promotes pten degradation by either or both mechanisms .\nthorough exploration of the mechanism(s ) involved in p62-mediated pten downregulation in response to her2 activation will certainly be of great interest .\nanother finding of our study , which is intriguing and worthy of future investigation , is the observation that while p62 loss sensitizes her2-expressing mammary tumor cells to amino acid withdrawal , it also renders these cells more resistant to glucose deprivation .\ngiven that autophagy is activated as a prosurvival function in response to amino acid starvation , we entertained the idea that sqstm1 her2-expressing immecs cells might be autophagy - defective compared to their wild - type counterparts .\nhowever , and in agreement with an earlier report , our results showed that neither autophagic flux nor degradation of long - lived proteins is affected by p62 loss .\nit thus appears that her2-expressing mammary tumor cells survive in the absence of amino acids via a p62-mediated , but autophagy - independent , mechanism .\na possible explanation resides in the hypothesis that p62 may be essential for glycolysis upregulation , which is known to occur in breast cancer cells in response to her2 activation ; as a consequence , amino acid starvation may compromise her2-expressing mammary tumor cell survival only when p62 is lost and glycolysis can not be induced to sustain metabolic demands .\nif this is the case , her2-expressing mammary tumor cells with intact p62 and metabolism dependent on increased glycolytic rates are expected to be more sensitive to glucose deprivation than their sqstm1-null counterparts , which are probably metabolically adjusted to accommodate defective glycolysis induction under nutritional stress .\nsince our results are in complete agreement with this prediction , we propose that p62 plays an essential role in the metabolic reprogramming of mammary tumor cells with active her2 signaling . in summary ,\nour work identifies p62 as a hub of signaling and metabolic pathways in her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis and sets the stage for future studies focusing on the pathophysiology and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets in her2-positive breast cancer ."}

wave dispersion is considered as a specific , and sensitive marker of af . besides\ndilaveris et al . detected significantly higher levels of pd when compared with the healthy group .\nstill in the same study , the authors determined a pd value of 40 msec is quiet sensitive ( 83% ) , and specific ( 85% ) in the determination of af risk with a 89% positive predictive value . in another study ,\nhigher pmax , and pd values were detected in patients with paf relative to the healthy control group .\nstill , in our study , pd value of the fms group was determined as 45 msec which demonstrates that fms patients are under the risk of af , and paf . in many studies\nperformed , it has been found that anxiety detected in healthy individuals increased cardiac autonomic imbalance , and the risk of coronary artery disease .\nit has been demonstrated that increased qtd value is associated with increased sympathetic or decreased parasympathetic modulation .\nsevere degrees of anxiety were detected in the fsm group relative to the control group without any evidence of increased risk of vf or vt which might be related to the scarcity of our patient population .\nboth sympathetic , and parasympathetic stimuli can lead to the development of af via different mechanisms .\nif we consider the role of autonomic dysfunction in the etiopathogenesis of fms , observance of arrhytmias in fms should not be a surprisng finding .\nour study conveys importance , in that it revealed risk of af in patients with fms which was evidenced by the presence of pd in these patients .\nscarcity of our patient population , and evaluation of arrhytmias using only ecg are major limitations of our study .\nstudies to be conducted with a larger patient , and control groups will provide more precise data . besides , with holter recording of alterations in patients heart rhythms will enable us to obtain long - lasting information which will facilitate detection of arrhytmias .\nin conclusion , our study determined the presence of increased risk of atrial arrhytmia in fms disease .\natrial arrhytmias effect quality of life of the patients adversely , worsen preexisting disease , and also induce functional losses secondary to some ensuing complications .\nfms patients should be followed up in consideration of this issue , and especially their risk for atrial fibrillation should be kept in mind ."}
{"id": 16, "text": "in the previous issue of critical care , reintam and colleagues   report a novel scale for measuring gastrointestinal dysfunction , using as descriptors , feeding intolerance and intra - abdominal hypertension .\nthey demonstrate convincingly that their gastrointestinal failure score correlates in a graded manner with mortality , and adds prognostic power to the sepsis - related organ failure assessment ( sofa ) score .\nbut while the use of intra - abdominal hypertension as a measure of gastrointestinal dysfunction is novel , and reflects morbidity that was underappreciated 10 years ago , their scale falls short in providing a comprehensive measure of gastrointestinal dysfunction in critical illness .\nthe concept that the morbidity of critical illness arises through the development of potentially reversible physiologic failure of multiple organ systems was first articulated by arthur baue more than 30 years ago .\nit was further refined by the accp / sccm consensus conference of 1991 , which suggested that the process involved graded degrees of organ system dysfunction , and proposed the terminology ' multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ' ( mods ) to describe it .\nfirst , it recognizes that it is not a single event that jeopardizes the recovery of the critically ill patient , but rather an evolving state of physiologic insufficiency , often affecting organs remote to the site of the initial insult and necessitating the use of exogenous support to ensure survival .\nsecond , it reflects the clinical reality that the process is variable in its expression , with differing systems being involved in different patients . finally , and of most pragmatic importance , the process is potentially reversible , and survival is possible , though strongly and inversely correlated with the aggregate severity of the process .\nsome 15 to 20 years ago , there emerged a spate of efforts to provide robust and reproducible criteria for the objective measurement of organ dysfunction [ 4 - 7 ] .\nthese are strikingly similar in their architecture , a reflection not only of an emerging consensus on what organ dysfunction is , but also of the substantial intellectual collaboration of those who developed the scores .\nalthough the final products vary in specific details , they reflect an implicit consensus that a valid descriptor of organ dysfunction should meet certain criteria ( table 1 ) .\ncharacteristics of an optimal descriptor of organ dysfunction the rationale for quantifying organ dysfunction is not to provide another tool to predict the outcome of critically ill patients ; dedicated prognostic scores such as the simplified acute physiology score ( saps ) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ( apache ) do this more than adequately .\nrather , their purpose is to measure the evolution over time of a multi - dimensional process , to enable response to specific unmet needs .\nfirst , an organ dysfunction scale can serve as a measure of intensive care unit - related morbidity , and so reflect important , but non - mortal , outcomes in a complex patient population .\nsecond , it can provide an aggregate measure of whether an individual patient is improving or deteriorating over time  a common challenge in an illness characterized by improvement in some dimensions , and deterioration in others .\nthird , it can measure new morbidity arising in a patient whose risk of dying at the time of intensive care unit admission is quantifiable , but unalterable , and for whom the real goal of care is to prevent de novo morbidity . finally , it can serve as a more sensitive and informative outcome measure for a population of patients for whom mortality risk is heavily influenced by pre - morbid conditions , and survival per se is of variable importance .\ngastrointestinal failure was a classic feature in early descriptions of mods , and invariably measured as bleeding from acute stress ulceration of the stomach .\nbut stress ulceration has become distinctly uncommon , and so other metrics have been sought , including tolerance of enteral feeds , ileus and nasogastric drainage , intestinal ischemia , acalculous cholecystitis , and diarrhea . none of these have satisfactorily met criteria for face validity and utility as summarized in table 1 , and for this reason , gut dysfunction was omitted from the available organ dysfunction scales .\nfirst , tolerance of enteral feeding is subjective , and reflects a clinical decision  to withhold feeds \none would want to know how reproducible these criteria were when measured by different observers , and whether they showed a graded correlation with mortality risk ;

{"id": 17, "text": "application of science and technology for the detection and investigation of crime and administration of justice is not new to us .\nforensic odontology has been defined by the federation dentaire internationale ( fdi ) as branch of dentistry that , in the interest of justice , deals with the proper handling and examination of dental evidence and with proper evaluation and preservation of dental findings .\nit involves the identification of deceased individuals through the comparison of ante- and postmortem records .\nthe importance of communication , training , and evidence - based guidelines for collecting dental samples from the crime scene are essential to identify the offenders or victims .\nknowledge about recognizing a dental sample as evidence by the police personnel is important so that there is no loss of evidence .\nrecently , forensic odontology has evolved as a new ray of hope in the field of crime investigation due to its wide range of applications in the identification of human remains through dental records at the scene of crime such as domestic violence ( child abuse , spousal abuse , or elder abuse ) through bite marks and physical injuries , determination of age and gender of the living and deceased , and to testify as an expert witness in the court to produce forensic dental evidence .\nthe question always arises as to whether the police personnel need to know about forensic odontology , the reason being that dental remains provide an accurate source of identification of the victim or the suspect . in recent times , the occurrence of natural and man - made disasters is more frequent in india with increasing crimes like gang rape and child abuse . during such calamities ,\nthe bodies of the victims may become mutilated beyond recognition where the vital role of forensic odontologist comes into the picture in the identification of such individuals and probes into the depth of crime .\nas police personnel are the ones who arrive first to the crime scene and take the chain of custody , their knowledge regarding identifying and collecting the biological evidences , dental prosthesis , and hard tissues is required in the growing field of forensic odontology . to evaluate the awareness and compliance of forensic odontology among police personnel ,\na small questionnaire - based survey was conducted in the city of mysore , karnataka , india .\nthe survey included a study group of 400 police officers from mysore city , which included 320 trained police officers ( having more than 5 years of experience ) and 80 trainee police officers .\na questionnaire was designed to assess the awareness , knowledge , and status of utilization of forensic odontology science among the participants .\nthe questionnaire containing 14 questions [ table 1 ] was distributed among the two groups on a working day .\ninformation on the nature of the study was provided to all the participants and consent implied by an individual 's voluntary completion of the questionnaire .\nthe questions and the responses were coded numerically in order to facilitate data entry and analysis by spss version 17.0 .\nassociation between the different variables was tested using chi - square and fisher 's exact test .\nquestionnaire used in the study ( option a , considered as 1 that was the expected answer and all other options are considered as 2 for the ease of statistical analysis )\na total of 400 questionnaires were distributed among the participating police personnel and the response rate was 100% .\nthe working experience among the participants from the trained group in the department ranged 5 - 22 years .\neighty trainee police personnel were also included in the study to evaluate the recent advances in their training period . on analyzing the collected data\n, we found that newspapers were the main source of knowledge among a high proportion of subjects in both the trained and trainee groups ( p < 0.001 ) [ table 2 ] .\nthis shows that there was no access or protocol to the study material during their training period concerning the subjects and there were no provisions for them to attend workshops conducted by other professionals like dentists or forensic experts .\napart from the source of knowledge , the evidence - collection method is mainly based on the experience ( p < 0.001 ) of the trainee group .\nit was observed that 88% of the police officers collected evidence from the area of crime or calamity only on the basis of their experience , emphasizing no prior training in this field .\nour survey revealed that both the trained and trainee groups were interested in attending the forensic odontology workshops to expand their knowledge on the subject with the help of expert forensic odontologists . in our study , we also got the information that there is no protocol for evidence collection ( p < 0.001 ) that is statistically significant .\nno proper guidelines are followed for the mode of transportation of the collected evidence being available .\nof all the evidences collected during mass disasters , 95% was mainly circumstantial evidence like jewelry , clothing , or pocket contents .\nthe victim 's personal identification is mainly based on medical examination ( pervious surgery marks ) that showed ( p = 0.007 ) highly statistically significant value .\nthe result of the survey revealed that although the knowledge about forensic odontology is adequate , there is a lack of attitude and facilities in the application of this knowledge .\nkeiser - nelson defines forensic odontology as  that branch of forensic medicine which deals with proper handling , examination and presentation of dental evidence in best interest of justice .\n it is a specialized field of dentistry related to solving legal problems where dental evidence is used for identification of victims , suspects , and abused in organized crimes as the tooth is the hardest tissue in human body that is extremely resistant to chemical and physical changes .\nthe branch of forensic science consists of a crime scene investigator , forensic biologist , forensic pathologist , forensic toxicologist , and forensic odontologist .\nunfortunately , in india , forensic odontologists being involved in crime scene investigation are rare . in the current situation ,\ncrime scene assessment and evidence collection are normally the responsibilities of the police , which is a difficult and demanding exercise and it can only be brought to a successful conclusion if properly planned and with active involvement and participation of other agencies like forensic experts .\nour present study was conducted to analyze the awareness levels in the crime scene investigation ( csi ) officers , 99.8% showed that accurate identification method involves collecting the circumstantial evidences like clothing , jewelry , and i d cards .\nabout 99.4% of investigated events did not include forensic odontologists during their visit to the crime scene .\nthis shows that only 6% of chances remain where dentists can actively involve in crime scene investigation .\nthe crime scene investigators , as soon as they get the call of a crime event , reach the crime scene and collect the evidence with detailed measurements of the area , along with the sketch and diagrams of the scenes , photographs , documentation of the remains , and evidences , and then package , label , and transfer the evidences to the laboratory .\nthe forensic expert collects the evidence , interprets the results , preserves the evidence , and relays the result as an expert witness .\nevery incident , be it a crime , accident , natural disaster , armed conflict , or any other , leaves traces at the scene and provides extremely useful data for investigation and identification .\nthe goal of the subsequent investigation is to correctly interpret the facts , reconstruct the events , and understand the sequence of events .\narriving unprepared at the scene , especially without the commensurate equipment and expertise , may result in missed opportunities and compromise the entire investigation .\nthe reason why csi officers are doing most of the evidence collection is because of the lack of communication and restricted knowledge on the individual system .\nan uncoordinated approach can lead to misunderstanding , duplication of efforts , or to wrong assumptions that someone else is taking care of a particular assignment like police personnel or biologists collecting human remains without the presence of forensic odontologist . without clear assignments of the responsibility , important elements at the scene\nmay be overlooked , evidence may go unrecognized or worse , may be lost . having too many or inappropriate people\nforensic odontologist associated with the identification of the deceased and crime investigations are usually required to provide testimony in a court of law in the capacity of an \n an example of a case where forensic odontology has been applied successfully in solving criminal cases or to identify the offender or victim is as follows : assassination of the former prime minister of india mr .\nrecent tragedies and situations have shown the importance of dental evidence and the literature search covering the last 5 years that describe the novelties referred to buccodental studies in comparative identification , buccodental evaluation of reconstructive identification , human bites as a method for identifying the aggressor , and the role of dna in sex identification .\noral cavity is a rich and noninvasive source of dna that can be used to solve problems of a social , economical , or legal nature .\nforensic odontology can be implicated in human identification during mass disasters as the teeth and jaws are impervious to most types of injury , being well - protected from fire and mechanical trauma , and are highly resistant to postmortem destruction and dental decomposition .\nit is also used to identify domestic violence and child abuse by bite marks and laceration on the soft tissues of the mouth .\npalatal rugae patterns , lip prints , and cuspal inclination studies are the other tools of human identification .\nlack of knowledge about the importance of biological evidence many a times lead to the loss of evidence like a bite mark or lip print that may be destroyed by the case attender in hospital ; avulsed tooth , denture , or any prosthesis may go unnoticed by the evidence collectors .\nthis can be overcome by the knowledge and presence of forensic odontologist during evidence collection as a missing tooth gives hint of a missing link .\nto date back to history , forensic odontologist along with the police personnel helped in solving the terrible secrets of the serial murderer ted bundy and identified him as a rapist and murderer through his bite mark on a victim 's body .\nashith b. acharya played a vital role in proving guilty all the accused in the nirbhaya rape and murder case by examining the dental modules of the five accused sent by delhi police and comparing it with the bite marks on the victim 's body . through this study\nwe would like to ask dentists and forensic odontologists to conduct more workshops or hands - on programs to create the awareness among the police personnel regarding the application of forensic odontology in solving medico legal cases .\npolice personnel should know the various forms of accurate identification methods by matching ante - and postmortem details obtained from circumstantial and physical examinations .\ndental examination is a particularly important and effective method , the examination of teeth and jaws can only be properly carried out by forensic dental experts who will perform the oral examination as a part of general autopsy .\nthe obtained tooth , any maxillofacial prosthesis , or implants can be further used to analyze the age and sex of the individual by comparing the antemortem records obtained by the dentist .\ndentists should make it a point to preserve the documents and study models of the patient .\npolice departments should introduce a course on the utilization of forensic odontology in case solving during trainings for investigative officers .\nfamiliarization visits of investigative officers to forensic odontology centers will also help them know more about the recent advances in the field of forensic odontology .\nforensic odontologists play a major role in the identification of those individuals who can not be identified otherwise .\nrecent tragedies and situations have increased awareness concerning the importance of forensic dentistry in the identification of victims , especially in the current era in india .\nthe likelihood of future disasters due to terrorism , earthquakes , and other causes require dental professionals in india to be prepared for an expanded role .\nperiodic training and participation in routine death investigations will be helpful in providing the knowledge and team work is needed for a successful response ."}

fibers .\nlocal anesthetics induce sympathetic nerve blockade and vasodilation , thereby improving blood flow to the ischemic neural element .\nco - administration of hyaluronidase has also been used to enhance the effect of lysis of epidural adhesion .\nepidural injection of steroids and local anesthetics in patients with spinal stenosis has been shown to result in only short - lived improvements in pain and function , because the symptoms of spinal stenosis reflect a combination of pathological processes caused by space occupying lesions or fibrosis , such as interruption of blood flow , venous congestion , ischemia , axonal damage and intraneural fibrosis . since serial injections of conventional epidural steroids into our three patients did not result in symptom relief , we utilized an alternative technique focused on resolving the underlying pathophysiology of spinal stenosis , consisting of percutaneous epidural foraminoplasty with 3 fr fogarty catheters , balloon decompression of the epidural space of the intervertebral foramina , and administration of drugs to the target region .\nfogarty catheters were initially utilized in thrombectomy to remove fresh , soft emboli and thrombi from arteries and veins .\nusing its pliable distal tip , designed to minimize trauma to the venous valves , to manipulate around perineural structures enables a relatively safe procedure . instead of inflating with air , however , we used contrast medium , enabling visualization of ballooning and de - ballooning during the procedure .\nseveral factors may be responsible for post - decompression pain relief and functional improvement in our patients .\nfor example , balloon distension of the epidural space may result in effective mechanical detachment of perineural adhesion , which may play a role in restoring the mobility of the nerve roots to some extent , thus contributing to long - term symptom relief .\nmoreover , mechanical ballooning of a narrow intervertebral foramen may reduce venous congestion and mechanical irritation .\nvenous congestion has been regarded essential in precipitating circulatory disturbance , thus inducing neurogenic claudication .\nfurthermore , initial improvements of symptoms after the decompressive procedure may be due to local anesthetics and steroids that reach the areas causing these symptoms .\nballoon dilatation and adhesiolysis , however , may also contribute to the effective delivery of epidural injections to regions of spinal stenosis , thereby improving the effects of drugs in these target lesions .\nwe found that balloon decompression did not yield consistent results in our patients , which may be due to differences in disease severity and/or physical condition .\npatient one achieved 4 months of modest symptom relief , whereas patient two had 6 months symptom - free .\npatient three showed incomplete improvement , but this seemed acceptable because this patient was considered a candidate for a spinal cord stimulator .\nadditional studies involving more patients are needed to establish the proper criteria for selecting patients for balloon decompression .\npatient safety should also be considered in the effects of acute compression on spinal nerves .\nincreasing pressure and its duration have been found to induce more pronounced effects such as intraneural edema .\nthe safe limits of nerve compression in vivo have not been established , however , transforaminal balloon decompression would be regarded as safe if the balloon pressure is increased slowly and the procedure is limited to less than 2 - 4 h .\nthere have been previous attempt to use various balloon catheter for epidural adhesiolysis in patients with failed back surgery syndrome . to our knowledge\n, however , this is the first report describing the use of epidural balloon catheters to decompress the intervertebral foraminal space in the treatment of patients with spinal stenosis . over the past several years\n, minimally invasive surgical techniques have been introduced , using smaller incisions and more limited removal of the innate structure , to achieve decompression .\nalthough our case series provides only anecdotal evidence , the results suggest that transforaminal decompression using a balloon may have potential in the nonsurgical treatment of this condition by modifying the underlying pathophysiology of segmental stenosis .\nongoing randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes will address the effects of this treatment on pain improvement , functional score and claudication distance ."}
{"id": 19, "text": "it adopts a right - handed helically coiled conformation , the detailed structure of which is dependent on the localised sequence .\nwinding dna around its axis introduces supercoils increasing the free energy stored in the molecule ; winding in the same direction as the helix introduces positive supercoiling whereas winding in the opposite direction generates negative supercoiling .\nin addition to supercoiling derived from changes in dna twist , it is also a product of the coiling or bending of the helix in space , a parameter commonly termed writhe . twist and writhe\nare effectively inter - convertible and in a chromatin context it is useful to consider writhe as being of two types , constrained and unconstrained , the former resulting from direct physical wrapping around proteins or protein complexes . in prokaryotes , factors that package dna , such as hu proteins , may control supercoiling by binding to dna and trapping the free energy of supercoiling as writhe and subsequently releasing it through controlled dissociation . similarly in eukaryotes the regulated release of terminal dna from a nucleosome , mediated by the acetylation of core histone tails , could release constrained writhe for conversion into negative supercoiling .\nalthough in vitro studies support this concept   its operation in vivo is elusive . in prokaryotes and eukaryotes\nall activities that require dna to be unwound ( and rewound ) are potent generators of supercoiling .\nthe classic example is the  twin supercoiled domain model where elongating rna polymerase , in unwinding the dna , generates positive supercoiling ahead and , in rewinding the dna , generates negative supercoiling in its wake   ( figure 1 ) .\nthe levels of supercoiling produced in this process are prodigious , amounting to a positive and a negative supercoil for every 10  bp transcribed .\nconsequently the role of topoisomerases in releasing torsional stress is crucial if the template is to be maintained in a transcriptionally competent state .\ngenes that are negatively supercoiled are generally more efficiently transcribed   but topoisomerase inhibition studies   indicate that the accumulation of excessive positive or negative supercoiling will repress transcription .\ntherefore , there must be a regulated balance in the localised levels of supercoiling through the concerted actions of polymerases   and topoisomerases .\nif the ends of the molecule are not fixed ( or at least hindered ) , the supercoiling will dissipate via the unhindered rotation of the helix .\ntherefore for supercoiling to have a structural or functional influence on dna or chromatin it must operate within a constrained environment where the energy is at least transiently trapped or restricted . for this reason it is anticipated that genomes need to be organised into supercoiling domains with barriers that prevent the spread of topological stress . in prokaryotes the escherichia coli genome has a hierarchical organisation based on large structural macrodomains   with the ter domain being subdivided into smaller , 35  kb domains via mats / matp interactions .\nthis organisation establishes a dynamic structural architecture enabling packaging without interfering with transcription or replication .\nthe genome is also separately organised into about 500 independent 10  kb supercoiling domains with demarcating barriers stochastically distributed and dynamically maintained . however , as there are many more supercoiling domains than structural domains , the factors that define supercoiling boundaries must be distinct from those that characterise structural attachments .\nrecent studies show that the eukaryotic genome is also organised into large ( 1  mb ) loops , termed topologically associated domains ( tads ) . as these regions are invariant between cell types they appear to constitute a structural foundation to the genome and may not be directly relevant to functional activities such as transcription .\nas some ctcf sites also recruit cohesion this suggests they may be involved in forming and maintaining chromosomal loops and potentially act as supercoiling boundary elements . to understand the nature of eukaryotic supercoiling domains ,\npsoralen binding has been used in combination with microarrays to map the distribution of dna supercoils across entire genomes   or to particular chromosomal regions .\npsoralen preferentially intercalates into under - wound regions of the dna helix and is fixed by long wave uv - light . to study supercoiling across large chromosomal domains in higher eukaryotes naughton et al .  \nused a biotin - tagged psoralen molecule ( btmp ) and mapped the distribution of drug binding using microarrays ( figure 2a ) .\nanalysis of human chromosome 11 revealed this dna is divided into a series of relatively large ( 100  kb ) underwound and overwound domains .\nthese domains were relaxed by bleomycin treatment ( introduces dna nicks ) indicating they were , topologically , a dynamic genomic feature .\nmost strikingly , the patterns of these domains were transcription and topoisomerase dependent implying they were established by the competing activities of these enzymes .\napproximately 10% of supercoiling domain boundaries coincided with tad boundaries ( figure 2b ) suggesting that some of these structural interaction nodes could be barriers to the passage of supercoils .\nhowever , as supercoiling domains are approximately one tenth the size of tads the factors that define the majority of boundaries must be distinct from those that demarcate structural domains . in a similar approach kouzine et al .   also used psoralen to identify negatively supercoiled regions of the genome by isolating fragments of dna resistant to denaturation due to psoralen cross - links .\nthey focused on a subset of encode promoters and showed that dna supercoiling in these regions was restricted to relatively small foci ( 1.5  kb ) centred upon transcription start sites .\nsupercoiling was dependent upon transcription with active genes being more negatively supercoiled than inactive genes .\ninhibition of topoisomerases altered the pattern of dna supercoiling and suggested that different topoisomerases might function separately on more highly and less highly transcribed genes .\nthus , as in bacteria , eukaryotic chromosomes appear to be organised into structural loops , overlaid with both large ( 100  kb ) supercoiling domains and smaller supercoiling foci at transcription start sites ( figure 2c , d ) .\nthe relationship between supercoiling domains and foci is not evident but domains may arise by supercoil diffusion from promoters . the mechanisms that constrain these domains are also unclear .\nchromatin interactions may act as supercoil diffusion barriers but the inherent drag , and therefore reduced rotation , caused by higher levels of chromatin organisation could in itself be sufficient to form the basis of supercoiling domains .\nif these are not efficiently removed the residual energy may influence dna or chromatin structure locally , or , if the energy can be propagated along the fibre , at more distant sites .\nthe capacity of negative supercoiling to unwind dna and facilitate processes such as transcription   and replication and its ability to induce alternative dna structures such as cruciform , g - quadruplexes and z - dna   have been noted . to address how transcription - generated force might directly alter dna structure in vivo , kouzine et al .   used a tamoxifen - inducible cre recombinase to excise a chromatin segment with its torsional stress trapped intact .\nas the segment , flanked by loxp sites , had been positioned on a plasmid between divergently transcribing promoters it was demonstrated that as transcription intensified the degree of negative supercoiling trapped within the excised segment increased . using the c - myc fuse element as a reporter they showed that supercoiling could propagate along the fibre , melt the fuse element and promote the binding of ssdna binding proteins ( figure 3a ) .\nalthough negative supercoiling promotes transcription initiation , supercoiling can also hinder polymerase elongation . to investigate how polymerase responds to different supercoiling environments\nrna polymerase was immobilised on a slide whilst its dna template , attached to a quartz cylinder , was held in the trap .\nrotation and torque could be applied to and measured from the dna by manipulation of the quartz bead whilst its height provided a measure of displacement . upon transcription into a negatively supercoiled template , the polymerase initially relaxed the dna and then introduced positive supercoiling .\nin addition to facilitating the binding of polymerases or transcription factors , negative supercoiling can generate dna substrates for more complex activities . in yeast ,\ntopoisomerase i inhibition promotes the formation of large ssdna bubbles in highly expressed rrna genes , which can be visualised by miller spreads .\nhave shown that substantially smaller ssdna patches located within active genes ( figure 3b ) may be substrates for the mutagenic activity of activation - induced cytidine deaminase ( aid ) . employing an inducible gene in a hyper - negatively supercoiled e. coli strain they demonstrated that negative supercoiling increased ssdna patch density compared to wild type and promoted a higher mutation rate .\nit will be interesting to know whether a similar effect is observed in eukaryotic cells where the dna is packaged into chromatin and levels of supercoiling are probably buffered .\nin eukaryotic cells the effects of supercoiling have to be considered in the context of chromatin but unfortunately , we know very little about this situation . at the level of the  twin supercoil domain\nthe scenario seems simplistic ; positive supercoiling ahead of the polymerase will destabilize nucleosome structure and negative supercoiling behind will promote reassembly , actions that seem entirely consistent with the thermodynamic demands of transcription through a chromatin fibre .\nhowever , the many models that purport to explain the mechanics of how polymerase does in fact transcribe through a nucleosome reflects our ignorance of the details .\nthe idea that supercoiling might be generated at one site , say at a transcriptionally active gene , and then transmitted through the chromatin fibre to another location to create or remodel a domain or to influence a distant process , hinges on the concept that torsion can be transmitted along the fibre ( figure 4 ) .\nalthough we raised this issue , twenty - five years ago , the question essentially remains unanswered as the difficulty is multifaceted .\nwe do not have a good understanding of the structure(s ) that the higher - order chromatin fibre adopts , and yet this will undoubtedly constitute a profound influence upon the ability to transmit supercoiling .\nin addition , the composition and modification of the components of the fibre are also likely to affect its plasticity .\nnucleosomes containing yeast histones are more sensitive to thermally induced torsional stress   than nucleosomes containing higher eukaryotic core histones suggesting , perhaps , a greater propensity for yeast chromatin to absorb rather than transmit negative supercoiling . in spite of these reservations\npioneering single - molecule studies have attempted to provide an insight into this fundamental question . using magnetic tweezers to introduce torsional stress into model chromatin fibres bancaud et al\nto illustrate , they argued that supercoiling generated by transcribing 100  bp of dna could be absorbed within a 10  kb chromatin fragment thereby diminishing the need for topoisomerase relaxation .\nalthough such plasticity may not be typical of more condensed , native chromatin fibres , it does provide insight into the buffering capacity of chromatin to supercoiling and its transmission .\nalthough there is no direct evidence for the transmission of torsion through chromatin the phenomenon is used to explain the apparent dissipation of positive supercoiling near the ends of yeast chromosomes .\nthe rotation of the terminal 100  kb of the chromosome is argued to be the means of releasing positive supercoiling , in spite of telomere attachment and substantial rotational drag . in a related study kegel et al .   observed that inhibition of topoisomerase i and the build up of positive supercoiling caused replication delay in long but not short yeast chromosomes . from this\nthey suggested that supercoiling stress was more problematic for large chromosomes where its dissipation was less easily achieved through chromosome rotation .\ndna supercoiling also has a major role during dna replication and the subsequent condensation and separation of replicated chromosomes .\npositive supercoiling , generated in front of the dna polymerase during replication ( figure 1b ) , is relaxed by topoisomerases i and ii . however , when converging forks approach , relaxation of positive supercoiling is restricted and the build up of torsional stress causes swivelling of the replication complex required to complete replication .\nthis causes intertwining of newly replicated dna molecules behind the fork and the formation of precatenanes .\nsubsequently , most but not all catenanes are removed by topoisomerases ii . on approaching mitosis the remaining catenations , or sister chromatid intertwinings are  identified by a process that involves an architectural change in chromatin structure , orchestrated by condensin - generated and mitotic spindle - dependant positive supercoiling .\nthis structural change then allows topoisomerase ii to identify and resolve inter - chromosomal but not intra - chromosomal crossovers .\nconcomitantly , chromosome compaction starts during s - phase when condensin ii is recruited to replicated regions .\ncondensins introduce global positive writhe into the dna / chromatin in vitro   and as a result changes in supercoiling energy are thought to co - dependently drive mitotic chromosome architecture   and resolution in vivo . understanding how these processes are linked and determine the cytological chromosome structure will be key areas of future research .\na renewed interest in supercoiling research is clarifying how it influences nuclear processes and architecture .\nhowever , a lack of fundamental knowledge of the multilayered structures of its substrate , the chromatin fibre , and given that supercoiling is such an inherently elusive topological force , will probably demand the development of new and innovative experimental approaches .\nthe development of topologically constrained models of physiologically relevant chromatin fibres will enable studies of fibre stability , interplay between polymerases and topoisomerases and the propagation of supercoiling energy .\nwhilst minimally invasive probes are necessary to analyse chromatin structure and the distribution of supercoiling in vivo . with new approaches these will be exciting times for this area of research .\npapers of particular interest , published within the period of review , have been highlighted as: of special interest of outstanding interest  of special interest  of outstanding interest"}

blocking agents , antimalarials , thiazide diuretics ) , amalgam tooth fillings ( in lichen planus of the buccal mucosa ) , and hepatitis b or c infection .\nsince kossard 's original description of postmenopausal frontal fibrosing alopecia in 1994 , zinkernagel and treb reported in 2000 yet another form of fibrosing alopecia in a pattern distribution affecting the centroparietal area of the scalp , histologically with a lichenoid type of follicular inflammation and fibrosis .\nthe authors addressed the question how the lichenoid tissue reaction is generated around the individual androgenetic hair follicle , and came up with the proposition that follicles with some form of damage or malfunction might express cytokine profiles that attract inflammatory cells to assist in damage repair or in the initiation of apoptosis - mediated organ deletion .\nalternatively , an as yet unknown antigenic stimulus from the damaged or malfunctioning hair follicle might initiate a lichenoid tissue reaction in the immunogenetically susceptible individual . ultimately , in 2005 olsen acknowledged existence of clinically significant inflammatory phenomena and fibrosis in androgenetic alopecia and proposed the term  cicatricial pattern hair loss ,  while in 2010 kossard suggested that frontal fibrosing alopecia may hold the key to understanding the complex relationship of pattern alopecia , sex -

morbid condition , topical minoxidil and oral dutasteride may be of benefit , in addition to topical and/or systemic anti - inflammatory treatment modalities ( topical or intralesional corticoseroids , topical calcineurin inhibitors , and oral doxycycline , hydroxychloroquine , or mycophenolate mofetil , respectively ) .\nthe presented case of frontal fibrosing alopecia with nail involvement provides the evidence for underlying lichen planus , whereas favorable response to oral dutasteride may be related to co -

episode schizophrenia have revealed that the duration of untreated psychosis ( dup ) may be associated with short - term and/or long - term outcomes , that is , a longer dup is associated with a poorer outcome of schizophrenia ( 1 , 2 ) . also , according to mcgorry et al .\n( 3 ) , early therapeutic intervention during the prodromal phase of schizophrenia may influence the overall course of the disease . the onset of psychotic symptoms observed in schizophrenia is frequently preceded by nonspecific changes in behavior , emotional state , and/or cognitive state ( 4 ) , with common signs and symptoms of the prepsychotic stage of schizophrenia including sleep disturbance , anxiety , anger / irritability , depressed mood , deterioration in functioning , social withdrawal , poor concentration , suspiciousness , loss of motivation , and low energy ( 5 , 6 ) . therefore , it is critical that these signs and symptoms should be detected as early as possible to reduce the duration of the prodromal phase .\naccording to goldstein and lewine ( 7 ) , males with schizophrenia generally have an earlier onset of illness and a more severe form of the disease as reflected in greater cognitive or social impairment , while female patients are more likely to suffer from anxiety and affective symptoms ( 8) . this sexual difference is regarded as a consequence of different neuroendocrine and affective arousal systems ( 9 ) .\nthus , the early symptoms and signs experienced and observed during the prodromal stage of schizophrenia may differ between males and females with regard to their frequency and relationship with other clinical characteristics .\nhowever , relatively little work examined the gender difference of clinical manifestation in this population ( 10 ) , although several prospective studies examined gender as a predictive variable of conversion to psychosis and found mixed results ( 11 , 12 ) . therefore , in the present study , we examined gender differences in the prodromal symptoms experienced by the patients or observed by caregivers before the onset of first psychotic symptoms in patients with first - episode schizophrenia .\nwe hypothesized more affective symptoms in women and more cognitive or negative symptoms in men would be found during prodromal phase , as in patients with schizophrenia in previous studies .\nthis study was performed according to regulations on the use of human subjects established by the institutional review board of seoul national university hospital .\nwe reviewed the medical records of all patients admitted to the psychiatric inpatient ward between march 2005 and february 2007 in seoul national university hospital whose diagnoses at the time of discharge were schizophrenia .\nfirst , the admission records were complete with detailed present illness including all past psychiatric diagnoses , tentative dsm - iv multi - axial diagnoses , clinical global impression ( cgi ) and global assessment of functioning ( gaf ) scores .\nsecond , the discharge records were complete with definite dsm - iv multi - axial diagnoses , cgi and gaf scores , and signed by at least two psychiatrists .\nthird , the patients had experienced either delusions or hallucinations for at least 1 month , regardless of the subtypes of schizophrenia they were diagnosed with .\nfourth , from previous medical records , it was evident that patients had never been diagnosed with schizophrenia before the admission .\nthe authors discarded cases in which the section for present illness lacked the evidence for the dsm - iv diagnosis of schizophrenia , estimated onset of noticeable symptoms , or cgi and gaf scores .\nthe subjects either had never taken psychotropic medication or had received pharmacotherapy for less than 1 month .\npatients who met the criteria for substance use disorder , mental retardation , or major general medical conditions associated with psychotic symptoms were also excluded from the study .\na total of 214 patients were admitted during the study period and received a diagnosis of schizophrenia on discharge . among them , 63 patients ( 38 males , 25 females ) met these criteria .\nall had been admitted under the mental health act with the permission of at least one eligible caregiver .\nthe numbers of subjects diagnosed with each subtype of schizophrenia were as follows : paranoid ( n=46 ) , undifferentiated ( n=12 ) , disorganized ( n=4 ) , and catatonic ( n=1 ) .\nthirty - nine patients ( 25 males , 14 females ) had been treated with psychotropic medication such as antipsychotics , antidepressants , and benzodiazepines .\nthe onsets of the prodromal phase and the psychotic phase were estimated to the nearest 1 month according to the admission and discharge records by one of the authors .\nthe onset of the prodromal phase was defined as the appearance of the first symptoms noticeable either to the patient him / herself or to the caregiver(s ) that were considered to indicate the appearance of the disease .\nthe duration from the onset of prodromal symptom to the onset of psychotic symptom was considered as the duration of prodromal symptom .\nthe onset of the psychotic phase was defined as the appearance of active psychotic symptoms . in this study ,\nprodromal symptoms were categorized into 7 dimensions as follows : 1 ) attenuated positive symptoms ( unusual thought content , suspiciousness , unusual perceptual experiences , and disorganized speech ) , 2 ) negative symptoms ( social withdrawal , decreased energy , and flat affect ) , 3 ) cognitive changes ( difficulties with concentration and memory problems ) , 4 ) mood symptoms ( depression , elation , and irritability ) , 5 ) anxiety , 6 ) obsessive compulsive symptoms , and 7 ) somatic symptoms .\nthese dimensions were derived from the instrument for the retrospective assessment of onset of schizophrenia ( 13 ) and criteria of prodromal syndrome ( 14 ) .\nthe presence of symptoms from each dimension was determined 1 ) if the symptom dimension was directly mentioned in the medical record either in english or korean , i.e , for dimension of mood symptoms , phrases such as \" mood disturbance \" , \" depression ( or depressive mood ) \" , \" elation ( or elated mood ) \" , \" irritability \" or their korean equivalents or 2 ) if the authors could conclude the presence of symptoms from each dimension from the description of the subjects??thought , emotion and behavior from the medical record .\ndifferences in the frequency of prodromal symptoms between male and female patients were analyzed using a chi -

square test .\nclinical characteristics or duration of overall and individual prodromal symptoms were compared between male and female patients using a t - test .\ncorrelational analysis was used to examine the relationships between the duration of prodromal and/or psychotic symptoms and , cgi or gaf scale score at admission in each gender .\nthe mean age of the study population was 24.665.62 yr . the duration of prodromal symptoms and psychotic symptoms were 5.634.53 yr and 0.821.07 yr , respectively . on average , patients were admitted for 34.5725.53 days . at admission , mean cgi score and gaf scores were 5.710.58 and 35.0812.33 , respectively .\na total of 17 males had axis i psychiatric diagnoses , including obsessive - compulsive disorder ( ocd ) , adjustment disorder , social phobia , and major depression , prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms , whereas 12 females had prior axis i diagnoses , including bipolar disorder , major depression , and ocd before the onset of psychotic symptoms ( table 1 ) .\nas shown in table 2 , no significant differences were detected between genders in terms of age , age of onset , duration of psychotic symptoms before admission , duration of admission , as well as cgi and gaf scores .\noverall , the most common symptoms were attenuated positive symptoms ( 89% ) and mood symptoms ( 86% ) .\nhowever , the most common symptoms in males were negative symptoms ( 97.4% ) , whereas the most common in females were attenuated positive symptoms ( 84% ) .\nsignificant differences were observed in the frequency of negative , cognitive , and obsessive - compulsive symptoms between males and females .\na total of 37 males ( 97.4% ) and 14 females ( 56% ) experienced negative symptoms ( =14.16 , p=0.000 ) , and 29 males ( 76.3% ) and 10 females ( 40% ) experienced cognitive symptoms ( =6.96 , p=0.008 ) .\ntwenty males ( 52.6% ) and 5 females ( 20% ) experienced obsessive - compulsive symptoms ( =4.55 , p=0.033 ) .\nduration of symptoms from each of the 7 dimensions did not significantly differ between genders , although male patients suffered from negative symptoms for a longer period than female patients did ( t=1.754 , p=0.086 ) .\nfurther analyses showed that there was a significant negative correlation between the duration of negative symptoms ( 5.324.98 yr ) and gaf score at admission in male patients ( r=-0.341 , p=0.039 ) .\nour findings demonstrated differences in the frequency of prodromal symptoms between male and female patients with first - episode schizophrenia .\nnegative symptoms and attenuated positive symptoms were frequent in males , whereas attenuated positive symptoms and mood symptoms in females .\nin addition , male patients showed more frequent prodromal symptoms in negative , cognitive , and obsessive - compulsive symptom dimensions than female patients did . in several studies ,\na prolonged dup has been predictive of poor prognosis ( 2 , 15 ) and associated with sustained neuropsychological deficits , increased negative symptoms and disorganization , and unfavorable functional outcome of schizophrenia ( 16 ) . moreover\n( 17 ) suggested that the process underlying toxic brain damage may be halted by administering proper doses of olanzapine .\nso far , therefore , there have been many efforts to detect patients presenting active psychotic symptoms and decrease dup .\nhowever , prior to the onset of psychotic symptoms , many patients are usually suffering from various nonspecific symptoms , such as depression , cognitive impairment , or negative symptoms .\nadditionally , duration of the prodromal phase influenced grey and white matter volumes at the onset of psychosis .\nthat is , the severity of volumetric abnormalities in first - episode psychosis was correlated with the duration of the prodromal phase ( 18 ) . in light of suffering , functional decline and brain change of patients before the onset of active psychotic symptoms , strategies for early detection and intervention during the prodromal phase will likely gain further prominence in the clinical setting .\naccording to a retrospective examination of early course of patients with first - episode schizophrenia by hafner et al .\n( 19 ) , the 10 most frequent and earliest signs of schizophrenia such as restlessness , depression , anxiety , trouble with thinking and concentration , were reported by patients with a first - episode illness .\nno gender differences were observed in the earliest prodromal symptoms , except worrying , and the first signs of a prodromal phase were depressive and negative symptoms . whereas they reported the frequency of initial symptoms during the prodromal phase , we emphasized on the frequency of all prodromal symptoms that patients had experienced .\nthus , negative , cognitive , and obsessive - compulsive symptoms were more frequent in male patients than in female patients . cognitive change and negative symptoms such as social withdrawal and decreased energy , may be associated with impaired role functioning . in the present study ,\nthe gaf score at admission was inversely correlated with the duration of negative symptoms during the prodromal phase in male patients , although there was no significant difference in the gaf score between genders .\ntherefore , functional impairment in males may be influenced by the duration of negative symptoms even in the prodromal phase ( r=0.116 ) .\n( 20 ) that showed a correlation between impaired functioning in the prepsychosis period and increased negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum disorders .\npsychiatric syndromes such as mood disorders , cannabis dependence ( 21 ) , or anxiety disorders ( 22 ) are known to be often comorbid with prodromal schizophrenia . of 63 patients included in this study , 29 ( 17 males , 12 females ) had prior psychiatric axis i diagnoses before the onset of active psychotic symptoms .\ninterestingly , there were some differences in the frequency of psychiatric diagnoses between the genders , although a statistical power was not sufficient .\ndiagnoses among male patients included ocd ( n=4 ) , adjustment disorder ( n=4 ) , and social phobia ( n=3 ) , whereas diagnoses among female patients comprised bipolar disorder ( n=4 ) and major depression ( n=3 ) .\nfemale patients tended to have a diagnosis of mood disorder more often . on the contrary ,\nconsidering that both male and female patients had mostly attenuated positive symptoms during the prodromal phase , clinicians may need to pay attention to diagnose patients presenting mood symptoms or anxiety symptoms combined with attenuated positive symptoms .\nprevious studies have indicated that the dup and duration of the prodromal phase differ between males and females .\nhafner et al . ( 23 ) reported that the prodromal period was longer in females than in males , and the dup has been shown to be significantly longer in males than in females ( 24 ) .\nsome factors such as strength of social networks , degree of family involvement , gender difference in help - seeking behavior , and relative frequency of gender - specific stressors may lead to differences in the dup and the duration of the prodromal period between genders ( 10 , 25 ) .\nalthough no significant differences were observed in the dup and the duration of prodromal symptoms between males and females in the present study , the differences in the frequency of prodromal symptoms and prior psychiatric diagnoses , and correlation of the duration of negative symptoms with the gaf score at admission in male may have been influenced by several factors .\nfirst , females tend to express their emotions more readily and behave in a relatively unobtrusive way .\nthus , female patients may be more likely to be misdiagnosed , for example , to be a mood disorder ( 26 ) .\nsecond , a relative younger age at onset of the prodromal phase in males may also adversely affect their social and cognitive development , resulting in more frequent negative and cognitive symptoms and a negative correlation between the duration of negative symptoms and the gaf score at admission in male patients .\nadditionally , these phenomenological differences may be derived from neurobiological differences between males and females .\nestrogen protects neural circuits by reducing the sensitivity of d2 receptors in the central nervous system and by acting as a neuromodulator with agonistic effects on other transmitter systems , such as serotonin and glutamate ( 19 , 27 ) .\n( 28 ) conducted a positron emission tomography study to evaluate the striatal dopamine d2 receptor binding characteristics in 33 healthy males and in 21 healthy females and found that the female group had lower dopamine d2 receptor affinity than the male group .\nin addition , the prolactin response to neuroleptic medications was greater in females than in males .\n( 29 ) reported that among patients receiving treatment with risperidone , females were 2.6 times more likely to develop hyperprolactinemia than males .\nextrapyramidal and anticholinergic reactions were more frequent among female patients , whereas sexual problems were more frequent among male patients ( 30 ) . in terms of these neurobiological and symptomatological differences , males and females\ncould not be regarded as homogenous group , and therefore , clinicians and researchers should consider the role of gender in the evaluation and treatment of patients .\nthe onset of prodromal and active psychotic symptoms was determined according to the information provided by patients and their family members .\nhowever , we excluded cases whose sources were lacking and chose only cases with comprehensive information . furthermore , as all of our subjects were admitted for the first time , they may be less prone to recall bias compared to recurrent or chronic patients , although diagnostic stability of these patients may be somewhat compromised .\nsecond , as all subjects in our study were hospitalized , presumably having more severe symptoms , they might represent the patient population with more severe symptoms .\nthird , data in this study were descriptive and none pertained to the severity of prodromal and psychotic symptoms , except the gaf and cgi scores at admission .\nthe purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in the frequency of early symptoms and signs during the prodromal phase between male and female patients .\ntherefore , we did not have systematic data to evaluate the severity of symptoms . in conclusion\n, our present findings provide evidence for gender differences in the pattern of prodromal symptoms in patients with first - episode schizophrenia .\nalthough our study was retrospective and explorative in its nature , our result alone points that gender differences in prodromal symptoms should be considered when assessing patients presenting nonspecific symptoms combined with attenuated positive symptoms .\nfurther prospective studies exploring the relationship between gender differences in prodromal symptoms and long - term outcomes are warranted ."}

related deaths . of all urothelial tumors ,\nonly 5 - 6% occur in the upper urinary tract ( renal pelvis and ureter ) , and of these only about 615% are squamous cell carcinomas . among malignant renal tumors ,\nscc are decidedly rare neoplasms and form only about 0.58% [ 13 , 9 , 10 ] .\nover one year ( 1st january 2010 to 31st december 2010 ) , 15 patients with hydronephrosis and nonfunctioning kidney were operated at our hospital and one case of such an operation was sent to us for review . of these 16 cases ,\non reviewing all malignant renal tumors diagnosed in our department during the same time period , we found that rscc comprised 4/21 cases ( 19% ) .\nthe remaining cases comprised 11 cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma ( 52% ) , two cases of papillary adenocarcinoma ( 9.5% ) , and one case each of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma , one case of collecting duct carcinoma , one case of wilm 's tumor , and one case of transitional cell carcinoma ( 4.8% each ) .\nthe relatively high incidence of rscc in our series could be due to the referral pattern of our hospital , which is a tertiary care referral institute .  \ntable 1 shows the various clinical features and pathological findings of the cases in the present series .  \nmost of the current data of rscc is derived from small case series , over time periods ranging from 6 years to 27 years , and few isolated case reports [ 18 ] .\nthe predisposing factors leading to development of rscc are chronic irritation due to preexisting renal stones ( most commonly of the staghorn type ) or prior surgery for renal stones , analgesic abuse , or radiotherapy .\nchronic irritation induced by the aforementioned conditions , superimposed by infection , is believed to induce squamous metaplasia and subsequent development of leukoplakia and neoplasia in the urothelium , resulting in rscc [ 18 , 11 ] .  \nclinically , the mean age of presentation is 56 years , and contrary to earlier reports , there is equal incidence in males and females .\nthe involvement is unilateral , equally common on the right and left sides . presenting symptoms include loin pain , hematuria , and abdominal lump [ 1 , 2 , 4 ]\n. history of previous surgery for renal stone or staghorn calculi in patients of rscc has been reported variably from only 12.3% of cases in one series to 100% of cases in others [ 2 , 4 ] .\nli and cheung   reported an incidence of rscc in 2% of patients with recurrent renal stones . in the present series ,\nthe mean age was 60 years , m  :  f ratio was 3  :  1 , right side to - left - side ratio was 1  :  1 , and most common presenting symptom was flank pain .\nhematuria was observed in only one of our patients and may have been due to renal stones .\nthis is similar to the study by li and cheung . in all of our cases ( 100% )\nthere was presence of staghorn type of renal stones . in two of our four cases ( 50% )\nthere was history of prior surgery for renal stones and three out of four patients ( 75% ) had a history of bilateral renal calculi .  \nsignificantly , due to nonspecific and insidious presenting symptoms such as flank pain and hematuria , which often overlap with symptoms of renal stones , lack of specific radiological features , and rarity of this tumor , most cases of rscc are undiagnosed preoperatively and come to light only on histopathological examination of the excised non functioning kidney [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 ] .\na retrospective review of radiological findings in rscc showed that conventional radiological findings of filling defects , obstructive lesions or nonfunctioning kidney by intravenous urography ( ivu ) , which have been documented sporadically in   the literature , are all nonspecific .\nbecause of this , a renal tumor usually remains unsuspected and further radiological evaluation such as computerised tomography ( ct ) is not done routinely in every case , especially in developing countries , where the cost of these investigations is an issue .\neven ct imaging does not help in exact diagnosis , but may provide helpful information regarding the anatomical extent of the tumor .\nfound that the most helpful features in ct of rscc were presence of enhancing extraluminal and exophytic mass and , in some cases , an intraluminal component .\nthey further suggested , that as it is impractical to perform ct for every patient with renal stone , ivu should be done periodically , especially in long standing stones , and should be read as a split function test for all portions of renal parenchyma . in such cases , filling defects , delay in appearance of pyelogram , or renal parenchymal thickening should be regarded as renal tumor despite the   absence of mass effects and preservation of renal contour , warranting further studies by ct or biopsy from renal pelvis or calyces during treatment for renal stones . in the present series , similar to the literature ,\ndue to nonspecific clinical and radiological features , there was lack of confirmed preoperative diagnosis of a renal tumor in all our cases . in 3 of our 4 cases ,\nct was not done preoperatively as clinically , and on conventional radiology such as x - ray , ultrasonography , and ivu , the diagnosis was non functioning kidney with staghorn calculi and hydronephrosis . in 2 of these 3 cases ( cases 1 and 2 ) ,\ngross inspection showed only focal areas of thickening of pelvis which were extensively sampled and microscopic examination proved them to be rscc . in the third case , even though the diagnosis was evident on gross examination of the resected specimen , as almost the whole kidney was replaced by the tumor , even a retrospective radiological review did not show any evidence of a tumor , much to the surprise of our radiologists . in the fourth case , though no tumor was suspected clinically , a ct scan was performed and revealed a suspicious nodule present intraluminally in the region of the pelvis and histological examination advised .\nhence our series underlines the fact that rscc may be missed , clinically as well as radiologically , in a high number of cases , and the diagnosis may only be incidental during microscopic examination , provided extensive sampling of the kidney , particularly of the renal pelvis , has been done , specially if there is any area of thickening .\ndue to the above - mentioned reasons , most patients of rscc present at late stages , accounting for the poor prognosis [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 12 ] .\ncompared rscc with urothelial carcinomas ( ucs ) and found that though there was no significant difference in prognosis in advanced stage ( pt3 and pt4 ) rscc and uc , more patients of rscc presented at advanced stage ( 94% ) than uc ( 37% ) .\nhence , the outcome of rscc patients is poor with median survival of only 57 months after surgery and less than 10% alive after 5 years [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] . in the present series ,\nsimilarly three of our four patients ( 75% ) presented at advanced stage ( pt3 and pt4 ) . in one of the patients with stage pt3 ,\nthe nodal status was also advanced ( pn2 ) , upstaging the patient to stage iv .\nonly case 3 , the 50-year - old female , had a lower stage ( pt2 ) .  \nhistologically , nearly a fourth of rscc also shows other histological patterns focally including micropapillary , lymphoepithelial , small cell , and sarcomatoid .\nrscc with solid and papillary pattern has been seen in 14% of cases in one large series , and most cases are high grade . in our series , one of the four cases ( 25% ) showed a mixed solid and papillary pattern .\ntwo cases were of well - differentiated scc ( 50% ) ,   one of   moderate ( 25% ) and   one of poorly differentiated scc ( 25% ) .\nradical nephroureterectomy with excision of bladder cuff is the treatment of choice in patients without metastasis ; however , in view of the unifocal nature of this disease , parenchyma sparing surgeries have also been proposed [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 12 ] .\ncisplatinum - based adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are usually given due to the advanced stage and poor prognosis in most patients but have shown no survival benefit , highlighting the need for early diagnosis [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 ] .\none of our patients was lost to follow up , one died of intercurrent cad while the remaining two ( one pt2 and the other pt3 ) were on cisplatinum - based chemotherapy and surviving three and five months after surgery , respectively .\nprimary rsccs are rare tumors and show a strong association with renal stones , which might confound diagnosis\n. they may not be radiologically detectable and the first indication of malignancy might come incidentally on histological examination of nephrectomy for nonfunctioning hydronephrotic calculous kidney .\nthis emphasises the necessity of prompt treatment of renal stones and assessment for renal tumors in patients with long - standing staghorn calculi .\nthe high incidence of rscc in hydronephrotic kidneys in our series also highlights the need for meticulous sampling of the renal pelvis by the pathologist in such specimens ."}

type 2 : 8.4  1.8\nmmol / l ) , to maintain statistical power , the two types of diabetes were not distinguished .\nthese findings suggest that , if higher doses of insulin detemir are administered to achieve equivalent glycemic control to insulin glargine , the hypoglycemic time might increase .\nfurthermore , the intraday and day - to - day glycemic variability of insulin glargine was compared with those of insulin detemir .\nthe results of cgm revealed that sd and modd were lower with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir .\nthese findings suggest that insulin glargine might have better glycemic variability compared with insulin detemir .\nit is expected that the risk of hypoglycemia is lower with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir , if the aim of treatment is near - normal glycemia .\nseveral previous studies have compared insulin glargine with insulin detemir.1729 three studies using insulin - clamp tests yielded very conflicting results.1719 heise et al reported that the same doses ( 0.4 u / kg ) of insulin glargine and insulin detemir are very similar in terms of the mean shape of their pharmacodynamic profiles and duration of action in patients with type 1 diabetes.17 they also reported that the day - to - day glycemic variability is lower with insulin detemir .\nklein et al reported a similar duration of action and lower day - to - day glycemic variability with insulin detemir versus insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 0.81.6 u / kg).18 by contrast , porcellati et al reported that 0.35 u / kg of insulin detemir has similar effects to the same dose of insulin glargine during the first 12 hours , and that the metabolic effects of insulin detemir are lower at 1224 hours.19 six clinical studies have compared insulin glargine with insulin detemir . in five studies ,\nin which all patients or more than half of the patients were injected with insulin detemir twice daily , glycemic control was similar to that of once - daily insulin glargine.2024 the other study , in which the majority ( 87.4% ) of patients were injected with insulin detemir once a day , suggested inferiority of glycemic control for insulin detemir versus once - daily insulin glargine.25 these clinical studies clearly showed that , at similar daily doses , insulin detemir has a shorter action time and weaker action than insulin glargine .\nthese findings are consistent with the results of the present study and with the results of a clamp study reported by porcellati et al.19 tone et al compared the day - to - day glycemic variability of insulin glargine with that of insulin detemir.26 however , cgm was not used and the study evaluated only fasting plasma glucose ; therefore , the study was inconclusive .\nhowever , king et al and wiesli et al have reported comparisons of insulin glargine with insulin detemir using cgm .\nalthough these studies concluded that once - daily insulin detemir provided 24-hour glycemic control similar to that of insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes , did glycemic variability was not reported.2729 to the best of the present authors knowledge , the present study is the first to show that insulin glargine has better glycemic variability than insulin detemir based on cgm .\nfirst , because of the alert for insulin glargine , it was deemed inappropriate to continue enrolling patients to receive insulin glargine .\ntherefore , the number of subjects enrolled was too small to reach a definitive conclusion and patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were combined . however , as shown in figure 2 , most of the patients had lower modd values with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir .\nin fact , our finding of lower modd was consistent after stratification for the type of diabetes ( insulin glargine versus insulin detemir , type 1 : 2.7  1.2\nmmol / l versus 4.7  1.8 mmol / l ; type 2 : 1.8  0.9\nsecond , the doses of basal insulin used in the present study were different from those used in the earlier clinical studies .\nthe average basal insulin dose was 0.24 u / kg / day in this study ( type 1 : 0.22 u / kg / day ; type 2 : 0.26 u / kg / day ) , which was much lower than in earlier clinical studies ( insulin glargine : 0.33210.7525 u / kg / day ; insulin detemir : 0.40210.8223 u / kg / day ) .\nthe doses of basal insulin used in our study are similar to those used in the japanese national phase iii program for insulin glargine for japanese patients with type 1 diabetes ( mean : 0.21 u / kg / day)30 and insulin detemir for japanese patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes ( mean : 0.27 u / kg / day).31 therefore , the insulin dose in the present study appears to be appropriate for japanese patients .\nthe results of the present study suggest that insulin glargine provides more effective and more stable glycemic control than insulin detemir . because this study was too small to make a final conclusion , however , large - scale studies are required to confirm these findings ."}
{"id": 28, "text": "nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are commonly used for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee and hand.1,2 however , use of nsaids has frequently been accompanied by the occurrence of gastrointestinal,35 cardiovascular,6,7 and renal810 adverse events , which may be more frequent in the elderly population and in people with comorbid conditions , such as hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.9,11 oral nsaids should be used at the lowest effective dose in patients with osteoarthritis to minimize the potential for adverse events.2 the osteoarthritis research society international guidelines recommend topical nsaids as first - line therapy for patients with osteoarthritis and note that topical nsaids have equivalent efficacy and a lower frequency of adverse events compared with oral nsaids.12,13 the lower systemic availability of topical nsaids compared with oral nsaids14 may be the basis of the lower frequency of adverse events seen with topical nsaids in head -

related risks of gastrointestinal,35 cardiovascular,6,7 and renal810 adverse events effectively limit the usefulness of this drug class .\ncardiovascular disease26 as well as gastrointestinal disorders27 occur at a higher frequency in the elderly .\nmedications used to treat comorbid conditions in the elderly have the potential to interact with nsaids , further increasing the risk of adverse events.28 topical nsaids , such as dsg , can provide local pain relief as effectively as oral nsaids,16,18 presumably with more limited systemic exposure , thus reducing the risk of adverse events .\nan earlier analysis of pooled data from patients treated for 12 weeks with dsg indicated that the occurrence of most adverse events was similar in patients  65 years of age compared with patients < 65 years of age.22 in that analysis , a higher percentage of patients aged  65 years ( 8.8% ) reported application site dermatitis , compared with patients aged < 65 years ( 5.6%).22 the percentage of patients experiencing adverse events who had hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus , or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease was similar compared with patients who did not have these comorbid conditions.22 the post hoc analysis reported here extends the results of that study and indicates that dsg may be safely used over a longer period to treat knee osteoarthritis in patients at higher risk for the development of adverse events\n. the overall rate of adverse events was not increased in patients with hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus , or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease compared with patients without these comorbidities .\nlikewise , rates of gastrointestinal adverse events and application site dermatitis were not influenced by the presence of the comorbid conditions .\nthe incidence of cardiovascular adverse events was somewhat higher in patients with these comorbidities , but this is not surprising considering the well known associations between hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease , and the risk of experiencing an adverse cardiovascular event . given that the american heart association advises caution when using nsaids in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk,6 the favorable tolerability of dsg in patients with multiple comorbidities and associated elevated cardiovascular risk is of particular clinical relevance .\nit is especially important that dsg was well tolerated by the 15 patients with combined diagnoses of all three comorbid conditions .\nthis triad of disorders would include patients with metabolic syndrome ( a constellation of cardiovascular risk factors defined by world health organization as glucose intolerance , impaired glucose tolerance , and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus plus two of the following : central obesity , raised plasma triglycerides and/or low hdl - cholesterol , raised arterial pressure , insulin resistance , microalbuminuria , or impaired glucose regulation29 ) .\nthe incidence of metabolic syndrome is increased in patients with osteoarthritis.30 this post hoc analysis was limited by the small sample size of a number of the subgroups , particularly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease and those in the multiple comorbidity group , thus precluding statistical testing of differences in tolerability between subgroups . also , the protocol of the original study excluded patients with serious or unstable illness ;\nthus , some patients seen in clinical practice with hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease may be more ill than those studied in this post hoc analysis .\nfurther studies would be of value that specifically enroll patients with these comorbidities and do not exclude those with more serious illness .\nthe patients in this study were treated for knee osteoarthritis , and the results can not be extended to patients with osteoarthritis of the hand or other areas .\nanother limitation is the absence of comparator groups treated with placebo or an oral nsaid .\nnevertheless , this study provides clinically relevant data that are important for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and the physicians who treat them .\nthe results reported here suggest that long - term dsg treatment is safe in patient subpopulations with an elevated risk of nsaid - related adverse events .\ndsg may be safely administered as long - term therapy in elderly patients with knee osteoarthritis and in patients with comorbid conditions that predispose them to nsaid - related adverse events ."}

uropathogenic microorganisms on human sperm motility parameters and found significant decrease in sperm motility when spermatozoa were coincubated with s. aureus .\nsome authors have suggested that direct interaction between bacteria and spermatozoa facilitates immobilization of spermatozoa [ 79 ] , while others have reported evidence for soluble spermicidal factor produced and secreted by bacteria in the extracellular medium .   in an earlier work done in our laboratory ,\nwe have also been able to isolate a strain of s. aureus from cervix of an infertile woman , causing 100% immobilization of spermatozoa without agglutination .\nmotility of spermatozoa requires energy in the form of atp   that is provided by sperm mitochondria to power the flagellar motion that propels the sperm to the site of fertilization .\nit thus seems possible that the inhibition of sperm motility after treatment with sif may be due to decrease in the atpase activity or imbalance in the

.\n1  l peptide solution ( peptide extracts after tryptic digestion ) and 1  l of a suitable matrix , for example , alpha - cyano hydroxycinnamic acid ( hcca ) in 1  :  2 v / v of acetonitrile ( acn )

subsequent peptide spectra acquisition and analysis .\na laser power of 337  nm wavelength was used for ionization of the samples spotted on the target plate .\npeptide peaks were calibrated with peaks obtained from the peptide calibration standard . after peptide spectra were obtained , ms analysis was carried out using flex analysis software ( v 2.2 , bruker ) .\nsubsequent ms data analysis was carried out using biotools software ( v 2.2 , bruker ) and mascot search engine ( matrix science ) against the ncbi database .\nthe enthalpy of binding of ligand with the receptor was determined in pbs using a microreaction calorimeter .\nan amount of 1.5  ml of receptor ( 200  g  ml ) in buffer was placed in each of the calorimetric vials and 250  l syringe ( speed 3  l  sec ) was loaded with the ligand ( 500  g  ml ) .\nthe binding constant , k , and enthalpy of binding , h were computed by using iterative nonlinear least square regression method .\n\n s. aureus isolated from the cervix of a woman with unexplained infertility inhibited sperm motility by secreting the factor extracellularly .\npurified sif was a protein of about 20  kda with remarkable sperm immobilization activity . according to lc - ms measurements of the 20  kda band , the protein showed the peptide sequence similarity with hsp-70 protein when matched with proteins in the ncbinr database , using the mascot search program .\nthe search yielded a top score of 143 for hsp-70 like protein as shown by the histogram of the score distribution for the 20 best matching proteins .\nprotein scores greater than 57 ( p < 0.05 ) were considered to be significant .\nthe effect of purified sif from s. aureus on the mg adenosine triphosphatase activity of pooled and sonicated spermatozoa from human was studied . from the results ( table 1 )\n, it could be observed that the sif inhibited mg atpase activity of spermatozoa in dose - dependent manner . at a concentration of 100  g  ml of sif\n, there was no detectable mg atpase activity , whereas at lower concentration of 50  g  ml of sif , atpase activity decreased from 931.7  1.3 units ( control ) to 195.23  2.3 units .   when the effect of sif on human sperm acrosome reaction was studied two patterns of staining\nred or pink staining of the acrosomal region indicated intact acrosomes , whereas white , brown , or yellowish acrosomes were interpreted as acrosome - reacted .\nthe percentages of spontaneously acrosome reacted spermatozoa in sif - treated samples were comparable to control ( dmso ) . on treatment with calcium ionophore , majority ( approx .\nhowever , spermatozoa incubated with sif in htfm ( with 1% hsa ) failed to undergo acrosome reaction in response to calcium ionophore challenge ( figure 1 ) . when sperm samples treated with fitc labelled sif were observed under fluorescent microscope , bright green fluorescence was seen over the spermatozoa which depicts the binding of sif with spermatozoa .\nthis indicates that some receptors might be present on the surface of spermatozoa to which sif binds ( figure 2 ) .   according to maldi - tof analysis of the purified 62  kda band ,\nthe protein showed the peptide sequence similarity with mhc class ii antigen when the resulting spectrum was used to search for matching proteins in the ncbinr database , using the mascot search program .\nthe search yielded a top score of 68 for mhc class ii antigen ( protein scores greater than 66 are significant ; p < 0.05 ) .  \nthe binding constant , k ( 1350/m ) , and enthalpy of binding , h , ( 11.9  kj  mole ) were computed from the experimentally calculated enthalpy of interaction between ligand and receptor , using iterative nonlinear least square regression method ( table 2 ) .\nthe values of free energy and entropy were found to be 18.57  kj  mole and 21.53  j  molek , respectively , calculated from the following equations : \n ( 1)g=  rtlnk,s=(hg)t .\n\n s. aureus is an aggressive , opportunistic gram - positive pathogen that colonizes the skin , anterior nares , axillae , pharynx , and urogenital tract of 20% of healthy humans .\njiang and lu reported s. aureus as the predominant flora in infertile men with a significant decrease in sperm motility .   in an earlier work done in our laboratory ,\ns. aureus causing immobilization of human spermatozoa was isolated from the cervix of a woman with unexplained infertility , and a sperm immobilization factor ( sif ) was purified .\nreported that heat shock proteins ( hsp ) are immunodominant antigens of numerous microbial pathogens , for example , chlamydia trachomatis , which have been recognized as the main cause of infertility .   to further elucidate the contribution of sif to reproductive failure ,\nthe effect of purified sif from s. aureus on the mg atpase activity of spermatozoa was studied and the results showed that sif decreased the atpase activity .\nthere was no detectable mg atpase activity when spermatozoa were incubated with sif at concentration of 100  g  ml .\nany agent affecting atpase activity of sperms affects the motility of spermatozoa making it incapable of fertilization .\nfor example , in case of sea urchin spermatozoa , it was observed that motile sperm had an atpase activity of 0.16  m pi ( min  mg protein ) , while sperm that had been rendered nonmotile by homogenizing had an activity of 0.045  m pi ( min  mg protein ) , suggesting inhibition of mg - dependent atpase could be one of the possible mechanisms of sperm immobilization .\nalthough the rate of spontaneous acrosomal reaction of spermatozoa does not correlate with the success rate of in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) , the index of inducibility , measured by the difference between induced ( after incubation with calcium ionophore or exposure to low temperature ) and spontaneous acrosomal reaction , is of prognostic value for sperm fertilization capacity .\nwhen the effect of sif on human spermatozoa was studied , it was found that the percentages of acrosome - reacted spermatozoa obtained in tests treated with sif were consistently lower than those obtained in calcium ionophore - treated samples ( positive control ) .\nbacteria including ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis have been demonstrated to have a negative effect on ionophore - induced acrosomal reaction of human spermatozoa in vitro [ 26 , 27 ] .\nel - mulla et al . also studied the effect of e. coli on acrosomal reaction of spermatozoa .\nit was shown that the inducibility of the acrosome reaction was significantly lower in semen samples pretreated with e. coli than in the control samples .\nthe results demonstrated that e. coli affect the inducibility of the acrosome reaction in vitro and may impair the fertilizing capacity of human spermatozoa .\nseveral studies have found that sperm responsiveness to acrosome reaction inducers is reduced in infertile patients .\ntherefore , sif inhibiting the induction of acrosome reaction may be impairing the fertilizing capacity of human spermatozoa . from the results it appears that the effect of sif on inhibition of mg atpase may be separate from ionophore\nmediated acrosome reaction as disrupted spermatozoa were used for the estimation of mg atpase activity while intact spermatozoa were evaluated for acrosome reaction .\nfurther , when the fluorescent microscopy of spermatozoa incubated with fitc labelled sif was done , bright green fluorescence was seen over the spermatozoa surface .\nthis binding between sif and spermatozoa gives direct evidence that some kind of receptors might be present on the surface of spermatozoa to which labelled sif binds .\ntherefore , in the present study , an attempt was made to extract , purify , and characterize the receptor from spermatozoa that is responsible for its interaction with sif produced by s. aureus .\nmaldi - tof studies of receptor indicated that receptor shows sequence similarity with mhc class ii antigen when matched with ncbinr database .\nthese results are in agreement with those of earlier studies by morimoto et al . who clearly demonstrated the expression of the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class ii molecules on murine sperm cells by means of radioimmunoassay as well as by enzyme immunoassay .\nthe study revealed that the site of sperm for binding foreign dna was mediated by the complex structure of the mhc class ii molecules localized at the posterior region of sperm head .\nligand association with the receptor typically involves changes in the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and dynamics of the system components .\nthe changes in bonding interactions that occur upon ligand binding are reflected in the reaction enthalpy and entropy , which in turn determine the free energy of receptor - ligand association .\nmicrocalorimetric instruments and methods are essential tools for the general understanding of binding thermodynamics of biological macromolecules and specific biological systems . in the present study , when microreaction calorimeter was used to determine the free energy ( g ) , enthalpy ( h ) , and entropy ( s ) of binding of sif with purified receptor it was observed that reaction was exothermic as heat was produced which indicated specific interaction between receptor and purified sif . from the above preliminary observations , it can be concluded that sif isolated from s. aureus could bind to spermatozoa and sperm surface protein might act as receptor for binding to sif .\nthe study also indicates that receptor - ligand interaction might be responsible for immobilization of spermatozoa by sif .\nthus , the future studies of detailed molecular mechanisms of sperm immobilization by these receptor - ligand interactions could possibly lead to useful insights for improvements in the treatment of infertility , and in attempts to create safe as well as effective sperm immobilizing contraceptives ."}
{"id": 30, "text": "cellular senescence is a complex stress response that renders cells incapable of cell division , even in the presence of growth stimuli ( campisi , 2013 ) .\nsenescent cells are distinct from quiescent cells , which retain the ability to proliferate in response to appropriate stimuli .\nsenescent cells are also distinct from post - mitotic cells and terminally differentiated cells , which generally lose the ability to divide as a consequence of developmental , as opposed to stress - activated , programs . a senescence response is typically induced by cellular damage ( often nuclear dna damage or mitochondrial dysfunction ) ( von zglinicki et al . , 2005 ;\nas part of the senescence response , senescent cells express a number of non exclusive markers , including the cell cycle inhibitor p16 and elevated levels of a lysosomal enzyme termed senescence associated  galactosidase ( sa gal ) ( rodier and campisi , 2011 ) .\nmany senescent cells also secrete several cytokines , growth factors , and matrix metalloproteinases , collectively termed the senescence associated secretory phenotype ( sasp ) ( coppe et al . , 2008 ) , which differ from those secreted by non senescent quiescent , post mitotic , and/or differentiated cells .\nsenescent cells can alter tissue homeostasis and promote age related diseases , including degenerative pathologies and cancers ( campisi , 2013 ; van deursen , 2014 ) .\nthe inability of senescent cells to proliferate can impair tissue regeneration after injury , causing prolonged or permanent tissue damage with age .\nin addition , the sasp factors that are secreted by senescent cells can alter tissue microenvironments through their paracrine effects and promote age related phenotypes ( coppe et al . , 2008 ) .\nindeed , removal of senescent cells in a premature aging mouse model reduced selected age related pathologies such as sarcopenia , cataracts , and loss of subdermal adipose tissue ( baker et al . , 2011 ) .\nwhile cellular senescence is often viewed as a negative contributor to tissue function during the aging process , senescent cells , and particularly the sasp , can also have beneficial effects , such as the promotion of proper wound healing .\nthis aspect of senescent cells could explain why cellular senescence evolved and has been preserved during evolution , even though it contributes to age related phenotypes later in life .\nhere , we discuss how cellular senescence can be both beneficial and detrimental during skin aging and wound healing , and how the contrasting cell autonomous and non cell autonomous effects of senescent cells can depend on the physiological context . on the one hand ,\nsenescent cells can accelerate aging phenotypes through the loss of tissue homeostasis by promoting chronic inflammation , persistent degradation of the extracellular matrix , and stem cell exhaustion .\non the other hand , senescent cells can also play essential roles during wound healing by limiting excessive proliferation and fibrosis and promoting the formation of granulation tissue .\nintrinsic aging , sometimes termed chronologic aging , refers mainly to sun protected areas of the skin .\nintrinsic aging is associated with morphological changes primarily in the epidermal layer , manifest as marked thinning and loss of undulation ( flattening of the dermo epidermal junction ) ( makrantonaki and zouboulis , 2007 ) .\nintrinsic aging also reduces subcutaneous fat and dermal thickness with an accompanying loss of cellularity and vascularity ( farage et al . ,\nin contrast , extrinsic aging , particularly photoaging ( sun exposure ) , markedly affects both the epidermal and dermal layers , with the latter showing a striking loss of collagen and extracellular matrix ( quan et al . , 2004 ; quan et al . ,\nmitchell , 1967 ) , which are due to formation of structurally different elastic fibers ( watson et al . , 2001 ) .\nsenescent cells increase with age in both the epidermis and dermis , as determined by elevated levels of sa gal activity and p16 expression ( dimri et al . , 1995 ; krishnamurthy et al . , 2004\n; ressler et al . , 2006 ; waaijer et al . , 2012 ) .\nbecause senescent cells can not proliferate , their presence in aged skin can potentially impair tissue homeostasis , regeneration , and youthful tissue structure / function ( campisi , 2013 ; signer and morrison , 2013 ) .\nfor example , in a three dimensional organotypic culture model using neonatal dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes from human donors of varying ages , increasing the expression of p16 in keratinocytes isolated from young ( 3040 years ) donors yielded a thin epidermal layer similar to that formed by keratinocytes from elderly ( 5366 years ) donors ; decreasing the expression of p16 in keratinocytes from elderly donors transformed the aged skin phenotype of a thin epidermal layer into a thicker epidermis , similar to that formed by keratinocytes from young donors ( adamus et al . , 2014 ) .\naside from the cell autonomous effects of non - proliferating senescent cells on skin homeostasis , sasp factors secreted by senescent cells are also thought to contribute to skin aging phenotypes in a cell non autonomous manner .\nsasp factors , especially the matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) , become elevated with age and can alter the tissue microenvironment and accelerate skin aging phenotypes ( table 1 ) .\nmmps can degrade collagens , including type i collagen , which is the most abundant protein in the dermal extracellular matrix ( ecm ) .\nloss of collagen is associated with several clinical manifestations of aging skin , including wrinkles , sagging , and laxity ( jariashvili et al . , 2012 ; quan et al . , 2010 ; shuster et al .\n, 1975 ) . hence , increased expression and activity of mmps during aging can decrease the amount of collagen in the skin ( varani et al . , 2004 ) , diminish fibroblast collagen interactions , and reduce mechanical tension , explaining the wrinkling phenotype observed in aged skin ( varani et al . ,\nanother hypothesis for facial wrinkling is the enhanced elastase activity upon uvb stimuli , which is associated with a reduction in the elastic properties of the skin ( imokawa , 2009 ) .\nthe role of cellular senescence in promoting changes in the elastic tissue has not been addressed yet , but represents an important avenue for future clinical approaches .\nwhile it is still unclear which specific stimuli are responsible for inducing cellular senescence during aging , both intrinsic and extrinsic aging have been linked to the age related increase in the number of senescent cells in the skin .\nfor example , the hereditary disorders werner syndrome , xeroderma pigmentosum , and hutchinson  gilford progeria syndrome , which are due to defects in dna damage repair or nuclear organization , are associated with increased cellular senescence and accelerated age related phenotypes in the skin ( davis et al . , 2007 ; harada et al . , 1999 ; liu et al . ,\nextrinsic factors , such as x - rays , ultraviolet ( uv ) light , and cigarette smoke , also can induce cellular senescence as well as age related phenotypes in the skin ( shin et al . , 2012 ; velarde et al .\nuv light can induce photoaging via direct damage to ecm components , such as collagen and fibrillin fibers ( jariashvili et al .\nindeed , mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested to play a role in both intrinsic and extrinsic aging , and may potentially serve as a common link between the two ( krutmann and schroeder , 2009 ) .\nuv radiation induced photoaging of human skin is associated with large scale deletions in mitochondrial genomes ( mtdna ) ( berneburg et al . , 1997 ; birch machin et al . , 1998 ) .\nintra individual studies have revealed that the frequency of a 4,977 bp deletion , also defined as \n, is increased up to 10 fold in photoaged skin compared with sun protected skin ( berneburg et al . , 1997 ) .\nthe majority of these deletions are detectable in the dermis of human skin exposed to physiological doses of uva ( berneburg et al . , 2005 ) .\nuv radiation also induces this common deletion in cultured skin fibroblasts and decreases mitochondrial function ( berneburg et al . , 2005 ) . because mitochondrial damage and dysfunction induces cellular senescence in culture and in vivo ( passos et al . , 2006 ; velarde et al . ,\n2012 ) , and uv light also promotes mitochondrial damage and cellular senescence , it would be interesting to test whether the uv - induced common deletion contributes to skin aging through mitochondrial dysfunction associated senescence .\nthis process is classically divided into four distinct but overlapping phases ( singer and clark , 1999 ) : 1 ) hemostasis , 2 ) inflammation , 3 ) proliferation , and 4 ) remodeling . during the first two phases , platelets promote coagulation and begin an inflammatory cascade by secreting a variety of cytokines and chemokines to attract macrophages and neutrophils ( fuhrman et al . , 1991 ; kim et al . , 2008 ; shallo et al . , 2003 ) . before the inflammatory phase ends ,\nfibroblasts are recruited to the wound site and endothelial cells mature from progenitor cells to re establish vascularization ( chen et al . , 2008 ; postlethwaite et al .\nthe proliferative phase begins with the formation of a granulation tissue and collagen deposition , and the wound closes by epithelialization and the contraction of differentiated myofibroblasts , which are specialized contractile fibroblasts ( guo and dipietro , 2010 ) .\nthe final remodeling phase initiates when a stable ratio of collagen production and degradation is reached , and ends when the tissue acquires a mature organization and tensile strength after replacing transiently expressed collagen iii with collagen i ( madden and peacock , 1971 ; tomasek et al . , 2002 ) .\nrecent findings using mouse models show that senescent cells are transiently induced in the granulation tissue during the proliferative phase of wound healing and are efficiently removed during the transition to the remodeling phase ( demaria et al . , 2014 ) .\nwound contraction is important for wound closure during the proliferative phase ( midwood et al . , 2004 ) and proceeds through the formation of newly synthesized granulation tissue and the activation of contraction in myofibroblasts ( tomasek et al . , 2002 ) .\nthus , the presence of senescent cells within this window may be essential for proper wound healing .\nindeed , the elimination of senescent cells in young mice bearing cutaneous wounds leads to poor formation of granulation tissue and a dramatic reduction in the number of myofibroblasts , with consequent delayed wound closure ( demaria et al . ,\nnotably , this phenotype can be rescued in senescence - free mice by topical application of the sasp factor platelet derived growth factor aa ( pdgf - aa ) , which promotes the differentiation and maturation of myofibroblasts .\nsenescence free wounds were also more fibrotic during the remodeling phase , but topical pdgf - aa was unable to limit this excessive fibrosis .\nthese findings illustrate the complex and diverse roles played by senescent cells during wound healing , and suggest that other sasp factors in addition to pdgf - aa are important for optimal wound healing .\nas indicated above , another important contribution of senescent fibroblasts during tissue repair is to limit fibrosis , which is commonly observed in chronic wounds and is characterized by excessive collagen deposition ( telgenhoff and shroot , 2005 ) .\nseveral mmps , including mmp2 , mmp3 and mmp9 , are part of the sasp ( table 1 ) ( coppe et al . , 2010 ; coppe et al . , 2008 ) and can degrade excess collagen and maintain tissue homeostasis during wound healing ( jun and lau , 2010 ) . indeed , failure to induce senescence during wound\nhealing causes fibrosis in the skin and liver ( jun and lau , 2010 ; kim et al .\noverall , these results indicate that senescent cells can promote tissue repair through cell non autonomous mechanisms .\nthe irreversible growth arrest of senescent cells may restrict proliferation during wound healing as a means to protect against aberrant cell proliferation .\nthis cell autonomous effect of senescent cells is in keeping with a fundamental role for cellular senescence in tumor suppression ( campisi , 2001 ) .\ncells from mice lacking the p16 and p21 genes are incapable of undergoing cellular senescence and highly susceptible to skin carcinogenesis upon dmba/ tpa treatment due to their inability to arrest cell proliferation ( takeuchi et al . , 2010 ) .\nhence , the absence of cellular senescence may transform a wound into a hyperplastic or premalignant phenotype characterized by unregulated cell proliferation . because wound healing and cancer share several molecular and cellular events ( dvorak , 1986 ; feng et al . , 2010 )\n, senescent cells may play an essential role in promoting wound healing while preventing cancer initiation . while a lack of senescent cells impairs wound healing and can promote tumorigenesis ,\nfor example , chronic wounds are characterized by the persistent presence of senescent cells in the wound areas ( mendez et al . , 1998 ; vande berg and robson , 2003 ; vande berg et al . , 2005 ) .\nbecause chronic wounds fail to progress through the different stages of the wound healing process ( sen et al . , 2009 ) , an excessive number of senescent cells may restrict cell proliferation and disrupt paracrine signaling cascades , thereby retarding the ability of wounds to resolve after injury .\nmoreover , some of the sasp factors that are important for wound healing seem to also promote cancer progression through cell non autonomous mechanisms .\nfor example , certain mmps that are anti fibrotic in wounds can also promote tumor cell invasion during the progression of skin cancers ( woenne et al . , 2010 ) .\nthe complex role of senescent cells in the skin includes cell autonomous and non autonomous functions , which may be beneficial during wound healing but deleterious during aging ( figure 1 ) .\nwhat determines the phenotype of senescent cells and whether their effects on the tissue microenvironment are positive or negative ?\none hypothesis is that both the cell autonomous and non autonomous properties of senescent cells are highly dependent on age and time .\nfirst , the induction of an irreversible growth arrest might be an essential mechanism during wound healing that limits the number of highly proliferative cells , which are at risk for acquiring premalignant or malignant mutations .\nhowever , with time and age , this mechanism can exhaust the pool of proliferation competent stem or progenitor cells , which contribute to tissue turnover and regeneration .\nsecond , the slow accumulation of senescent cells in the skin due to increased number and/or defective clearance might create chronic inflammation and promote age associated skin pathologies , for example through the chronic production of mmps .\nthird , the sasp may be a malleable phenotype and change over time and with age .\nthus , harmful cytokines , chemokines and other inflammatory factors may be secreted by senescent cells only when they are persistently present in the skin .\nthe elimination of senescent cells is an attractive avenue for developing new interventions to treat age - related pathologies , and several laboratories are searching for small molecules that might be of potential interest for future clinical studies ( see ( dorr et al . , 2013 ) for an example ) . in the skin , the different roles of senescent cells in promoting both physiological and pathophysiological conditions are still in early phases of discovery .\nmore experiments need to be done to determine how senescent cells can tip the balance between efficient and chronic wound healing .\nit also remains to be proven whether presence of long - lived versus short - lived senescent cells plays a major contributory factor to this difference .\nthus , whether and how an anti - senescence approach will help maintain healthy skin awaits future experimentation .\nwhile the elimination of senescent cells might reduce age - related chronic inflammation and collagen degradation , this strategy could fail to restore youthful skin phenotypes that depend on adequate stem cell numbers .\nfinding ways to replenish these stem cells may be necessary in order to rescue age - related skin defects after the elimination of senescent cells .\nfurthermore , the continuous removal of senescent cells in the skin , particularly in the elderly , could impede wound healing and increase tissue scarring , which are of bigger concerns than having a youthful looking skin .\nhence , a better understanding of the complexity of the cell autonomous and non - autonomous functions of senescent cells , and the mechanisms that lead to their induction , will be essential in order to develop specific therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects to treat age - related skin phenotypes and pathologies ."}
{"id": 31, "text": "uterine fibroids ( leiomyomata or myomas ) are benign tumours of smooth muscle cells and fibrous connective tissue that develop within the walls of the uterus .\nthey are the most common gynaecological problem experienced by women , being of clinical significance in 2040% of women of childbearing age .\nthe true prevalence of uterine fibroids is unknown because the majority of these tumours are asymptomatic .\ntraditionally , symptomatic fibroids have been treated with myomectomy or hysterectomy performed by laparotomy [ 1 , 2 ] .   over the last few years ,\nundoubtedly the most significant therapeutic innovation has been the advent of uterine artery embolization ( uae ) as a form of nonsurgical management .\nembolization is also an excellent option for patients who will not accept blood transfusions and for those who are severely anaemic and require immediate intervention [ 3 , 4 ] .\nother absolute contraindications include comorbidities that may increase the risk for infectious complications ( e.g. , pelvic inflammatory disease or active genitourinary infection ) , the presence of an adnexal mass , and conditions that contraindicate any endovascular procedure ( e.g. , reduced immune status , severe coagulopathy , severe contrast medium allergy , or impaired renal function ) .\nthe desire to avoid a hysterectomy under any circumstances is also an absolute contraindication to uae .\nthere are no restrictions to the size and number of fibroids that can be treated with uae .\nanatomic exclusion criteria only include submucosal fibroids that may be effectively treated with hysteroscopic resection and pedunculated subserosal fibroids with a narrow stalk because of the potential risk and complications from infarction of the stalk and subsequent fibroid detachment from the uterus .\nthe aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of uterine fibroid embolization in patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids .\nall were consecutively selected from women presenting for evaluation for uterine artery embolisation at the department of obstetrics and gynecology of the university hospital split , croatia , between may 1999 and november 2006 . according to our existing protocol , patients were considered suitable for uae if they had single or multiple myomas causing symptoms ( namely , heavy menstrual bleeding and bulk related symptoms , which included pelvic pain and pressure effects ) sufficiently severe to warrant hysterectomy or myomectomy and wished to avoid surgery .\neligibility was not restricted by age , fibroid size , location , or previous surgery .\nalthough women desiring children were not excluded from the study , they were further informed of the uncertain effects of uae on conception or carrying to full term .\nexclusion criteria also included patients with pregnancy , active pelvic inflammatory disease , renal insufficiency , undiagnosed pelvic mass , or urogenital infection .\na detailed gynecologic history was obtained from each patient , followed by a detailed description of the procedure including a discussion of its potential risks .\nthis study was approved by the hospital ethic committee , with written informed consent obtained from each participant at the time of enrollment . during preprocedural testing , each patient underwent venous blood sampling ( complete blood count , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , prothrombin time ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the uterus .\nall the patients were admitted to the department of gynecology the day before the procedure .\nall procedures were performed by the same interventional radiologist according to the same procedure protocol . under local anesthesia , vascular access\nwas obtained with 5f catheter via the right femoral artery and aortic bifurcation to the contralateral internal iliac artery .\ndigital angiography was performed to identify the origin of the uterine artery , and thereafter , the left uterine artery was catheterized with coaxial 3f microcatheter .\nthe tip of the microcatheter was placed in the distal third of the left uterine artery , and 350500  m sized polyvinyl alcohol particles ( ivalon , nycomed , paris ) were injected until there was complete stasis of flow . after confirming the presence of a stagnant column of contrast in the left uterine artery , the right uterine artery was catheterized in similar fashion and embolized .\nall catheters were removed and groin pressure was applied for 10 to 15 minutes , thus completing the procedure .\nthe goal of the therapy was to occlude the uterine artery branches that supply only the fibroid tumors and spare normal myometrial vessels.the arteriograms obtained after embolization revealed complete occlusion of the branches supplying the fibroids .\nafter the procedure , patients were kept in hospital for 2448 hours for further observation hematoma formation at the arterial puncture site and pain control .\nall patients with successful procedures were evaluated at 3 , 6 , and 12 months after embolization with gynecologic examination , magnetic resonance imaging , and questionnaire .\nthey were asked whether their symptoms resolved completely , improved , remained unchanged , or deteriorated .\nsymptom change and patient satisfaction were classified as markedly improved , moderately improved , slightly improved , unchanged , and worse .   \ndescriptive statistics , including means and ranges , were calculated for dominant fibroid and uterine volumes , demographic and clinical characteristics .\ndifferences in dominant fibroid and uterine volumes before and after uae were analyzed with student 's paired t - test .\nthere were 157 patients included in the study , but bilateral uae was successful in 152 ( 96.8% ) cases .\nfive ( 3.2% ) procedures were technically unsuccessful , four because of malformed vessels and one of them had allergic reaction to contrast medium .\nall of the patients went home within the first week after the procedure ( range 16 days ) .\nthe majority of women went home the day after uae ( mean hospitalization was 1.4 days ) . \n\ntable 2 summarizes complications of the embolization . after the procedure , most patients experienced crampy pelvic pain , of variable intensity , which was well managed with the standard analgesia protocol ( narcotics and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ) . some of the participants had nausea , and only few of them had vomiting .\nall patients had an uneventful recovery and were able to return to normal activity within two weeks of embolization .\nrate of uterine regression and dominant fibroid volume determined by magnetic resonance scanning 3 , 6 , and 12 months after procedure is shown in table 3 .\nmedian uterine volume decreased by 38% , 57% , and 61% after 3 , 6 , and 12 months after embolotherapy , respectively .\ncomparison of the regression of preprocedural and final uterine volume revealed statistical significance ( p < 0.01 ) .\nmedian dominant fibroid volume decreased by 46% , 61% , and 66% after 3 , 6 , and 12 months from preprocedure values , respectively .\nthe quantum regression of pretreatment to final dominant fibroid volume also revealed statistical significance ( p < 0.01 ) . \n\nall women reported resumption of regular menses except five ( 3% ) with persisting amenorrhea .    comparing uae and surgery\nwomen stay in hospital for on average 6 days and then may take up to 3 months to recuperate . however , once the uterus is removed , there is no recurrence of fibroid - related symptoms .\nuae is a minimally invasive technique with a short - term complication rate , and the great majority of women remain in hospital overnight to enable appropriate pain management [ 5 , 6 ] .\npain usually peaks on the first day following the procedure , but occasionally on the second day , and rarely on the third day postprocedure .\npain syndromes lasting longer than 2 weeks are rare . the pain is probably due to the ischemia produced by the embolization procedure .\nstrong analgesics and , particularly , patient controlled analgesia ( during hospitalization ) are extremely helpful during this period [ 38 ] .\nwe believe that an overnight admission is desirable , but others have advocated embolization on an outpatient basis [ 38 ] .\npremature menopause has been documented in 1% to 2% of patients after uae and is believed to result from nontarget embolization of the ovaries via the collateral bed between the ovarian and the uterine arteries .\nthis is a risk that must be considered in a premenopausal woman who desires future fertility .\nall authors who have published a series of any size have reported essentially similar outcome statistics [ 913 ] .   \nin addition to two deaths from septic shock [ 14 , 15 ] , other three deaths following uae have thus far been reported , one from pulmonary embolism   and two from uncertain causes , in more than 100  000 procedures performed worldwide .\na relatively common complication of uae is vaginal expulsion of an infarcted fibroid , with a reported rate of up to 10% [ 9 , 13 , 17 ] .\nthis complication is more frequently seen in patients with submucosal fibroids or intramural fibroids with a submucosal component .\nthe infarcted fibroid is expelled spontaneously and no additional treatment is necessary [ 9 , 13 , 17 ] .  \neighty percent to 90% of patients embolized have reported significant improvements in menorrhagia , bulk - related symptoms , or both .\nreduction in overall uterine volume averages 50% at 3 months after embolization and 67% at six months after embolization .\nindividual myomas showed average volume reductions at 60% to 65% , with a significant number of myomas becoming no longer visible at follow - up study [ 317 ] .\nthere have been no reports of reduced fertility after occlusion of the uterine vessels . at the same time\nthere are numerous reports of successful pregnancies after uae .   in conclusion , after tens of thousands of successfully performed uae worldwide\nuae is a successful , minimal invasive treatment of myomas that preserves the uterus and requires shorter hospitalization and recovery times than surgery .\nthe complication rate is low , and the results are rapid and impressive . in the near future , embolization might replace conventional medical and surgical treatments of uterine fibroids .\nthe results of this study indicate that this procedure might be recommended as a primary treatment for young patients with fibroids who wish to preserve , or enhance , their fertility ."}
{"id": 32, "text": "   in the   development of antibody - mediated therapies targeted to human cancer cells , including cancer stem / progenitor cells , the extracellular domains of plasma membrane proteins specifically expressed on cancer cells are promising candidates for antigens against which to be immunized , but the high homology of amino acid sequences between human antigens and their homologues in animals to be immunized often hamper efficient antibody production because of immunological tolerance . in the case of cellular membrane proteins having only a single transmembrane domain , recombinant protein with the extracellular domain fused to the ig - fc domain has been used as immunogen in many cases to generate antibodies reactive with the extracellular region .\nhowever , in the case of plasma membrane proteins having multiple transmembrane domains , the three dimensional architecture of the protein outside the cell is expected to be composed of multiple extracellular domains , suggesting that construction of ig - fc fusion proteins for immunization would be difficult .    to obtain antibodies reactive to the native extracellular structure of such membrane proteins , immunization by injection of cultured cells expressing the antigen has been used . however , large numbers of cells ( typically \n\t\t\t\t 10 - 10 \n\t\t\t\t  cells per animal ) are usually needed to prepare for immunization and some modifications of the injected cells are required , for example , genes encoding immunomodulatory cytokines ( interleukin-4 , and others ) or costimulatory molecules are expressed together with the antigen to obtain higher titers . moreover , the cells expressing plasma membrane proteins having multiple transmembrane domains such as g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) are not always available for immunization .\ntherefore , development of a simple and successful protocol for immunization against human multi - pass membrane proteins is needed in antibody - mediated cancer research .    \ndendritic cells ( dcs ) are the most potent antigen presenting cells and robustly induce adaptive immunity mediated by t cells and b cells [ 4 , 5 ] .\nthe central role of dcs in immunity may explain why dc - mediated vaccines have been used for induction of cellular immunity against malignant tumor cells and infectious pathogens [ 68 ] .\nthe potency of dcs was demonstrated in previous studies to disrupt immunological tolerance against a tumor antigen and induce tumor antigen specific t cells .\nthe activation of cd4 t cells by dcs can exert helper functions to enhance efficient antibody production , production of high - affinity antibodies through somatic hypermutation , and class - switching of antibodies .\ndcs can also release exosomes containing intact antigen , which induces activation of antigen specific b cells antibody responses .\nthese observations strongly suggest that targeted expression of antigens in dcs to stimulate production of useful antibodies is a reasonable experimental approach ; however , such attempts have been limited [ 9 , 12 ] .    in this study , we focused on an immunization method using dcs expressing human tumor transmembrane antigens .\ndcs can efficiently present antigen to b cells and cd4   t cells because dcs express the antigen in intact form on the cell surface , to be recognized by antigen - reactive b cells , and in processed form in context with mhc molecules , to be specifically recognized by cd4 t cells .\nthe antigens used for immunization in this study were the human six transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1 ( steap1 ) , human steap4 , and the human prostate specific g - protein coupled receptor ( psgr ) [ 1317 ] .\nthese antigens possess multiple transmembrane domains ( 6 in steaps and 7 in psgr ) and high degree of homology with the corresponding mouse proteins ( 82% in steaps and 92% in psgr amino acid identity between human and mouse ) .\nthe complex native extracellular structures and their high degree of homology imply that production of antibodies against such membrane proteins may be difficult .\nhowever , in this study , we show that immunization using dcs efficiently induced antibody production against these membrane proteins in mice , which could be used for antibody - mediated immunological assays , including flow cytometry , immnuofluorescent staining , and western blotting .\n   balb / c mice ( 68 weeks old ) were purchased from sankyo labo service co. ( tokyo , japan ) .\nall animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the tokyo university of science .\n293 t cells were maintained in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum ( fcs ) .\nplate cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fcs , blasticidin ( 10 g / ml ) and puromycin ( 2 g / ml ) .\nlncap and du145 human prostate cancer cell lines were purchased from riken bioresource center ( tsukuba , japan ) and cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fcs .\nfor androgen stimulation , 5--dihydrotestosterone ( 5-dht ) was purchased from wako pure chemical industries ( osaka , japan ) .\nbriefly , bone marrow cells from tibias and femurs of balb / c mice were isolated , and 2  10 cells were plated in 10 cm bacterial dishes ( iwaki , chiba , japan ) and cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fcs and 20 ng / ml recombinant murine gm - csf ( peprotech , rocky hill , nj ) for 10 days . the suspension and loosely - adherent cells were collected as cd11bcd11c bm - dcs .\npcaggs , and pcaggs - ha containing cdna encoding hemagglutinin ( ha ) of human influenza a virus ( h1n1/pr8 ) was kindly provided by dr .\nthe cdna encoding human steaps ( steap1 and steap4 ) and human psgr were cloned from human spleen cdnas ( clontech , palo alto , ca ) using pcr and from human prostate rna ( clontech ) using rt - pcr , respectively .\npcr products were inserted into pgem t - easy vector ( promega , madison , wi ) .\nthe sequences of these cdna fragments were confirmed using abi prism 3100-avant dna sequencer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) . the cdnas were excised from pgem t - easy vector and inserted into either pmrx - ires - gfp or pcaggs .\nthe plasmids were propagated in e. coli ( dh5 ) and purified using a kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) for the following experimental procedures .  \nplate cells in 10 cm dishes were transfected with pmrx - hsteap1 ( hsteap4 , hpsgr)-ires - gfp using fugene 6 ( roche , indianapolis , in ) .\nthe collected culture supernatants were added to bm - dc cultures on days 4 and   8 and incubated with 5 g / ml polybrene ( sigma , st .\nthe medium was replaced by fresh medium after the overnight incubation . on day 10 , bm - dcs were collected and analyzed using facscalibur ( becton dickinson , san jose , ca ) to confirm gfp expression in bm - dcs .\nthe percentage of gfp positive cells in bm - dcs was routinely 15% and the phenotype of the gfp positive bm - dcs was as same as non - infected bm - dcs .   \nthe bm - dcs ( 2  10 cells / mouse ) were injected via tail vein or directly into the spleen of mice ( 0 weeks ) . at 2 weeks , 4 weeks , and 6 weeks , gene transduction with plasmids expressing antigens ( pcaggs - hsteap1 , -hsteap4 , and -hpsgr ; 5 g of plasmids / mouse ) was performed as a booster immunization using hydrodynamic delivery via the tail vein .\nthe sera at 8 weeks after dc injection were tested in following immunological assays .   \n293 t cells were transfected with pmrx - hsteap1-ires - gfp or pmrx - hsteap4-ires - gfp using lipofectamine ltx ( invitrogen , calsbad , ca ) . transfected 293 t cells , lncap cells , and du145 cells were detached from the dish by treatment with pbs/10 mm edta , collected , and resuspended in pbs/0.5% bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) . the immunized sera ( 1:100 diluted )\nafter washing , cells were incubated with pe conjugated goat antimouse igg ( beckman coulter , miami , fl ) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes .\nafter washing , stained cells were measured using facscalibur and data analysis was performed using the cellquest software ( becton dickinson ) . to determine igg1/2a ratio ,\nthe immunized sera are added to 293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - ha , followed by incubation on ice for 30 minutes .\nafter washing , cells were incubated with pe conjugated goat antimouse igg1 or igg2a ( beckman coulter ) .\nthe mean fluorescence intensity of the stained cells was determined and igg1/2a ratio was calculated .   \nthe proteins in cell lysates were separated by sds - page and transferred to immobilon membranes ( millipore , bedford , ma ) . the block - ace ( snow brand milk products , tokyo , japan ) solution was used for blocking the membranes , and membranes were then reacted with 1:500 diluted anti - steap1 serum for 1 hour at room temperature .\nafter washing , the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat antimouse igg+m ( biosource , camarillo , ca ) .\nspleen and bone marrow cells removed from an immunized mouse were fused with sp2/0 myeloma cells using peg .\nhybridoma cells producing anti - hsteap4 antibodies were cloned and established by limiting dilution and elisa screening .\nthe immunogloblin class of the antibodies produced from the hybridoma cells was determined using isostrip mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit ( roche ) .   \nlncap and transfected 293 t cells were seeded in eight - well chamber slides ( nalge - nunc , naperville , il ) . the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and , when required , permeabilized with 0.1% triton x-100 for 20 minutes at room temperature . after blocking , cells were incubated with 1:100 diluted serum or 4f2 ( anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody ) for 1 hour at room temperature .\nafter washing , cells were incubated with fitc conjugated goat antimouse igg ( jackson immunoresearch , west grove , pa ) for 1 hour at room temperature .\nthe stained cells were observed by confocal microscopy ( lsm510 , carl zeiss , jena , germany ) . in some cases ,\n293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - hsteap4 were cultured in regular medium for 30 minutes in the presence of 4f2 . after culturing ,\nmedium was removed and the cells were washed by pbs , fixed and stained with fitc conjugated antimouse igg .\nafter 3 booster injections of pcaggs - hsteap1 , sera from immunized mice were subjected to flow cytometry analysis to check antibody production against native extracellular structure of hsteap1 .\nthe sera from two of the five immunized mice reacted with 293 t cells expressing hsteap1 in a flow cytometry analysis ( figure 1(a ) ) . as negative controls , we also immunized mice with dc not expressing hsteap1 with booster injections , or the hydrodynamic injections only ( n = 3 for each group ) .\nno sera from these negative control groups stained 293 t cells expressing hsteap1 ( figure 1(a ) ) .\n. moreover , immunized sera clearly reacted with hsteap1 protein ( 34 kd ) in western blotting , but negative control sera did not ( figure 1(b ) ) .\nthe previous studies [ 13 , 17 ] demonstrate that human prostate cancer cell lines including lncap and du145 express hsteap1 endogenously .\nflow cytometry analysis showed that lncap cells were significantly stained with immunized serum , although du145 cells stained very faintly ( figure 1(c ) ) .\nthese results demonstrate that immunized sera could react with steap1 in human prostate cancer cells .\ncollectively , dc immunization can induce production of antibodies reactive to the native extracellular domain of hsteap1 .   \nthe frequency of antibody production against hsteap1 was relatively low ; therefore , we investigated better administration routes for dc immunization of mice .\nwe found that intrasplenic injection of dcs increased the frequency of antibody production relative to intravenous injections of dcs in ha and hsteap1 immunizations ( data not shown ) .\nthe immunized sera clearly reacted with 293 t cells expressing hsteap4 in flow cytometry ( figure 2(a ) ) .\nin contrast , booster immunizations ( by the hydrodynamics method ) without dc injection of three mice resulted in no staining in sera from two mice and weak staining in serum from one mouse , suggesting that dc immunization is critical for efficient antibody generation against hsteap4 , as well as hsteap1 ( figure 2(a ) ) .\nthe anti - hsteap1 serum did not react with 293 t cells expressing hsteap4 , and vice versa , demonstrating that there was no significant cross - reactivity between the hsteap1 and hsteap4 antibodies ( figure 2(b ) ) .    \na previous study showed that hsteap4 was expressed in lncap cells and increased upon androgen stimulation of the cells .\nthe hsteap4 immunized sera stained a small proportion ( ~1% ) of lncap cells and staining in these cells increased following androgen ( 5-dht ) treatment of the cells ( figure 2(c ) ) .\nthe restricted expression of hsteap4 in lncap cells was also confirmed using immunoflorescent staining ( figure 2(d ) ) . as a negative control , serum from mice immunized with dcs expressing ha as an irrelevant antigen was used , and only background staining was detected .   \nthree igg monoclonal antibodies ( one was igg1 ,  and two were igg2a ,  ) against hsteap4 were generated from an immunized mouse . in immunofluorescent staining , hsteap4 proteins were clearly detected in 293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - hsteap4 using these monoclonal antibodies as well as the immunized serum ( figure 2(e ) ) . in figure 2(e ) , 4f2 ( igg2a ) was used as representative .\nthe stained images demonstrated that hsteap4 was localized on the plasma membrane as well as intracellular structures , possibly endoplasmic reticulum , endosomes , and golgi apparatus , as described previously .\nimportantly , anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody ( 4f2 ) reacted with 293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - hsteap4 even without cell permeabilization treatment .\nthe stained images showed extracellular domain of steap4 proteins on plasma membrane was recognized by anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody .\nmoreover , anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody ( 4f2 ) was added to 293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - hsteap4 followed by immunofluorescent staining .\nfigure 2(f ) showed that anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody bound hsteap4 proteins on cell surfaces , suggesting that monoclonal antibody recognized the native extracellular domains of hsteap4 .\nthese results collectively suggest that antibodies specific for hsteap4 can be efficiently generated using dc mediated immunization .\nthese results prompted us to investigate whether dc immunization with hydrodynamics booster injections is applicable to other plasma membrane proteins .\npsgr belongs to the olfactory receptor family and is an orphan gpcr specifically expressed in prostate in both normal human tissues and prostate cancers .\nwe , thus , examined dc mediated antibody production against hpsgr . to test immunized serum for reactivity to native extracellular domains of hpsgr\n, a flow cytometry analysis using lncap cells , which endogenously express psgr , was conducted .\nthe lncap cells were positively stained with sera collected from immunized mice ( figure 3(a ) ) .\nhydrodynamic booster immunization alone failed to induce a significant antibody response against hpsgr in flow cytometry analysis ( data not shown ) . by immunofluorescent staining ,\npsgr expression was specifically detected on the cell surface of lncap cells ( figure 3(b ) ) .\nthe cell surface specific staining even without cell permieabilization treatment ( figure 3(b ) ) suggested anti - psgr serum in dc immunization reacted with extracelluar domain of psgr as well as flow cytometry analysis . taken together , these observations indicate that dc immunization is effective in inducing antibody production against psgr , in addition to steap family proteins .    to further characterize the antibody response , we determined igg1/2a ratio of anti - ha antibody .\nthe anti - ha specific immunological response evoked by dc immunization was shown to be th2 dominant because the ratio of igg1/2a in dc immunization was 8.75 at average and anti - ha igg1 was more abundant than igg2a ( figure 4 ) .\nthe ratio of igg1/2a in dc immunization was higher than hydrodynamics method ( average of 4.17 ) , although the difference was not statistically significant .\n   in this study , we investigated whether dcs as immunogens elicited antibody production against multiple - transmembrane proteins expressed in human prostate cancer cells .\nprevious studies demonstrated that immunization of mice with antigen - pulsed dcs resulted in efficient induction of antibody response .\naccordingly , our results underline the utility of dc immunization in the induction of antibody response against the external domains of membrane tumor antigens that might be useful for development of antibody mediated treatment of cancer diseases .    \nthe priming immunization with dcs was very effective , whereas plasmid - based immunization using hydrodynamic delivery alone was not sufficient to stimulate antibody generation , although hydrodynamics was an efficient method for booster immunizations ( figures 1 and 2 ) .\nmoreover , dcs exerted superior activity in antibody production relative to balb / c 3t3 fibroblasts in ha immunization ( data not shown ) .\nthese observations suggest that dcs possess strong priming activity to induce antibody production . in general , dcs\nare particularly known to induce th1 immune response because of their ability to initiate adaptive cellular immune response through production of high amounts of il-12 .\nhowever , the high igg1/2a ratio obtained following dc immunization indicated their potential effect in stimulation of antibody production as well .\nactually , because ha antigen is highly antigenic , hydrodynamic immunization significantly could induce anti - ha humoral responses , but igg1/2a ratio in dc immunization was higher than hydrodynamic immunization , suggesting that dc immunization can stimulate antibody response with th2 profile .\nthis strong immune response is particularly needed when using less immunogenic proteins such as steaps , which are highly homologous between human and mice .   \nthe steap family ( steap1 - 4 ) consists of a unique group of proteins : other proteins homologous to the steap family do not exist in higher mammals .\nthe steap family proteins share a high degree of homology in amino acid sequence , but there may be functional differences between steap1 and steap4 .\nsteap1 is largely lacking a cytoplasmic n - terminal tail homologous to bacterial and archaeal fno oxidoreductase , different from other steap proteins .\nin fact , coexpression of steap1 and steap4 may occur in some human normal and malignant tissues .\nan antibody -

{"id": 33, "text": "ectopic mineralization of soft connective tissues , particularly the cardiovascular system , is globally a major cause of morbidity and early mortality ( budoff et al . , 2007 ) .\nthe pathomechanisms leading to deposition of mineral complexes in these tissues are exceedingly complex , but significant insights have been gained from observations in a group of heritable ectopic mineralization disorders with defined gene defects ( li and uitto , 2013 ) .\nthe prototype of such conditions is pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( pxe ) , a multi - system disorder characterized by deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite in various connective tissues , with protean manifestations ( neldner , 1988 ; uitto et al . , 2013 ) .\nthe classic form of pxe is of late - onset and slowly progressing , and the major clinical problems relate to loss of eyesight and development of vascular complications ( neldner , 1988 ) .\nanother , characteristically more severe ectopic mineralization disorder is the generalized arterial calcification of infancy ( gaci ) , frequently diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound revealing vascular calcium deposits ( nitschke and rutsch , 2012a ; rutsch et al . , 2011 ) .\nthe newborns manifest with cardiovascular complications and many of these patients die within the first year of life , particularly if not receiving bisphosphonate treatment ( see below ) .\nfinally , a more recently described condition , arterial calcification due to cd73 deficiency ( acdc ) , manifests with calcification of arterial blood vessels particularly in the lower extremities and in periarticular ligaments and tendons , typically encountered in older individuals ( markello et al .\nthus , these clinical entities all manifest with varying degrees of mineralization of the arterial blood vessels , with evidence of phenotypic overlap ( le boulanger et al . , 2010 ; li et al .\nsignificant progress has recently been made in understanding the genetic basis of these heritable ectopic mineralization disorders ( table 1 ) .\nspecifically , the classic form of pxe is now known to be caused by loss - of - function mutations in the abcc6 gene encoding atp - binding cassette subfamily c , member 6 ( abcc6 ) , a putative transmembrane efflux transporter protein expressed primarily in the baso - lateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes and in the proximal tubules of the kidney ( belinsky and kruh , 1999 ;

jansen et al . , 2013 ) .\npxe is characterized by considerable both intra- and inter - familial heterogeneity , suggesting a role for genetic and environmental modifying factors .\nresearchers are now taking candidate gene and whole exome sequencing approaches to further dissect out the effects of putative modifier genes on clinical presentations in pxe ( dabisch - ruthe et al .\nin addition , there are reports that alterations in lipid metabolism and soft tissue calcification are closely related pathologies , and in this context , the role of abcc6 deficiency has been studied in lipoprotein and cholesterol homeostasis and in the development of atherosclerosis ( kuzaj et al . , 2014 ;\nseveral studies performed on pxe fibroblasts have demonstrated that mesenchymal cells , whether locally producing pro- and anti - calcifying factors or being involved in extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation , are involved in the mineralization of soft connective tissues ( boraldi et al . , 2014 ; ronchetti et al . , 2013\n) . however , it is unclear at the present if all mesenchymal cells in pxe lesions behave similarly , or whether their tissue - specific differentiation contributes to different susceptibility of connective tissues to mineralization .\nthe classic form of gaci is caused by mutations in the enpp1 gene which encodes ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase / phosphodiesterase 1 ( enpp1 ) , an enzyme facilitating hydrolysis of atp to amp and inorganic pyrophosphate ( ppi ) ( fig .\n1 ) . ppi is a powerful anti - mineralization factor , while inorganic phosphate ( pi ) serves as a pro - mineralization factor , and consequently , an appropriate ratio of ppi / pi is required to prevent spontaneous calcium phosphate precipitation under normal homeostasis . in the absence of enpp1 , this ratio is reduced and ectopic mineralization ensues .\ninterestingly , recent studies have demonstrated that some patients with pxe - like clinical features harbor mutations in the enpp1 gene while some patients clinically diagnosed as gaci have mutations in the abcc6 gene ( li et al .\ntherefore , these genotypic findings can explain the overlapping phenotypic features in some patients with ectopic mineralization disorders , pointing to shared pathomechanistic pathways leading to ectopic mineralization .\npatients with acdc with vascular calcification have been shown to harbor mutations in the nt5e gene which encodes cd73 , a membrane - bound ecto-5-nucleotidase that breaks down amp to adenosine and pi ( markello et al . , 2011 ; st hilaire et al . ,\ncd73 deficiency also increases the activity of tissue non - specific alkaline phosphatase ( tnap ) , accelerating conversion of ppi to pi .\nadenosine is a physiologic inhibitor of tnap , and reduced adenosine concentration results in tnap activation further facilitating the conversion of ppi to pi ( fig .\nin patients with pxe , the mutation database consists of ~300 distinct loss - of - function mutations in the abcc6 gene , including recurrent p.r1141x and g.del2329 mutations , which account for up to ~45% of all reported pathogenic alleles ( terry and hefferson , 2013 ) .\nit should be noted , however , that most of the findings have been reported in caucasian patients from the united states and europe , and for example , only recently , mutations in pxe patients of asian ancestry have appeared in press .\nspecifically , a recent study on chinese patients with pxe revealed mostly previously unreported mutations , and there is an apparent paucity of the recurrent p.r1141x and g.del2329 mutations ( jin et al . , 2015 ) .\nthis observation emphasizes the importance of studying patients of various ethnic backgrounds and different ancestries to allow development of allele - specific therapies for pxe .\nsignificant progress in understanding of the pathomechanistic details leading to ectopic mineralization in these disorders has been made by examination of animal models , particularly mice ( nitschke and rutsch , 2012b ) .\nspecifically , histopathologic examination of abcc6 knock - out mice ( abcc6 and abcc6 ) demonstrated the presence of mineral deposits in a number of tissues , including skin , eyes , and the cardiovascular system , similar to that in patients with pxe ( gorgels et al .\nin addition to genetically engineered knock - out mice , a number of inbred mouse strains , such as kk / hlj , have been demonstrated to harbor a specific mutation in the abcc6 gene which predisposes these animals to ectopic mineralization similar to the corresponding targeted knock - out mice ( berndt et al . , 2013 ; li et al . , 2012a ) .\nit should be noted that the degree of mineralization in these different mouse strains is highly variable even under standardized laboratory conditions , attesting to the presence of putative modifier genes ( li et al . , 2013a ) .\nin addition to the mouse models , a rat model through inactivation of abcc6 gene using zinc finger nuclease technology has recently been developed .\npreliminary data demonstrated mineralization of the dermal sheath of vibrissae of the homozygous mutant rat , similar to findings in abcc6 knock - out mice ( li et al . ,\nunpublished ) . another animal model for pxe consists of a zebrafish which has an orthologous abcc6a gene .\nknock - down of the abcc6a gene in 14 cell stage embryos by a morpholino , a stable antisense nucleotide eliciting suppression of expression of the targeted gene , results in profound phenotype consisting of pericardiac edema , stunted and curved tail ( li et al . , 2010 ) .\nthis phenotype can be readily rescued by concomitant injection of human or mouse abcc6 mrna together with the morpholino , attesting to the specificity of the abcc6a phenotype .\nthis model has provided a system to assess the pathogenicity of missense mutations in the human abcc6 gene by testing whether such mutant mrnas do or do not rescue the phenotype ( jin et al .\nthe missense mutation is deemed to be pathogenic , especially when combined with bioinformatics analysis .\nin addition to the morpholino - mediated abcc6a knock - down system , a zebrafish grt mutant was recently identified in a forward genetic screen , with a p.l1429r mutation in the abcc6a gene ( mackay et al . , 2015 ) .\nin contrast to morpholino - injected embryos with early lethality , the grt mutant fish survived for at least one year .\nboth heterozygous and homozygous mutant fish show signs of excessive mineralization in the craniofacial region and axial skeleton , and infrequently also in the skin .\nin addition , abcc6a was found to be strongly expressed at the sites of mineralization rather than in the liver , as it is in human and mice .\ntherefore , the grt phenotype does not fully recapitulate that of humans with pxe due to bi - allelic mutations in the abcc6 gene .\na number of animal models , particularly targeted and spontaneous mutant mice , have also been identified and characterized to recapitulate the features of gaci caused by enpp1 mutations .\n tip toe walking ( enpp1/enpp1 ) was first described as a spontaneous mutant mouse harboring a p.g568x nonsense mutation in the enpp1 gene ( okawa et al . , 1998 ) .\nthese mice exhibit accelerated bone formation , ossification of the spinal ligaments and ectopic mineralization of the aortic medial layer at the level of the internal elastic lamina .\nenpp1 knock - out mice exhibit abnormalities similar to those in  tip toe walking  mice ( sali et al . , 1999 ) . another enpp1 mutant mouse ( enpp1 ) , with a p.c397s missense mutation , has been characterized by low bone mineral density , crystal - related arthropathy and vascular calcification ( babij et al . , 2009 ) . a spontaneous mutant mouse with similar phenotype ( enpp1 )\nthese mice were shown to harbor a splice - site mutation c.259 + 1g > t in enpp1 gene ( takabayashi et al . , 2014 ) .\na mutant mouse with a missense mutation ( p.v246d ) in the enpp1 gene was recently identified at the jackson laboratory as a result of enu treatment ( li et al . , 2013b ) .\nthese mice demonstrated stiff posture , abnormalities in the front legs and stiffening of the joints ; hence , this mutation was named \nthe lack of enpp1 enzymatic activity in asj homozygous mice results in reduced ppi levels in the plasma , accompanied by extensive mineralization of a number of tissues , including arterial blood vessels and the dermal sheath of vibrissae .\nanother mutant mouse , asj-2j , was also identified at the jackson laboratory with a phenotypic gait due to periarticular mineral deposits .\nthis mouse was noted by histology to have extensive mineralization of the dermal sheath of vibrissae as well as arterial blood vessels .\nthe asj-2j mice were shown to be allelic to asj mice by complementation studies , and these mice harbor of a large 40,035 bp deletion spanning from intron 1 to the 3-untranslated region of the enpp1 gene , coupled with a 74 bp insertion , thus completely eliminating functional gene in these mice ( li et al . , 2014a ) .\nthus , these targeted and spontaneous mutant mice display features of gaci , and can serve as a platform to explore treatment of this ectopic mineralization disorder .\nthis mouse ( nt5e ) , developed by ablation of the nt5e gene ( castrop et al . , 2004 ) , showed stiffening of the joints , and micro ct revealed distinct changes in the thoracic skeletal structure with profound mineralization of the costochondral junctions ( li et al . , 2014b ) .\nmineralization was also noted in juxta - articular joint - capsules as well as ligaments adjacent to the bony structures , features in patients with acdc .\nno evidence of vascular mineralization was noted , indicating that the nt5e knock - out mice recapitulate some , but not all , features of acdc . there was a markedly reduced ppi / pi ratio in the plasma , attesting to the presence of a complex promineralization/ anti - mineralization network , characteristic to ectopic mineralization disorders , particularly in this case in acdc .\nthe metabolic hypothesis concerning pxe postulates that the absence of functional abcc6 activity , primarily in the liver , results in deficiency of circulating factor(s ) that are physiologically required to prevent aberrant mineralization under normal calcium and phosphate homeostatic conditions ( jiang and uitto , 2006 ) .\nhowever , the physiological role of abcc6 protein is currently unknown , and in particular , the identity of the factor(s ) being transported in vivo has long remained a mystery .\nrecently , using cultured cells , abcc6 was found to mediate the cellular release of atp which is rapidly converted extracellularly into amp and ppi ( jansen et al . , 2014 ; jansen et al . , 2013 ) .\noutside hepatocytes , but still within the liver vasculature , released atp is converted into amp and ppi , revealing an unanticipated role of the liver in systemic ppi homeostasis .\nthese findings raised the question whether atp is the physiologic substrate of abcc6 , however , transport of atp outside of the cells has not been demonstrated so far .\nabcc6 , enpp1 , and nt5e , respectively , are all part of the pathway that involves generation of ppi and pi from atp ( fig .\n1 ) . the unifying feature in these patients is reduction in the plasma ppi concentration resulting in reduced ppi / pi ratio .\nsince ppi is a powerful anti - mineralization factor and the primary deficiency in enpp1 or cd73 activity results in depletion of the ppi pool , it appears that these two conditions are pathomechanistically related .\nfurthermore , in the absence of functional abcc6 , the release of atp to the extracellular milieu is reduced , potentially lowering the extracellular pool of atp .\nin such situation , less atp is available as a substrate for enpp1 , again resulting in reduced ppi plasma concentration ( fig .\n1 ) . in support of this hypothesis are recent demonstrations that ppi levels in the plasma of patients with pxe are reduced leading to lower ppi / pi ratio ( jansen et al . , 2014 ; jansen et al . ,\nthus , all three ectopic mineralization disorders , pxe , gaci and acdc , with overlapping phenotypic features , share the deficiency in the same metabolic pathway .\nthe phenotypic differences in these conditions may reflect the specific additional roles of the mutated genes when combined with modifying genetic factors and the environmental influences .\nnevertheless , understanding the pathomechanistic alterations in these diseases may provide targets for pharmacologic modulation of the disease .\nno specific treatment modality is currently available for prevention of systemic ectopic mineralization in pxe or gaci .\nremarkable success has been achieved , however , in the treatment of ocular complications in pxe using vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists ( lucentis and avastin ) which prevent neovascularization and preserve the vision ( myung et al . , 2010 ; verbraak , 2010 ) .\nin fact , this approach has markedly reduced the incidence of the most severe complication of pxe , i.e. , loss of vision , and has changed the focus of the disease to be largely on the skin and arterial vasculature . the first attempts to develop treatment for systemic mineralization in pxe focused on modifications of the mineral content of the diet .\npreclinical animal studies , using abcc6 knock - out mice as a platform , demonstrated that a diet with elevated phosphorus and reduced magnesium content ( so - called  acceleration diet  ) enhanced the ectopic mineralization in this model , while conversely , increasing the magnesium content in the mouse diet by 5-fold completely abolished ectopic mineralization ( jiang and uitto , 2012 ; larusso et al . , 2009 ) .\nfurthermore , recent studies have demonstrated that feeding of pregnant mice with the  acceleration diet  increases the mineralization of the newborn pups , with apparent relevance to gaci characterized by ectopic mineralization of blood vessels during fetal development ( li et al . , 2015b ) .\nbased on the observations of the critical role of magnesium in modifying the degree of mineralization , a double - blinded placebo - controlled clinical trial with diet fortified with magnesium has been initiated in patients with pxe ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01525875 ) .\nconsidering the evidence in support of the notion that reduced ppi concentration is a critical factor allowing ectopic mineralization to ensue , a suggestion has been made that introduction of ppi would be helpful in prevention of the mineralization processes ( o'neill et al .\nunfortunately , inorganic pyrophosphate is extremely labile and has a short half - life due to hydrolysis of the molecule .\nthis has raised the possibility to use stable , non - hydrolysable pyrophosphate analogs , bisphosphonates , for treatment of ectopic mineralization disorders .\nin fact , bisphosphonates have been used for either prenatal or perinatal treatment of gaci patients , but careful examination of the literature reveals varying results , some studies showing apparent improvement , while in others very little , if any , effect is found ( edouard et al . , 2011 ; galletti et al . , 2011 ;\nfurthermore , bisphosphonate administration has resulted in severe toxicity after protracted therapy ( otero et al . ,\n2013 ) . to explore the efficacy of bisphosphonates for treatment of ectopic mineralization disorders , recent studies have used abcc6 knock - out and asj mice as a model of pxe and gaci , respectively ( li et al .\nin principle , bisphosphonates have two properties on mineralization : ( i ) anti - mineralization activity which is derived from incorporation of the bisphosphonate into calcium phosphate crystals preventing their growth , and ( ii ) anti - osteoclastic activity which prevents bone resorption .\nthe latter activity is the basis for extensive use of bisphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis and other disorders affecting bone , including paget s disease , bone metastases , osteogenesis imperfecta and multiple myeloma ( uludag , 2002 ) .\nbisphosphonates , etidronate or alendronate , demonstrated that they were able to prevent ectopic mineralization in abcc6 or asj mice when administered either by mouth at relatively high concentrations or by subcutaneous administration in 100-times lower concentration ( li et al .\ninterestingly , the microarchitecture of the bones , which is severely perturbed in the asj mice , was corrected with etidronate .\nthus , there is a dual beneficial effect , i.e. , inhibition of soft tissue mineralization and improvement in bone microarchitecture , which was achieved by bisphosphonate administration .\nit should be noted , that these beneficial effects were achieved with relatively high concentrations of bisphosphonates , and further long - term toxicity studies are required before this approach should be tested in clinical trials in humans , particularly concerning potential side effects .\nthe potential treatment of pxe has also recently been explored by a number of molecular and cell - based strategies .\nfor example , the potential correction of nonsense mutations in the abcc6 gene by read - through mechanism facilitated by ptc124 , a non - aminoglycoside nonsense mutation suppressor , has been tested ( zhou et al . , 2013 ) .\npreliminary studies demonstrated that ptc124 enhances read - through of stop codon mutations in this gene in cell culture systems .\nwith respect to missense mutations with preserved transport activity but with improper plasma membrane localization of the protein , a chemical chaperone , 4-phenylbutyrate ( 4-pba ) , a drug approved for clinical use for other indications , has been tested in pxe mice .\nthe results revealed restoration of the plasma membrane localization of abcc6 in mouse hepatocytes in a limited number of specific mutations , suggesting that allele - specific therapy may be useful for selected patients with pxe and gaci , i.e. , those carrying missense mutations in their abcc6 gene ( le saux et al .\nfurthermore , transplantation of cells with hepatoblastic lineage differentiation , either representing a hepatoblast cell line or differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells ( ipscs ) , has demonstrated homing of these cells to the liver and has resulted in abcc6 protein expression in abcc6 knock - out mice ( jiang et al .\nsignificant progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis and pathomechanistic pathways involved in heritable ectopic mineralization disorders , as exemplified by pxe , gaci and acdc .\nthis progress has now identified pathways that can potentially serve as pharmacologic targets towards treatment of these currently intractable disorders .\nwhile these heritable disorders are rare , study of these conditions has allowed significant insights into complex , much more common disorders .\nfor example , utilization of mouse models of pxe , the level of hepatic expression of abcc6 has been shown to determine the severity of calcification and the infarct size after cardiac injury , contribute to arterial calcification , and participate in development of chronic kidney disease ( brampton et al . , 2014 ;\nlau et al . , 2014 ; mungrue et al . , 2011 ; prunier et al\nin that sense , the abcc6 transporter system can be considered as a paradigm for extending the knowledge from rare heritable diseases to complex disorders ( de vilder et al . , 2015 ) . finally ,\ndevelopment of novel pharmacologic interventions for rare heritable ectopic mineralization disorders , such as pxe , may be applicable to disorders , such as arteriosclerosis , a much more common condition in general populations , with a major burden to the global healthcare systems ."}
{"id": 34, "text": "despite decades of intensive research , cancer remains one of the most dangerous diseases in the developed world . in the united states alone ,\nthe incidence of various tumors and cancers is increasing at an alarming rate despite great achievements and decades of intensive , labor - consuming and expensive research . according to the national cancer institute estimates , slightly less than one - in - two men and a little more than one - in - three women in the u.s .\nalthough some success in surgical removal of primary tumors has been achieved , it is difficult to terminate the spread of metastatic cancer or to predict which early stage cancers are potentially metastatic .\ntherefore , there has been an intense interest in methods for identifying patients with higher recurrence risk . among the many ,\nprocathepsin d ( pcd ) is one of the independent prognostic factors that has gained considerable attention in recent years[18 ] .\nthe first study showing increased levels of cathepsin d ( cd ; processed form of pcd ) in several human neoplastic tissues was reported in the mid - eighties .\nsubsequent clinical studies demonstrated a correlation between pcd / cd levels and tumor size , tumor grade , tumor aggressiveness , incidence of metastasis , prognosis and a degree of chemoresistance in a variety of solid tumors[1214 ] .\nvarious studies employing several different approaches such as immunohistochemistry , in situ hybridization , cytosolic assay , northern and western blot analyses indicated that in most breast cancer tumors , pcd was overexpressed at least 2-to-50 fold .\nthe mitogenic effect of secreted pcd on breast cancer cells was first demonstrated by vignon et al .. subsequent additional studies showed that secreted pcd functioned as an autocrine growth factor in breast , prostrate , ovarian and lung cancer cells .\nin contrast , decreased expression of pcd by antisense gene transfer , rna interference or ribozymesresulted in decreased growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo .\nconsistent with this , tumor growth was also inhibited by utilization of anti - pcd antibodies in vivo and in vitro .\nin addition to this autocrine mitogenic effect , pcd is also implicated in paracrine communication with surrounding cells .\nberchem 's group demonstrated that pcd not only stimulated parent cancer cell proliferation but also tumor angiogenesis by a paracrine mechanism .\n. showed that pcd secreted from cancer cells possibly stimulated proliferation , survival , motility and invasive potential of surrounding fibroblasts by activation of the ras - mapk pathway indicating pcd 's role in paracrine communication . supporting these data\n, we demonstrated substantial secretion of cytokines especially il-4 , il-8 , il-10 , il-13 and mip-1b from both cancer cell lines and fibroblasts after addition of pcd which promoted the growth of both cell types .\ndirect association of secreted pcd with cancer invasion and metastasis has also been demonstrated by independent studies .\nthe first direct role of pcd in cancer metastasis was demonstrated in rat tumor cells where over - expressed pcd increased the metastatic potential of these cells .\nalternatively , downregulation of pcd expression by antisense gene inhibited lung metastasis of breast cancer cells but had no effect on invasion in vitro .\nhowever , tedone et al . showed that downregulation of pcd expression resulted in decreased invasion of mcf-7 cells in vitro .\nin addition , sivaparvathi et al . observed that anti - cd antibodies inhibited glioblastoma cell invasion through matrigel .\nconsistent with this data , our studies with decreased pcd secretion from breast and lung cancer cells directly influenced their ability to cross the matrigel membrane in vitro and in vivo .\nberchem et al demonstrated that secreted pcd stimulated tumor angiogenesis in tumor xenograft in athymice nude mice . supporting this , we recently observed several regulators of angiogenesis being differentially expressed in breast cancer cells treated with the activation peptide of pcd .\nthese studies strongly suggest that pcd may also be involved in angiogenesis during cancer progression . since the control of angiogenesis is a balance between positive and negative angiogenic factors , additional experiments are required to define the exact role of pcd in angiogenesis . supporting the diverse functions of pcd in cancer progression , microarray analysis of activation peptide ( ap ) treated breast cancer cells showed differential expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression , cell survival , cell adhesion , angiogenesis , invasion and metastasis .\nin contrast , decreased expression of these genes in response to ablated pcd using rna interference further confirmed the role of pcd in cancer progression . despite extensive documentation regarding pcd 's role in cancer progression ,\nindependent studies have shown that the secreted pcd binds to the surface of the breast cancer cells through a receptor with possible downstream signalling . based on these observations , we proposed a model for the mechanism of pcd action in which overexpressed pcd escapes its normal targeting pathway and is secreted from the cancer cells .\nthe secreted pcd interacts via its activation peptide to an unidentified cell surface receptor present on its surrounding cells .\nthis interaction releases a signal resulting in differential expression of cancer promoting genes that includes various cytokines that stimulate tumor growth .\ncollectively , these studies not only define pcd as a tumor marker of cancer progression but also underlie pcd as a potential target for cancer therapy if selective inhibition of pcd interaction with a cellular receptor could be achieved .\ncurrent diagnostic assays for cancers are antigen - based and rely on the detection of circulating proteins that are associated within a particular cancer . these assays are based on the expression , synthesis and release of specific proteins by tumor cells either by active secretion or shedding or as a consequence of cell death ( either by necrosis , apoptosis , or autophagy ) .\nregardless , these antigenic proteins must  escape  the primary site of disease , saturate the antigen - processing capacity of the individual 's immune components , gain access to the circulation , and reach a sufficient steady - state concentration to be detected by enzyme- or radiolabel - based immunoassays .\nthus , despite the fact that certain specific antigenic epitopes exhibit common recognition sites among patients with the same tumor types , the use of these antigen - based cancer assays has not been widely accepted into clinical practice and many individual countries differ in the use of these potential diagnostic factors .\nresearch performed in both our laboratory and others has demonstrated the presence of anti - pcd autoantibodies .\nas these antibodies are specific to pcd only and do not recognize mature cd , they represent an ideal target for comparison of the pcd presence and cancer progression .\nas pcd / cd is supposed to be contained inside the cells , it is possible that the body will react to their presence by formation of specific autoantibodies .\nsubsequently , their level might correlate with the stage of breast , lung and prostate cancer , corresponding with the increased number of pcd - releasing cancer cells and thus offer a cost - effective , non - invasive screening test . as the release of pcd was observed in numerous cancer types[1521 ] , one can assume that the specific autoantibodies will also be formed in additional types of cancer . in our preliminary experiments\n, we found the elevated levels of anti - pcd autoantibodies in lung , prostate and stomach cancer .\nwe assume that the amount of the appcd / pcd in the patient 's serum will change with the progress of the cancer disease , in correlation with the increased number of pcd - releasing cancer cells .\nsince the levels of autoantibodies corresponded with stages of breast cancer , it is clear that there is a high clinical potential in evaluation of specific anti - pcd autoantibodies as biological marker .\nin past decades , more and more interest was focused on the possible additional roles of pcd 's .\nindependent studies showed the potential role of pcd in wound healing , tissue remodeling and programmed cell death - apoptosis .\nepidermis is the barrier between the body and external environment which is constantly exposed to various forms of environmental and physical stresses .\nkeratinocytes are the basic elemental cells that form the epidermis and play a critical role in normal regeneration and healing processes .\nskin healing is dependent upon several processes that involve inflammation , protein synthesis , matrix deposition , migration and subsequent proliferation of keratinocytes .\nnumerous proteins that include proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases , interstitial collagenase and cathepsin b are secreted from keratinocytes . during the wound healing process\n, these proteolytic enzymes may play a role in motility of keratinocytes by remodeling of extracellular matrix for migration of keratinocytes to peripheral layers of epidermis .\nindeed , the study conducted by katz and taichmann , focusing on the proteins secreted by cultured human epidermal keratinocytes , showed cd being one of the secreted proteins . in skin , increased levels of the mature form of cd was shown in basal keratinocytes during hyperproliferative skin disorders such as psoriasis .\nin addition , the involvement of different isoforms of cd in the epidermal cell differentiation was suggested .\nthe presence of pcd was shown in the spinous layer and the active forms were present in stratum corneum , where they played a role in epidermal desquamation .\nalthough the role of cd in epidermal differentiation has been defined , the presence of pcd at different stages of differentiation is still unclear .\nmoreover , most of these studies were performed using cell lysates where all the isoforms are present , thus making clear distinction of the roles played by individual isoforms virtually impossible . to better define the role of pcd in differentiation , our recent study demonstrated active secretion of pcd by human keratinocytes cell line hacat .\nsubsequent experiments showed that exogenous addition of purified pcd enhanced the proliferation of hacat cells .\nthis proliferative effect of pcd was inhibited by monoclonal antibody against the activation peptide of pcd . supporting this , treatment of hacat cells with pcd or\nits activation peptide resulted in the secretion of a set of cytokines that promoted the growth of cells in a paracrine manner .\nthe role of secreted pcd and its mechanism of action were further studied in a scratch wound model . while the presence of pcd and its activation peptide enhanced the regeneration of monolayer , this effect was reversed by the addition of anti - ap antibody .\nfinally , expression and secretion of pcd was upregulated in hacat cells exposed to various stress conditions .\ntaken together , our results strongly suggest that the secretion of pcd is not only linked to cancer cells but also plays an essential role in the normal physiological conditions such as wound healing and tissue remodeling .\nwhile many functions of pcd in the physiological and pathological processes could be attributed to its enzymatic activity , this review clearly establishes that some of the functions of pcd are independent of its protease activity and rely on the ability of pcd to interact with other important molecules .\ntherefore , it seems inevitable that searching for pcd - interacting partners should be conducted to explore the mechanism of pcd actions ."}

limited environments , such as sewage sludges , polluted waters , and organically enriched soils .\npreviously , wada   reported that an unidentified spore - forming filamentous fungus colonized rice straws in submerged rice field soil where the anaerobic condition was sufficient for sulfate reducing .\nsaito et al .   showed that cellulose filter papers or cellophane films incorporated into submerged rice field soil were transiently colonized by fungal hyphae ten days after flooding .\nrecently , it has been suggested that fusarium oxysporum likely acquires energy for growth by denitrification   and by ammonia fermentation .\nfungal denitrification occurs in an o2 limited environment in which n2o is generated as a final denitrified product because of the lack of n2o reductase to generate n2 from n2o . on the other hand ,\nfungal ammonia fermentation occurs in an anaerobic environment in which no3 is reduced to nh4 and ethanol is oxidized to acetate .\nthe fungal denitrification and ammonia fermentation in response to hypoxic conditions are considered to extensively distribute among many fungi .\nthese findings show the possibility that filamentous fungi capable of growth in the absence of oxygen are likely distributed in anaerobic environments in greater numbers than expected .\nthe author , therefore , attempted to isolate anaerobic filamentous fungi living in rice soils by applying the method of hungate 's roll - tube anaerobic technique   generally used in colonization of anaerobic prokaryotic cells . here , the author reports the isolation and characterization of a novel facultative anaerobic fungus from japanese rice field soil .\n\n thermomyces lanuginosus nbrc 9738 purchased from the national institute of technology and evaluation was used for comparison with rb-1 .\nmartin 's medium   reduced with 0.03% cysteine hydrochloride was used for anaerobic fungal isolation from rice field soil . for usual cultivation , basal medium\n( 0.1% kh2po4 , 0.05% mgso4 7h2o , 0.5% peptone , 0.1% yeast extract , and 1% glucose , ( ph 7.0 ) ) was used . for testing utilization of substrates , 1% glucose in the basal medium\nwas substituted by the indicated substrates . for examining cultural and morphological characteristics , potato dextrose agar ( pda : nissui ) was used . for anaerobic cultivation , media containing 0.0001% resazurine were prepared under an oxygen - free n2 atmosphere for visual check of reducing conditions . before inoculation , the media were reduced by aseptically adding cysteine hydrochloride ( adjusted to ph 7.0 ) to a final concentration of 0.03% .\nthe tubes , vessels , and flasks used were closed with cotton plugs for aerobic cultivation and butyl rubber stoppers for anaerobic cultivation .\nif needed , suitable amounts of caco3 were added to the medium as a ph stabilizer to maintain the culture ph at 5.65.8 .\nisolation of the fungus used in this study was essentially carried out in accordance with the hungate roll tube technique . all procedures except soil sampling and aerobic incubation on pda during the final step of isolation\nsoil was collected from 010  cm depth from the rice field at kanagi farm of the teaching and research center for biocoexistence at hirosaki university , aomori , japan , in april 2004 .\nsome of the soil properties were as follows : ph ( h2o ) , 6.0 ; water content , 38.9% .\nthe soil sample was serially diluted in a 0.03% cysteine hydrochloride solution ( ph 7.0 ) and transferred to agar - solidified medium ( reduced with 0.03% cysteine hydrochloride ) role tubes , which were then incubated at 25c in a vertical position .\nafter two months of incubation , the mycelium of a fungal colony formed on the agar was transferred to the same anaerobic fresh slant medium and incubated at 25c .\nafter two repetitions of the procedure , the mycelium developed on the anaerobic slant was transferred to a pda plate and aerobically incubated at 25c . a single spore isolate from the pda plate culture\nthe cultures of rb-1 were maintained on pda slants prepared in 25  ml tubes under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .\nthe rb-1 strain has been deposited in the japan collection of microorganisms ( jcm ) as jcm13780 . for morphological observations and determination of cultural characteristics ,\nthe isolate was cultured aerobically or anaerobically on pda plates at 25c or on pda thinly spread on a glass slide at 25c ( slide culture ) .\nanaeropack ( mitsubishi gas chemicals co. , inc . ) was used for generating anaerobic atmosphere . after staining with lactophenol cotton blue ,\nthe morphology of the isolate was observed under differential interference contrast with the use of an olympus microscope ( bx50f4 ) or under phase contrast with an olympus microscope ( mx50 ) . for macroscopic observations , a stereomicroscope ( olympus szh10 )\nnearly full - length small subunit ( ssu ) rdna ( 1,760  bp ) was pcr - amplified using the primer pair e21f ( 5-atctggttgatcctgccagt-3 ) and e1778r ( 5-aatgatccttccgcaggttc-3 ) .\nfor amplification of the internal transcribed spacer ( its ) region and the 5 end of large subunit ( lsu ) rdna including the d1-d2 domains ( its - lsu rdna ) ( 1,259  bp ) , a primer set its5 ( 5-ggaagtaaaagtcgtaacaagg-3 )   and nl4 ( 5-ggtccgtgtttcaagacgg-3 )   was used .\nthe pcr products were directly sequenced using the thermo sequenase cy5.5 dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and the seq 4.4 personal sequencing system ( amersham ) .\nthe sequences of ssu rdna and its - lsu rdna of the isolate are deposited in the ddbj / genbank / embl databases under the accession numbers ab246879 and ab517730 , respectively .\nthe determined sequences and those of relatively closely related taxa to the isolate retrieved from the ddbj / genbank / embl databases by searching with blast program were aligned using the clustal w program .\nthe evolutionary distances between the sequences were calculated using kimura 's two - parameter model , and the phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor - joining method   using the mega 4.0   computer program .\nbootstrap analyses were conducted to assess the confidence limits of the branching by 1000 heuristic replicates .\nthe temperature and ph profiles of the isolate were determined by measuring the diameters of the colonies developed under aerobic conditions .\nthe ph profile was tested on the basal medium plate at a ph range from 2.0 to 9.5 .\nfor testing available substrates for fermentation , autoclaved or filter - sterilized substrates were added to 10  ml of basal medium instead of glucose in culture tubes , and the mycelium from the pda slant was inoculated into the medium .\nincubations were carried out at 30c for up to 3 months under aerobic or anaerobic conditions without shaking .\ntime course of growth by the isolate under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was determined using 500  ml erlenmeyer flasks with 100  ml of basal medium inoculated with the equivalent of 1.5  mg ( dry weight ) mycelium previously grown aerobically in 10  ml basal medium at 30c for 10 days .\nafter inoculation , the flasks were incubated at 30c in a reciprocal shaker operating at 100  rpm .\nsamples were collected at various intervals by filtration through nitrocellulose filters and were measured after drying to a constant weight at 105c ; the resulting filtrates were used to determine the residual glucose and fermentation products .\ngrowth yields of the isolate on aerobic and anaerobic medium were determined using 125  ml serum bottles with 100  ml of basal medium inoculated with a trace amount ( < 0.1  mg ) of mycelium from the pda slant picked with a needle tip . after static incubation at 30c for 10 days , cultures underwent the same analytical procedures for growth analysis as described above .\ngrowth ability of the isolate under anaerobic conditions was confirmed by a successive transfer experiment as described by gleason and gordon .\nthe mycelium of the isolate grown on the pda slant was inoculated into 100  ml anaerobic basal medium prepared in a 125  ml serum bottle .\nthe culture bottle was incubated at 30c and a small part of the mycelium grown in the medium was transferred every five days into the same medium .\nexposure of mycelium to an atmospheric condition was avoided as possible with an immediate transfer to the next fresh medium .\nethanol was analyzed in a gas chromatograph ( shimadzu gc8a ) equipped with an fid detector and a porapaq n column ( waters ) .\norganic acids were measured by using hplc ( organic acid analysis system , shimadzu ) equipped with an ion exclusion column ( shim - pack scr-101h ) and detected by a post - column ph - buffered electroconductivity detection method   according to the manufacturer 's instructions .\ngas samples were determined by gas chromatography ( shimadzu gc8a ) equipped with a tcd detector and a wg-100 column ( gl sciences ) .\nthe strain designated rb-1 was a filamentous fungus isolated from japanese rice field soil that could grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .\nafter six weeks of aerobic incubation at 25c on a pda plate , the colonies were olive to olive - green in color , with a floccose texture , and few aerial mycelia .\nthe color of the colonies was white initially and then turned from light green to dark green and eventually from olive to olive - green .\nexudates and soluble pigment were not produced . in the vegetative stage , septate hyphae , which were 2.03.0  m in diameter , changed in color from hyaline to bright brown with aging and\nthe morphological features of rb-1 after two months of aerobic incubation are shown in figures 1(a)1(e ) .\n. single or occasionally chained aleurioconidia , which were hyaline when young and brown to dark brown when mature , were borne on the tips of the slightly swollen conidiogenous cells or directly on the sides of the vegetative hyphae ( figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) ) .\nmature conidia were globose - shaped or sometimes slightly subglobose - shaped single cells , 7.511.3  m in diameter , and their surfaces were verrucose or punctuate ( figure 1(c ) ) .\nchlamydospores , which were smooth or verrucose , globose to oval , light brown to dark brown , and 9.011.0  m in diameter , occurred frequently in the vegetative hyphae ( figure 1(d ) ) .\n, primordium - like structures constructed with subglobose and globose cells were formed after two months of incubation ( figure 1(e ) ) .\ncolonies on the anaerobic pda plate were always white , and aerial mycelia were rarely observed , at least during the incubation period ( up to 3 months ) . in the presence of caco3 , colonies on the anaerobic pda plate developed at a rate similar to that under aerobic conditions with dissolving insoluble particles of caco3 .\nhowever , in the absence of caco3 , colony development was slower than that under aerobic conditions and ceased when the colonies reached approximately 60  mm in diameter , which indicates that the lowered ph caused by acid production inhibited colony development .\nalthough normal conidium development did not occur under any anaerobic conditions , some swollen cells looking little similar to conidium and chlamydospore structures were observed after three months of incubation ( figure 1(f ) ) . \n\nthermomyces lanuginosus , a fungal species apparently related morphologically to rb-1 , did not grow under any anaerobic conditions .\nmoreover , acid production in its aerobic cultures was not observed different from those of rb-1 .\nthe ssu rdna sequence of rb-1 showed less than 96% similarity with those of other known fungal species and was most closely related to bellemerea alpina ( 95.3% identity ) , which belongs to the order lecanorales of the class lecanoromycetes . a phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of ssu rdna retrieved from the ddbj / genbank / embl databases\ntotals of 30 taxa ( 1,659 to 1,669  bp after alignment ) were used . in this tree\nt. lanuginosus showed a relatively low ssu rdna sequence similarity ( 92.0% identity ) with rb-1 and the presence in the class eurotiomycetes ( figure 2 ) . in order to gain further insight into the classification of rb-1\na ddbj / genbank / embl search revealed that the d1-d2 sequence of rb-1 had low similarity with those of related fungal species ( less than 89% identity ) .\nthe d1-d2 sequence of caloplaca regalis , which is classified as teloschistales of the class lecanoromycetes , showed the highest similarity ( 88.6% identity ) with that of rb-1 .\na phylogenetic tree constructed based on the d1-d2 sequences , which were retrieved from the ddbj / genbank / embl databases , is shown in figure 3 .\ntotals of 29 taxa ( 496 to 500  bp after alignment ) were used to construct a phylogenetic tree . in this tree , rb-1 is related to lecanoromycetes rather than to eurotiomycetes .\nt. lanuginosus is placed in the class eurotiomycetes as same as the phylogenetic tree constructed with the ssu rdna sequences ( figure 2 ) .\nphylogenetic analyses using the its1 and its2 sequences were not carried out because its sequences related to those of rb-1 which are suitable for construction of phylogenetic trees with high confidence could not be retrieved from the ddbj / genbank / embl databases .\nrb-1 grew by consuming glucose and producing acetate and ethanol as fermentation products under both aerobic ( figure 4(a ) ) and anaerobic ( figure 4(b ) ) conditions .\nother possible products including secondary organic compounds , such as hydrogen , succinate , pyruvate , formate , citrate , lactate , glycerol , isopropanol , acetone , propionate , butyrate , glyoxalate , and malonate , were not detected .\nglucose was completely consumed in both aerobic and anaerobic cultures and growth was not terminated if the ph of the cultures was stabilized with caco3 ; acetate and ethanol produced in the ph - stabilized aerobic culture were consumed immediately after the exhaustion of glucose ( data not shown ) .\nthe available initial ph for the growth of rb-1 ranged between 2.5 and 8.0 with an optimum ph of 5.06.0 .\nrb-1 grew at temperatures between 4 and 37c , with an optimum around 2530c . at 37c ,\nconidium development was more prolific at 25c . in both static aerobic and anaerobic liquid cultures\n, rb-1 always grew as a spherical cotton ball on the bottom of the flasks or tubes but not as a floating mat or pellicle .\nrb-1 could use d - glucose , d - galactose , d - mannose , d - fructose , d - xylose , l - arabinose , sucrose , maltose , cellobiose , trehalose , raffinose , starch , inulin , xylan , and pectin as fermentation and growth substrates .\nfermentation on trehalose , inulin , and xylan was much weaker than that on other available substrates .\nall these substrates supported growth and were fermented to acetate , ethanol , and carbon dioxide . in the aerobic cultures ,\nall substrates that were fermentable under anaerobic conditions were also converted to ethanol and acetate . on the other hand ,\nrb-1 did not use l - rhamnose , lactose , melibiose , d - mannitol , d - sorbitol , glycerol , avicell , carboxymethylcellulose , or chitin as fermentation and growth substrates . growth yield and quantitative determinations of ethanol and acetate production on d - glucose are given in table 2 .\nmore acetate than ethanol was produced under both anaerobic ( 1.8 fold ) and aerobic ( 1.9 fold ) conditions .\ngrowth of rb-1 under anaerobic conditions ( in a cysteine - reduced liquid medium ) was sustained constantly from the initial culture after eleven successive transfers in the same medium .\nbecause filamentous fungi are commonly recognized as obligate aerobic organisms , little interest has been paid to their ecological roles and functions in anaerobic environments , including flooded rice field soils .\naccordingly , filamentous fungi have been considered to be less important constituents of natural anaerobic ecosystems ; few studies on anaerobic filamentous fungi in natural habitats have been reported [ 7 , 2729 ] . in the present study ,\nthe author reports on the isolation of a novel facultative anaerobic filamentous fungus from japanese rice field soil .\nsince no sexual reproductive organs were observed , from a morphological standpoint , rb-1 is currently considered a mitosporic fungus .\nthe morphological characteristics of rb-1 are closely related to those of thermomyces lanuginosus and thermomyces verrucose ; the former species has also been isolated from japanese field soil .\nhowever , these species differ from rb-1 in forming single conidia from the conidiophores and their temperature profiles .\nthe phylogenetic statuses of t. lanuginosus and t. verrucose are indistinct , so they are currently classified as mitosporic ascomycetes ( anamorphic ascomycetes ) .\nhowever , recently it has been shown that t. lanuginosus is placed in the class eurotiomycetes and in the order eurotiales based on the phylogenetic analysis using ssu rdna and its sequences   as shown here ( figures 2 and 3 ) . usually ,\ncertainly , there are relatively low similarities of the ssu rdna ( 92.0% identity ) and the d1-d2 sequences ( 82.1% identity ) between rb-1 and t. lanuginosus , which indicates that they are phylogenetically distant . according to the phylogenetic analysis based on the ssu rdna and lsu rdna sequences ,\nrb-1 was probably placed within the class lecanoromycetes of ascomycota ( figures 2 and 3 ) although the precise phylogenetic position is currently unclear .\nfurther phylogenetic studies using other markers such as elongation factors and mitochondrial rdna should be required .\nthus , although rb-1 is probably an anamorph of an unknown ascomycete considered an incertae sedis within the class lecanoromycetes , the classification is still inadequate to define its precise taxonomic status ; therefore , further detailed taxonomic analyses will be needed for nomenclature .\nrb-1 can grow both aerobically and anaerobically , unlike most other ethanol- and acetate - producing fungi ; almost all of which can ferment but not grow under anaerobic conditions [ 35 , 36 ] . in successive transfer experiments for confirming the anaerobiosis ,\nthe growth ability of rb-1 in the strict anaerobic liquid medium reduced with cysteine was steadily maintained even after eleven successive transfers .\na study of anaerobic growth of zygomycetes showed that strains that are apparently capable of anaerobic growth , but require extremely small amounts of oxygen for any growth , are diluted out during successive transfers in anaerobic medium , whereas a strain truly capable of anaerobic proliferation continues growth after ten successive transfers .\nas far as known to the author , few facultative anaerobic filamentous  higher fungi  that can produce metabolic energy by simple fermentation , such as the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae , have been identified [ 28 , 29 ] . as shown in figure 4 and table 2 ,\nthe amount of acetate was higher than that of ethanol , unlike other fermentable ethanol - producing fungi ; almost all of which produce smaller amounts of acetate than ethanol .\na simple comparison can not be made because of differences in the culture conditions and media between those previous studies and this study ; hence the reason for this remains unclear , and metabolic analyses of rb-1 are ongoing .\nthis phenomenon is similar to that of the crabtree - positive yeast cultures in which ethanol production occurs under full aerobic conditions when sugar is present in excess [ 37 , 38 ] .\nproductions of possible compounds other than ethanol , acetate , and carbon dioxide in the culture of rb-1 were not detected .\nif produced , their amounts may be smaller than the detection limits ( < ca .\n0.10.5  mm ) of measuring systems ( hplc and gc ) used in this study .\ninterestingly , rb-1 shows a significant acetate kinase ( ack ) activity , thought to be found strictly in prokaryotic cells , during the growth under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ( unpublished data ) .\nthe phylogenetic , biophysical , and biochemical features of rb-1 indicated here can be distinguished from those of other known fungal species .\nhence , the author concludes that rb-1 is a novel fungus .   as rice fields that are usually exposed to rotating periods of irrigation and drainage during cropping ,\naccordingly , microbial colonies will go through changes responsive to irrigation ( anaerobic conditions ) and drainage ( aerobic conditions ) .\nmoreover , plowed soils of flooded rice fields are heterogeneous environments in which oxygen concentrations differ from those of other anaerobic sites . for example , bulk soils below the soil - water interface are strictly anaerobic ; because oxygen is supplied through floodwaters and the aerenchyma of rice plants , the soil surface , the rhizosphere , and the rhizoplane are aerobic , respectively .\nfacultative anaerobes are probably more adaptable microorganisms in such atypical sites compared to obligatory aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms . hence , although the ecological role and function of rb-1 in rice soil ecosystem are currently unknown , the abilities of rb-1 to acquire metabolic energy and to proliferate in both aerobic and anaerobic environments may be advantageous in such environments .\npreviously , wada   reported that an unidentified spore - forming filamentous fungus colonized rice straws in submerged rice soil where the anaerobic condition was sufficient for sulfate reducing . recently , several researchers reported that when nitrate is supplied , many filamentous fungi can acquire metabolic energy in oxygen - limited and anaerobic environments by nitrate respiration and ammonia fermentation , respectively [ 10 , 11 , 41 ] .\na recent research indicated that up to 89% of n2o emitted from soils to atmospheres could be attributed to fungal activity .\nall these findings suggest that filamentous fungi capable of growth in the absence of oxygen are likely distributed in anaerobic environments in greater numbers than expected ."}

dependent mds ( 2025 rbc units , serum ferritin > 1000 or > 2000  ng / ml ) in order to reduce the body iron burden and further toxicities .\nit is of interest to determine factors associated with hematologic response and mechanisms of relapse .\nreduction in oxidative stress has been proposed as main explanation for this improvement and alternative mechanisms may include redistribution of iron , effect on bone marrow microenvironments or on the neoplastic clone 817 .\nrbc transfusion dependence is observed in higher risk mds but also contributes to iron overload in lower risk disease due to increased absorption of iron from the gut .\nhecpidin , a key negative regulator of iron export from gut and macrophages , is typically suppressed in conditions such as thalassemia or ineffective erythropoiesis 18 . more recently ,\nhumans lack a physiological excretion mechanism for excess iron and each rbc unit contains approximately 200250  mg of elemental iron 18 .\nin addition , excess iron has been shown to suppress erythropoiesis , as evidenced by decreased burst - forming units erythroid ( bfu - e ) in patients with elevated ferritin 20 .\nthis pathological form of nontransferrin - bound iron ( ntbi ) that take up by cells , lead to a rise in labile iron pool ( lip ) and generate reactive oxygen species ( ros ) .\nit is well known that oxidative stress leads to oxidation of proteins , lipids , and dna with increased apoptosis , organ damage , and genomic instability 21,13 .\n22 observed that the drug is also active nf -

phase reactant and trs has a day - to - day variability 18 .\nit is well recognized that red cell transfusion iron first accumulates within reticuloendothelial cell , thereafter macrophages release excess iron and organ damage occurred ( liver , heart , endocrine glands ) .\nmore accurate assessment of liver iron concentration ( lic ) is possible via invasive methods ( contraindicated in mds due to thrombocytopenia ) or via magnetic resonance imaging 18 .\nseveral consensus groups have suggested guidelines on ict 2532 including parameters for initiation ( 2025 rbc units and serum ferritin > 1000 or > 2000  ng / ml ) , patient features ( life expectancy > 6  months or > 1  year and low / intermediate1 ipss ) , target serum ferritin ( < 500 or < 1000 ) .\nfew retrospective studies assessed organ overload in mds 917 . in addition , cardiac iron disease is reported only in a small fraction of heavily transfused mds 3335 .\ntherefore , in the absence of prospective clinical trial iron chelation should be tailored to individuals .\nlife expectancy and comorbidities ( especially renal impairment due to documented toxicity of the drug ) , accurate transfusion history and hepatitis ( which may affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug ) , serum ferritin or laboratory evidence of iron excess ( e.g. , hereditary hemocromatosis ) may represent key factors to make decisions about ict . comparing different series of patients\nis difficult because of different duration of treatment or combination of iron chelation drugs , inclusion or exclusion of cases receiving other hematological modifying drugs , different decision making regarding red cell transfusion and response criteria .\nprincipal clinical studies with deferasirox in mds patients lic , liver iron concentration ; lpi , labile plasma iron ; os , overall survival ; e / p / n , erythroid / platelet / neutrophil ; hb , hemoglobin ; ps , patients ; ict , iron chelation therapy . porter et  al . compare the response of iron chelation in mds and other anemias ( diamon -

{"id": 39, "text": "two critical neurotransmitters , serotonin ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ; 5-ht ) and dopamine , are synthesized from the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine , respectively.1,2 serotonin synthesis in vivo is accomplished by a two - step process converting tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-htp ) , facilitated by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase , and 5-htp is then decarboxylated by dihydroxyphenalanine ( dopa ) decarboxylase to form serotonin .\ntyrosine is converted to dopamine by the combined action of tyrosine hydroxylase to form dopa and dopa decarboxylase to form dopamine .\nthe synthesis of serotonin is commonly stimulated by dietary delivery of l-5-hydroxytryptophan ( 5-htp)3 and dopamine synthesis is stimulated by dietary administration of either tyrosine or l - dihydroxyphenylalanine ( l - dopa).4 protein - containing foods such as meat and dairy products are good natural sources of both tyrosine and tryptophan .\nthese agents are utilized as natural supplements to augment brain levels of either serotonin or dopamine .\nthis study investigates the effects of 5-htp and tyrosine ingestion on urinary excretion of serotonin and dopamine in a large sample of humans ingesting 5-htp and tyrosine .\ncuriously , the urinary excretion of these compounds after ingestion of 5-htp or tyrosine has only been reported in human trials involving very small patient cohorts and the results involve anomalous responses.57 therefore , this study was designed to critically test the hypothesis that increased ingestion of 5-htp or tyrosine elevates urinary excretion of serotonin and dopamine , respectively .\nthe purpose of the study was to determine if urinary excretion of serotonin or dopamine reflect the adequacy of supplementation with 5 htp or tyrosine .\nthe study included 824 individuals ingesting 5-htp , tyrosine , both 5-htp and tyrosine , or neither .\nmultiple urine samples were obtained from all of these individuals and most received multiple doses of supplements to enable comparisons between doses of supplements and urinary excretion of mature neurotransmitters , as well as the relationship between changes in doses and changes in urinary neurotransmitter excretion .\nthe primary rationale for using the dietary supplements was weight loss although a significant number of patients were treated for diseases other than obesity that were caused by , or associated with , serotonin and/or dopamine dysfunction .\nthe supplements were taken in divided doses two , three , or four times a day depending on the dosing of amino acid precursors administered .\nurine samples were collected six hours prior to bedtime with 4:00 pm being the most frequent collection time point .\nthe urine samples were collected after a minimum of one week at a specific dose of the precursor being consumed .\nsamples were shipped to dbs laboratories ( duluth , mn , usa ) under the direction of one of the authors ( dr thomas uncini , a hospital - based dual board certified laboratory pathologist ) .\nurinary dopamine and serotonin were assayed utilizing commercially available radioimmunoassay kits ( 3 cat ria ib88501 and ib89527 ; immuno biological laboratories , inc . ,\nthe dbs laboratories are accredited as a high complexity laboratory by clinical laboratory improvement amendments ( clia ) to perform these assays .\nstatistical evaluations utilized either two - way anova to compare dose - response curves or regression analyses to establish correlations between precursor doses and urinary excretion of serotonin and dopamine .\nthese regression analyses were conducted to determine if a statistically definable relationship existed between dose of precursor and excretion of the resulting neurotransmitter .\njmp ( sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) software was used to perform the statistical analysis .\ndata were evaluated further by subdividing responses into the following : 1 ) those representing inverse relationships between dietary supplement intake and urinary excretion of neurotransmitter , deemed phase 1 ; 2 ) those exhibiting no relationship between dietary supplement intake and neurotransmitter excretion , deemed phase 2 ; and 3 ) those exhibiting a direct relationship between dietary supplement consumption and neurotransmitter excretion in the urine ( phase 3 ) .\nthese groups were identified by dividing alterations in neurotransmitter excretion by alterations in supplement dose to obtain the slope of the relationship .\nphases 1 , 2 , and 3 had negative , 0 , and positive slopes , respectively .\nthey also were compared with daily fluctuations in urinary neurotransmitter efflux in the absence of supplement ingestion ( ie , phase 0 ) .\nthis analysis was performed to determine if the alterations in serotonin or dopamine excretion in phases 1 , 2 , or 3 could be accounted for by circadian rhythms and/or daily fluctuations in neurotransmitter excretion resulting from stress or other factors .\nthe latter comparison involved the students t test comparing the absolute value of deviations in neurotransmitter excretion in all groups .\nthe conversion to absolute values was necessary because samples contained both positive and negative alterations in neurotransmitter excretion that conformed to the appropriate response for a specific phase .\nfor instance , a reduction in precursor dose in phase 3 resulted in a reduction in neurotransmitter excretion .\nalthough the change in neurotransmitter excretion was negative in this example , it represented the appropriate directional change for samples in phase 3 .\nthis study was exempt from institutional review board review at the university of minnesota because it was a retrospective study of deidentified data .\nthe correlation between 5 htp doses and urinary sertotonin excretion was not statistically significant ( r = 0.040 ; p = 0.09 ) .\nall of these individuals also were consuming tyrosine , therefore we sought an interaction with tyrosine as well , but there was none ( p = 0.50 ) .\nsurprisingly , the data from these experiments indicate only a marginal relationship between administration of a serotonin precursor and urinary excretion of serotonin .\nwe then sought a more convincing relationship by analyzing the effect of 5-htp dosing alterations on changes in urinary serotonin excretion in individual patients .\nthese experiments were conceived to ascertain whether individuals exhibited dramatically different basal levels of urinary serotonin excretion but consistently responded to changes in precursor administration with increased excretion of the serotonin .\nfigure 2 depicts a statistically significant relationship between changes in 5-htp administration and alterations in urinary efflux of serotonin ( p < 0.0001 ; r = 0.145 ) .\nthese data indicate a relationship between ingested 5-htp and urinary serotonin excretion , but this effect remains modest based on the regression coefficient .\nfurther examination of the data in figure 2 indicated that , of the 1671 individual data points , 390 demonstrated an inverse relationship between changes in urinary serotonin excretion and 5-htp administration , 375 showed virtually no change in urinary serotonin excretion ( ie , an alteration of less than 2000 g / g creatinine ) after altering the 5-htp dose and 860 experienced the anticipated direct relationship between changes in urinary serotonin excretion and 5-htp dose .\nfurthermore , 46 samples represented the random variation in urinary serotonin excretion when no 5-htp or tyrosine dosing occurred .\nthus the relationship between alterations in 5-htp dose and urinary serotonin excretion demonstrated in figure 2 appears to derive from three distinct responses being summed in the data presented .\nthe average value of each of these three different responses , plus the random daily fluctuation in the absence of precursors , is shown in figure 3 .\nthe results in the absence of any alteration in 5-htp dose ( ie , normal circadian rhythms or other disturbances ) are compared to those representing the three different responses when 5-htp dosing was varied .\nthis comparison was necessary to determine if there is a de facto statistical difference between the different patterns of responses and whether the responses are distinctly different than random fluctuations in serotonin excretion .\nthe data are presented as absolute values of changes in serotonin excretion because the magnitude of the change in serotonin excretion is the critical variable . as shown in figure 3 , both phase 1 ( inverse correlation between altered 5-htp dosing and serotonin excretion ) and phase 3 ( direct correlation between altered 5-htp dosing and serotonin excretion ) had much larger , statistically significant variations in comparison to the values representing random fluctuation of serotonin excretion ( indicated as phase 0 ) ( p < 0.0001 both phases ) .\nphase 2 responses ( ie , indicative of virtually no change in serotonin excretion in response to a change in 5-htp administration ) also were statistically different from either phases 0 , 1 , or 3 ( p < 0.0001 ) .\nthe dose - response curves for 5-htp vs. urinary serotonin excretion for the three phases are shown in figure 4 .\nthe 5-htp suppressed urinary serotonin excretion in the phase 1 samples and augmented excretion in the phase 3 samples .\nthe phase 0 and phase 2 samples had extremely low urinary serotonin levels and the concentrations did not fluctuate in response to alterations in 5-htp dosing .\nphase 2 values were significantly lower than urinary serotonin levels in either phase 1 or phase 3 samples ( p < 0.0001 ) and\nthe slopes of the curves for phases 1 , 2 , and 3 differed significantly ( p  0.0022 ) .\nurinary serotonin excretion in the absence of 5-htp dosing was statistically higher in the phase 1 samples than any of the other groups .\nthis finding is consistent with the phase 1 group demonstrating large declines in urinary serotonin levels in response to increased administration of 5-htp .\nthe stimulatory effect of 5-htp observed in phase 3 samples occurred primarily in the dose range of 150 to 900 mg 5-htp .\na maximal effect appeared to be achieved at the 900 mg 5-htp dose and no further increment in urinary serotonin concentrations was observed at higher 5-htp doses .\nthe inhibitory effect of tyrosine was statistically significant and yielded a concentration - dependent effect based on linear regression analysis ( p < 0.0001 , r = 0.086 ) .\nas with the relationship between 5-htp consumption and serotonin excretion , the tyrosine effect on urinary dopamine excretion represented a summation of responses exhibiting one of the following : an inverse correlation ; no effect ; or a direct correlation .\nconsistent with the data shown in figure 5 , the fluctuations in dopamine excretion were smaller in samples obtained from patients ingesting incrementally greater amounts of tyro - sine ; and this difference for the combined phases 1 , 2 , and 3 reached a high level of statistical significance ( p < 0.0001 ) when compared to phase 0 samples .\nthe fluctuations in the phase 2 samples were less than any other phase ( p  0.005 ) .\nthe levels in phase 1 and 3 samples were not statistically different from levels in phase 0 samples ( p = 0.09 for both ) .\nthese data add support to the surprising observation that tyrosine ingestion suppresses urinary dopamine excretion .\nthe relationship between tyrosine doses and urinary dopamine excretion in the three response phases is shown in figure 7 .\nthese data were presented as mean data with standard errors for clarity necessitated by substantial overlap of raw data points .\nthe slope of this curve was negative and statistically different from the curves representing phases 2 or 3 ( p < 0.0001 ) .\nphase 2 and 3 did not exhibit statistically discernable slopes ( p = 0.32 ) , but the urinary dopamine levels were statistically greater in phase 3 samples ( p = 0.0007 ) .\nthe data presented in this study indicate that consumption of specific dietary precursors of serotonin or dopamine only increases the urinary excretion of these neurotransmitters approximately 50% of the time .\nprobably the most surprising finding of this study is that 20% to 40% of these same individuals respond to the precursors with an unexpected reduction in excretion of the neurotransmitters , particularly dopamine .\nthese observations indicate that the simplistic expectation that increased ingestion of neurotransmitter precursors will increase excretion of the mature neurotransmitters in the urine is frequently not observed .\nthe uncoupling of neurotransmitter excretion from the ingestion of precursors for the neurotransmitter is most likely caused by the degradation of blood - borne neurotransmitter in the kidney.8,9 most of the serotonin or dopamine found in the urine is synthesized in the kidney.912 therefore , the excreted neurotransmitters must be synthesized in the kidneys and escape reabsorption into the blood in order to be excreted in the urine .\nmost of the serotonin formed by the kidneys is typically catabolized2 or reabsorbed and not excreted in the urine.8,11,13 alternatively , dopamine synthesized in the kidney is secreted across the apical surface into the urine14 probably by an organic cation transporter9,15 resulting in greater urinary than interstitial dopamine concentrations.12,13 larger doses of tyrosine and 5-htp have been observed to increase both urinary dopamine and serotonin excretion.1618 the array of catabolic and reabsorptive events probably accounts for the far more complex responses than expected to 5-htp or tyrosine ingestion observed in this study . in spite of the complex sequence of renal events accounting for the appearance of neurotransmitter in urine , the presence of opposing responses ( ie , phases 1 and 3 ) does not seem possible without a direct effect of either the precursors or the formed neurotransmitters to cause an aberration in the series of events leading to the presence of urinary neurotransmitters . based on a large volume of studies in the literature ,\nit is likely that administration of 5-htp increases the synthesis of serotonin within the kidney.2,3,8 transporters for serotonin then transfer it into the blood stream to prevent it from being excreted in the urine .\nthe phase 1 response we observed for serotonin could be explained by either a neurotransmitter - induced allosteric alteration of a reabsorptive transporter to increase activity or an induction of the synthesis of the transporter .\nincreased transport of the neurotransmitters out of the region of the nephron would theoretically reduce urinary excretion of the neurotransmitter , as observed in phase 1 . if the alteration or induction were great enough , essentially all of the neurotransmitter would be reabsorbed and little or none would appear in the urine , as observed in phase 2 .\na conversion to phase 3 would be possible if the supply of neurotransmitter eventually increased enough to saturate the transport process and result in spillage of neurotransmitter into the urine .\nall three phases have been observed in the same individual and the three phases could represent different stages of renal processing of 5-htp .\nwe currently have no evidence explaining the different phases and the potential for increased activity or induction of neurotransmitter transporters merely appears to be the most likely possibility explaining these observations at this point in time .\nthis scenario probably necessitates either an inhibition of dopamine secretion into the nephron lumen or a reduction in renal dopamine synthesis .\ntwo reports indicate that newly synthesized dopamine is normally secreted into the nephron,12,13 thus an inhibition of this secretion could account for the inhibitory effect .\nit is likely that tyrosine could interfere with the secretion of dopamine into the lumen of the nephron but we are unaware of any reports supporting this site of action .\ntyrosine appears to be an unlikely inhibitor of renal dopamine synthesis because it is widely recognized as a dopamine precursor .\nhowever , tyrosine suppresses l - dopa uptake into proximal tubule cells14,19 and l - dopa uptake is required for renal dopamine synthesis.20 l - dopa is the immediate precursor to dopamine in the synthetic pathway ; therefore , inhibition of its uptake could impair dopamine synthesis .\nproximal tubule cells accumulate tyrosine14 but the kidney lacks extraneuronal tyrosine hydroxylase1,21,22 and can not convert it to dopamine .\nthus , tyrosine could have a paradoxical inhibition of dopamine synthesis in the kidney by suppressing l - dopa uptake into proximal tubule cells .\nan alternative scenario potentially accounting for phase 3 responses to tyrosine involves the peripheral conversion of tyrosine to l - dopa in neuronal tissue .\nthe l - dopa entering the kidney could serve as a precursor to dopamine and result in increased dopamine secretion observed in phase 3 .\nthe observation of the inhibitory ( ie , phase 1 ) response to tyrosine has not been reported previously .\na plethora of reports indicate that phase 3 stimulatory effects of tyrosine on urinary dopamine excretion is the predominant response in most studies in rats4,22,23 and protein has been widely used as a tyrosine source to increase dopamine excretion in humans.24 it is possible that the phase 1 response to tyrosine in humans has not been noted previously because of the limited number of studies specifically investigating tyrosine effects on human dopamine excretion .\nthe novel observations noted in this study include a somewhat variable relationship between ingested 5-htp and urinary serotonin excretion and the unexpected influence of tyrosine to reduce urinary dopamine excretion .\nthe description of the three phases demonstrating the relationship between 5-htp and urinary serotonin excretion is also novel and probably is a reflection of serotonin reabsorption in the kidney .\nthe consistent and statistically discernable ability of tyrosine to dampen fluctuations in urinary dopamine excretion is also noteworthy .\nthese processes might be reflective of similar processes occurring in other organs and suggest that urine sampling for neurotransmitters requires multiple samples to determine the direction of the response and , potentially , the adequacy of dosing ."}
{"id": 40, "text": "every year , more than 9 million babies die in utero or in the first few weeks of life , and the majority of these deaths occur in developing countries , where teratogens play a major role.1 in fact , the term  teratogen \nis used to designate products with teratogenic potential at clinical doses used in humans.2 it indicates an exposure to a physical or chemical agent that can interfere with normal development of cells and tissues and results in abnormalities and malformations in newborns.3 currently , reproductive toxicologists consider the four major manifestations of abnormal fetal development to be growth alteration , functional deficit , structural malformation , and death.4 teratogenicity can be triggered by many materials , such as medications and licit substances like alcohol , caffeine , and tobacco.3 despite the lack of information on the safety of drug use during pregnancy , most pregnant women will likely be exposed to drugs . indeed\n, fetal exposure can occur either before or after a woman knows she is pregnant .\nmany epidemiological studies have demonstrated that using drugs is associated with an increased risk of birth defects,2 depending on types , timing , frequency , intensity , and duration of exposure.2 on the other hand , exposure to smoke , coffee , and alcohol during pregnancy can contribute to perinatal complications and poor neonatal outcomes , consequences that have been well identified in epidemiological studies .\neffectively , maternal smoking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for miscarriage , perinatal mortality , low birth weight , premature births , and small babies.59 despite the risks , many women still smoke during pregnancy : 17% in england and wales,10 and 14% in the us.11 in lebanon , a study conducted by chaaya and collaborators showed that pregnant women were partially knowledgeable about the health risks of cigarette and water - pipe smoking , and they had permissive attitudes towards all forms of smoking .\nmoreover , almost one - quarter ( 23% ) of participants reported smoking during pregnancy , with 17% smoking only cigarettes , 4% smoking only water pipe , and 1.5% smoking both.12 smoking is responsible for 15% of all preterm births and increases the risk of perinatal mortality threefold.13 although caffeine has been demonstrated to produce birth defects and fetal mortality in animal models , its effects in humans at normal levels of consumption are much less certain . a high level of coffee consumption is however associated with an increased risk of fetal death ; it was linked to various adverse pregnancy outcomes , including fetal loss , birth defects , and fetal growth retardation.14 finally , drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage , premature birth , stillbirth , low birth weight,15 and a range of lifelong disorders , known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.16 the most known , fetal alcohol syndrome , is one of the leading known preventable causes of mental retardation and birth defects.16 to our knowledge , no data exist about exposure of pregnant women to these substances in lebanon .\nwhile the harmful effects of different medications and licit substance use during pregnancy may potentially constitute a major public health concern worldwide , few epidemiological studies have examined the actual prevalence of risky substance exposure during pregnancy and its relation to perinatal problems in lebanon .\nthese data are important when making recommendations to health - care providers on screening substance use during pregnancy and for helping pregnant women to avoid these substances .\ntherefore , this study aimed to assess risky exposure of pregnant lebanese women to drugs , tobacco , caffeine , and alcohol ; a secondary objective was to assess their effect on postnatal outcomes .\nconsecutive delivering women at term were addressed after delivery in five university tertiary care hospitals of beirut and mount lebanon between january and june 2012 ;

babies born from tobacco - smoking mothers had approximately three times more risk of having medical problems requiring ncu transfer .\ncoffee consumption may also be strongly associated with neonatal medical problems ( adjusted odds ratio [ aor ] = 4.37 ) .\nas expected , we also noticed that having a late delivery is highly associated with a decrease in the risk of neonates developing medical problems , or having underweight babies ( p < 0.001 ) .\nwe observed that consuming category c drugs ( aor = 2.01 , confidence interval 1.064.02 ) or being a passive smoker ( aor = 2.2 , confidence interval = 1.134.31 ) were significantly associated with increased risk of having underweight babies .\nactive tobacco smoking was associated with a higher risk of underweight babies ( aor > 1 ) , but the results did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.151 ) . concerning the relationship between the apgar score and drug and other substance use during pregnancy , we found that higher frequencies of weekly water pipe and of daily cigarette pack consumption were associated with a lower apgar score at 5 or 10 minutes .\nthe exposure to category d drugs during pregnancy was also significantly related to a smaller apgar 10 .\nin addition , we found that having gestational diabetes was negatively associated with apgar score .\nfinally , exposure to category x drugs may negatively affect the apgar 5 ( p = 0.07 ) ( table 4 ) .\nour study evaluated the exposure of pregnant lebanese women to risky substances and their influence on birth outcomes .\nwe noticed that the participants were exposed to multiple factors that may affect the neonates health .\nindeed , most of them drank caffeinated beverages ( 75% ) , while substantial proportions were exposed to smoking ( active and passive , cigarette and water pipe ) , alcohol , and drugs .\nour results are more or less similar to those of others for coffee,20,21 smoking,22,23 alcohol,24 and drugs.25,26 for active smoking , they are lower than those of chaaya and collaborators,12 probably due to the higher education level of our population .\nthe high consumption of caffeinated beverages is not surprising , given that the use of caffeinated substances is not forbidden by doctors during pregnancy , since reports about its harm on the fetus are scant and inconclusive,27 as opposed to alcohol or tobacco consumption .\nit is troubling , however , given that coffee consumption was associated with higher risk of neonates medical problems with a tendency to significance ( p = 0.064 ) ; in fact , the occurrence of congenital malformations , fetal growth retardation , small - for - date babies , miscarriages ( spontaneous abortions ) , behavioral effects , and maternal fertility problems that presumably resulted from caffeine consumption have all been reported.28 in a danish study of 7346 pregnant women , authors found that consumption of coffee during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of fetal death , especially losses occurring after 20 completed weeks of gestation.29 the increased risk was linked to various adverse pregnancy outcomes , including fetal loss , birth defects , fetal growth retardation , and increased number of uterine contraction peaks .\nthus , coffee consumption during pregnancy has been subject to preventive action in some countries,30 and was recommended to be restricted by several researchers.31,32 on the other hand , the trend we found may be due to the fact that caffeine is present at different concentrations in many beverages , including coffee , tea , and colas , as well as chocolate , and in our study we did not differentiate and divide our analysis into the types of caffeinated beverages , but took all in at once .\nseveral other associations of substance use during pregnancy emerged from this study : our results showed a significant association between mothers tobacco smoking and elevated risk of medical problems .\nindeed , babies born from tobacco - smoking mothers had approximately three times more risk of having medical problems requiring ncu transfer . paralleling our results ,\nnumerous studies have shown strong associations between maternal cigarette smoking and neonatal morbidity and mortality.3335 in other studies , smoking was recognized as a major risk factor for poor birth outcomes that needed transfer to the ncu.36 furthermore , some researchers found that maternal smoking was associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome .\nkrl and collaborators confirmed that active smoking during pregnancy had a negative effect on the cerebral mass of the neonate ; the deficiency in cerebral mass increased with greater smoking intensity.37 the risk to the developing fetus seems primarily due to the nicotine : the biological mechanisms of how nicotine affects fetal development have been examined in extensive human and laboratory studies , which showed that nicotine crosses the placenta and targets specific neurotransmitter receptors in the fetal brain , eliciting abnormal cell proliferation and increasing susceptibility to hypoxia - induced brain damage.3,38 in addition , we demonstrated , consistently with other research,30 that babies born to women who smoked a water pipe during pregnancy had a higher proportion of immediate need for extra medical or emergency care . for active cigarette smoking ,\nalthough we found a relationship between active smoking and underweight , the relationship we found did not reach statistical significance , probably due to the low prevalence of active smokers or the low smoking dose .\nsimilarly , we found a doubling of the risk of underweight in babies of women who were exposed to passive smoking ; this is consistent with other studies in which high environmental tobacco - smoke exposure was associated with low birth weight , preterm birth , and most strongly preterm birth.39 on average , birth weight was reduced by 120 g per pack of cigarettes ( or cigar / pipe equivalent ) smoked daily by the father.40 alcohol use was much less reported during pregnancy than other substances ( 1.1% ) in this study .\nthis is due to the low number of pregnant women that were reported drinking alcohol during their pregnancy .\nour participants seemed to be consuming medications belonging to categories b ( 72.9% ) and c ( 34.9% ) , whereas category d ( 10.6% ) and x ( 0.3% ) drugs were much less taken .\nthis indicates that pregnant lebanese women may have been more likely to stay away from the most dangerous drug categories ( d and x ) , as might have been recommended by their doctor and/or pharmacist .\nother explanations would be that they may have less access to or need of these drugs , in addition to social desirability in responding , or , they may be underreporting these drugs for fear of legal consequences of disclosing this information .\nhowever , we think that the latter explanations are less likely , and we doubt that lebanese women are aware of the classification of drugs during pregnancy .\nnevertheless , confirmation of drug use with urine samples would have given more credibility to prevalence rates ; further studies are suggested to take into account this last point .\nour results are however similar to those of other countries : for instance , about two - thirds of women in the us take one or more prescription medications during pregnancy .\nnevertheless , it was found that more that 90% of the medications approved by the fda from 1980 to 2000 had insufficient data to determine safety in pregnancy.41 in addition , in a national study done in brazil on 610 pregnant women , results were similar to ours , and category d and x drugs were taken during pregnancy in low percentages.42 furthermore , in the multivariate analysis , the use of these medications during pregnancy was associated with the newborn s status in several ways : category c medication intake was associated with underweight birth , while the use of d- and x - category drugs were associated with increased risk of immediate need for intensive care .\nfirst , a selection bias is possible , since we worked with women who delivered in university tertiary care hospitals of the capital and surroundings ; they may not represent the childbearing lebanese population , particularly those of lower socioeconomic status from remote areas .\nwe expect our results to be underestimating the true prevalence of exposure to toxic substances during pregnancy .\nmoreover , the data are cross - sectional , and therefore no causal relationships can be inferred ; analytical results are presented indicatively .\nsecond , the risk of developing birth defects depends on exposure , timing , dosing , and route of administration;2 this information was missing from our data , and while reporting substance use for analysis , there was no specification of timing of exposure , dose , or route of administration for these substances .\nin fact , we did not collect information about these factors because of probable nondifferential memory bias ; this may lead to crucial differences in results between using substances in the first trimester and afterwards .\nthe information bias could also be differential , women with children who had health problems being more able to remember exposures than women with healthy children ; this bias is expected to induce false - positive associations .\nthird , a medical problem that occurred in newborns was not detailed because of the low number of babies that had such a problem , which precluded detailed analysis , and we could not perform any analysis on congenital malformations since only two cases were found .\nfinally , a confounding bias is possible , since we may not have taken all potential confounders into account or the sample size may have precluded showing some associations .\nfor example , although anemia would be expected to affect birth weight , it was removed from the final model in our study ; this may be due to an underpowering of our sample size or to a low severity of anemia , given particularly that the majority of women were taking iron supplements .\nalthough larger - scale studies may be necessary to adjust or confirm our analytical results , we do not expect that drastic changes in essential results would occur , especially concerning substantial levels of exposure to some substances and medications .\nour study demonstrated that lebanese women were exposed during pregnancy to medications and licit substances that affected neonates health .\nsome risk factors associated with neonatal medical problems were identified , including active tobacco smoking and coffee consumption . consuming category c drugs or being a passive smoker was associated with increased risk of having underweight babies .\nhigher weekly water - pipe exposure , number of daily cigarette packs , or exposure to category d drugs during pregnancy were associated with a lower apgar score .\nour findings have implications for clinical obstetric practice and prevention and intervention programs : clinicians should screen all pregnant women for smoking , exposure to caffeine , and other substance use and give them appropriate advice and explain all risks that may develop while using these substances ."}
{"id": 41, "text": "stainless steel and nickel - titanium ( ni - ti ) rotary instruments have been used for canal preparation purposes . in recent years , ni - ti rotary instruments have allowed much improvement in endodontics canal preparation .\nni - ti instruments are known to be more superelastic and flexible in bending and torsion than stainless steel files .\noften , depending on the dentist experience , they are replaced before reaching their elastic limit . despite the advantages of ni - ti instrumentation , unexpected instrument failure occurs during clinical use , in relation to mechanical root canal properties .\nseveral researchers conducted researches using a specially designed torque - testing apparatus , later detailed torque and force values present in clinical situations and the conditions that may lead to instrument failure depending on preloading and instrument movements . under the normal use ,\nin addition , the temperature of files which increases due to the instrument 's thermodynamical situation will promote instrument failure .\nirrigation solutions which are used during root canal preparation can decrease the instrument temperature and consequently decrease the chance of instrument failure .\nthe revolution speed of the instruments inside the root canal also interferes in the heat production and its transmission to the external surface since speed is directly proportional to heat .\nresearch has revealed that the anatomical diameter of the root canal and the amount of remaining dentine are factors that can contribute to the higher or lower temperature dissipation .\nresearch has been performed on the ( pro instrument # 0.6 , dentsply tulsa , switzerland ) rotary instrument failure in the presence of sodium hypochlorite .\nthe effect of temperature on the viscosity of the root canal material as well as the root temperature gradient has also been studied .\nthe use of sodium hypochlorite ( naocl ) to irrigate root canals is currently the standard and one of the best irrigation to achieve tissue dissolution and disinfection . in a study evaluating the effects of irrigation on cutting efficiency k - files , tap water and 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solutions increased the cutting efficiency compared with dry conditions .\none additional factor potentially limiting the resistance to fatigue and torsional fracture is corrosion that may occur in the presence of naocl solution .\na rise in temperature was reported in the root surface of human teeth during post - space preparation at a point 6 mm from the apex of the tooth using a thermocouple attached to a chart recorder .\nhence , it was suggested that the use of ni - ti rotary instrument to prepare post channels in the teeth will generate heat that may cause tissue damage , and caution should be exercised during their use .\nthere was no statistically significant difference between temperature elevations recorded in vitro and those measured in vivo , which validates in vitro .\nresearch was conducted at temperature elevations far above body temperature , which may be sufficient to cause bone tissue injury .\nthe demonstration stress and strain analysis of ni - ti instrument indicated that torsional and flexural stresses are important causes in instrument failure .\nadditionally , temperature could be considered as one of the major factors which influence fatigue , fracture , and instrument failure . when using ni - ti rotary instruments for canal preparation , the continuous tensile and compressive stress cycles in the canal region of maximum curved lead to mechanical fatigue .\nthus , ni - ti fatigue resistance is the parameter that determines , in most cases , the applicability of the device . in general ,\nfatigue - crack growth resistance has been reported to increase with decreasing temperature , such that fatigue thresholds were higher and crack - growth rates slower in martensite compared with austenite and superelastic austenite .\nseparate studies have shown that the temperature of ni - ti wire increases under low - cycle and high - amplitude fatigue conditions , which are caused , apparently , by the martensite - austenite phase transformation in each cycle .\nfatigue of metals is influenced by a number of factors and described by the coffin \nmanson equation which is as follows : where , a and b are considered empirical material constants .\nit has been considered that these instrument failure parameters a and b are influenced by additional operational and environmental parameters such as c ( specific heat transfer ) . in another study , it was also found that the number of instrument failure increases and lifetime variability decreases with increasing c ( relative specific heat ) .\nphysically , this means that the ability of solution to absorb the heat generated by the cycling ni - ti rotary instruments proportionally correlates with its lifetime .\nthe specific heat of ni - ti is ( cni- ti=0.20 cal / gc . ) ; thus , when ni - ti instruments are rotated in an environmental fluid such as water ( cwater=1.00 cal/ gc ) , or naocl ( cnaocl=0.94 cal / gc ) , the fluid acts as an efficient heat absorber and attracts the energy generated by transforming ni - ti without an appreciable increase in temperature .\nin contrast , when the ni - ti rotary instrument is rotated in a non - irrigated environment ( cair=0.24 cal / gc ) , the solution surrounds the rotating ni - ti instrument that reduces heat dissipation and thus decreases the number of rotation leading to failure .\nthe aforementioned possibility justifies the need for a better understanding of rotary ni - ti file rupture in order to devise possible methods to increase file fatigue life according to a constant temperature which has been the subject of some bench studies .\nthe number of cycles caused fracture for ni - ti files at four different temperatures with a single irrigation solution which have been also investigated in separate . in the light of above\nmentioned reports , it is evident that the controlled impacts of real -

factor analysis of variance ( anova ) .\nas shown in figure 3 , the number of rotations to failure under naocl was significantly greater than that of air and water ( p<0.01 ) .\nsimilarly , the number of rotations to failure under water was significantly greater than that of air ( p<0.01 ) .\nsignificant differences ( analysis of variance with anova tests ) are indicated by horizontal bars . significantly different from water and air . significantly different from air\nthe mean values of file temperature generated under different irrigation - tested solutions at different time points are depicted in figure 4 .\nthe file temperature values for the naocl group at all time points were significantly less than those of water ( p<0.01 ) and non - irrigation circumstances .\nstatistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference ( p<0.01 ) between temperature of the air and non - irrigation conditions .\ntemperature differences between the 5% sodium hypochlorite group and the water and air groups were found to be statistically significant ; there appears to be an increase in temperature values from the no irrigation and water solution with comparison with sodium hypochlorite . by using the q - square\n, it was shown that there were differences ( p<0.01 ) between the three groups for solution .\ntemperature changes with time under three different irrigation conditions including air , water , and naocl .\nthe current research assessed the effects of irrigation of profile ni - ti rotary files in different solution and found a marked reduction of file failure and temperature with computerize control system .\nnumber of rotations to failure under different irrigation are in agreement with a recent study on protaper ( dentsply , maillefer ) files which indicated that with increase number of rotation this with correlation with file failure .\nhowever , it contradicts the reports that resistance to fatigue of profiles was unaltered after immersion in naocl for 24 hours to be stable .\ncontrol of testing temperature is of paramount relevance since structural state of ni - ti alloy depends on temperature , as shown by d.s.c assays .\nthe first section evaluated the effect of different solution on temperature gradient of instruments and the second part allowed observation of the effect of such solution on instrument failure that causes fracture during root canal preparation .\nthus , it was important that the machine was set to record temperature , rpm , and failure parameters that can cause fracture fatigue accurately .\nthe rotary instruments test machine used in this study was set to work on constant environmental condition .\nirrigation solution has been recommended for the use of ni - ti rotary instrument ; beneficial effects such as reduction of temperature or elimination of instrument fractures have not been conclusively demonstrated in particular in in - vivo status .\nthis is a novel computerized control system in vivo approach designed to evaluate the effect of temperature changes on file failure with different solutions used during engine - driven rotary root canal preparation .\nit was suggested that cutting efficiency of ni - ti instruments in the presence of different irrigation was increased .\nthe promotion of cutting efficiency could be a reflection of a decrease in temperature . in the present study , irrigation solutions such as water and naocl\nwere generally more effective than the non - irrigation condition in decreasing file and canal temperature .\nwhilst irrigation condition depends mainly on film formation and reversible physical surface modification , it is also possible to chemically modify the surfaces that are subjected to friction .\nprevious studies involving the effect of irrigation systems on the resistance , fatigue , and corrosion on the files do not completely mirror actual clinical situation including high temperature , contact time , etc .\nlonger exposure times may increase the chemical effect on file mechanical and thermomechanical properties ( i.e. , corrosion phenomena ) , which results in reduced number of rotations to failure for ni - ti files .\nheating naocl solutions up to 60c has been suggested to increase reactivity and antimicrobial and tissue - dissolving action .\nhowever , the increase in reactivity may also enhance the corrosive potential of commercial naocl solutions and adversely affect mechanical properties of ni - ti rotary files . however , there is apparently no consensus whether or not corrosion presents a clinical problem .\nit needs to be pointed out that naocl is not only an indispensable endodontic solution but may be used to decontaminate files during reprocessing before sterilization .\nin addition to the two variables  torque  and  force  that have been used previously to describe the action of endodontic files in rotary motion , in the current study , most of the factors such as rpm , force , canal condition , torque , file type , and strain amplitude that effects file fatigue and failure were significantly controlled and maintained constant in accordance with clinical conditions .\nmuch smaller changes were registered for temperature change for all irrigation conditions , but these values may also reflect canal properties and the reaction of the instrument to the irregularities .\ntherefore , it seems likely that testing conditions in this research were relatively better than cited studies .\nthere was a slight increase in temperature paralleled by a reduction in number of rotation that caused file failure after immersion in naocl .\na possible reason for this effect may be formation of a brittle surface layer during immersion of superelastic ni - ti alloys . under the conditions of this in vitro study , profile rotaries showed a reduction in temperature cause less files failure .\nthere was a high difference in the temperatures generated by the rotary instruments with different solution system , and the changes in temperature were directly related to the amount of wear and solution materials .\nthey can also absorb the heat generated by device to increase the device lifetime . on the other hand ,\nsolution material acts as a heat absorber and increases the life of the instrument and prevents fracture of the instrument .\nnote that increased specimen temperature is one important parameter of fatigue but is not the only factor causing fatigue .\nthe effect of thermal fatigue and creep also could be considered and would be a good subject for future research .\nthe lifetime of ni - ti instruments can be increased by using 5% naocl solution rather than water or air .\nthe number of cycles that instruments can withstand prior to fracture was increased according to solution used during canal preparation .\nthe use of other solution methods like sodium hypochlorite ( 5% ) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) ( 17% ) and their effects on temperature and failure of files could be considered in future researches .\nin conclusion , there appears to be a risk of file failure of ni - ti rotary files without irrigation , especially when non - irrigation conditions are used .\nthe results of the current study suggest that liquid irrigation in fact reduce temperature and act as thermal heat absorber , and naocl irrigation solution is more suitable in comparison with water and air conditions .\nfurthermore , it is clear how wetting properties and phase transformation ability of ni - ti may be affected by the temperature and the application modalities present in this in vivo study .\nmore research is needed to identify suitable lubricants that do decrease the file temperature and that are adequate for different ni - ti instrument size .\nthe effect of other mechanical failure characteristics such as tribology could be considered in future researches ."}

's ( 2011 ) results are all the more important in that they provide perhaps the first compelling demonstration that animals can match features between modalities in a way that is not simply explainable by their picking - up on an amodal stimulus property , such as shape ( as demonstrated by research on the crossmodal transfer of shape information between vision and touch ; e.g. , ettlinger & wilson , 1990 ; meltzoff & borton , 1979 ; parker & easton , 2004 ) , nor are they reducible to the pick - up of some sort of sensory equivalence between , for example , auditory and visual stimulus intensity ( see lewkowicz & lickliter , 1981 ) . that said , ludwig et al . (\n2011 ) are certainly not the first to have looked for such apparently arbitrary crossmodal correspondences in animals : ettlinger ( 1961 ) tried , and failed , to show metaphorical crossmodal matches in monkeys . and while premack and premack ( 2003 , pp 216218 ) make the dramatic claim that monkeys systematically match round to soft and pink , and angular to rough and red in their book on the origins of intelligence , we have been unable to find any independent empirical support for this claim .\nludwig et al . ( 2011 ) argue that there was unlikely to have been any correlation between the dimensions of pitch and brightness in the chimp 's sensory environment . as such\n, they could not have learned this crossmodal association or correspondence : hence the authors came to the dramatic conclusion that such crossmodal matching must be innate .\nsimilar claims for innateness have also been made for certain other crossmodal correspondences ( shepherd , 2012 ) .\nother researchers who are unable to find any obvious environmental source for a particular correspondence between particular sensory features ( or dimensions ) often use the term \nsynaesthetic instead ( here meaning that the correspondence involves a surprising or unexpected pairing of sensory dimensions , e.g. , see walker et al . , 2010 ) rather than calling the phenomenon that they have \ndiscovered a crossmodal correspondence ( spence , 2011 ) or a natural crossmodal mapping ( evans & treisman , 2010 ) .\nthis places one on a slippery slope that leads from the finding that chimpanzees ' behaviour is influenced by a  synaesthestic mapping between the senses to the much broader claim that chimpanzees are synaesthetes . for many researchers ,\nthe latter term primarily refers to rare cases where certain sensory or conceptual inducers elicit idiosyncratic yet consistent , involuntary conscious sensory concurrents ( see deroy & spence , forthcoming ) .\nthe lack of evidence regarding the occurrence of a conscious synaesthetic concurrent should be sufficient to question the appropriateness of applying the term to chimpanzees .\nfurthermore , lewkowicz ( 2011 ) recently articulated the concern held by many researchers that there simply is n't enough genetic material to code all those abilities / behaviours that researchers seemingly want to suggest are innate , including probably crossmodal correspondences .\nit is even doubtful whether we need to posit an innate basis for these correspondences is doubtful given the evidence that at least adults are able to learn novel associations between initially uncorrelated sensory dimensions very rapidly ( ernst , 2007 ) .\nnow where might the crossmodal correspondence between pitch and lightness have been learned ? in most natural environments ,\nhumans and presumably many other species ( e.g. , chimps ) have been shown to internalize such information in terms of a  light - from - above  prior ( adams , graf , & ernst , 2004 ) .\nadd to this the fact that smaller bodies or objects will , generally - speaking , make higher - pitched sounds when struck , sounded , voiced etc .\nthan larger objects , and further that smaller objects are more likely to be found in the sky than large objects ( elephants and whales were presumably never going to fly ) .\nthe suggestion that emerges is that there may indeed be an environmental association between lightness , pitch and size : smaller higher - pitched objects are , statistically - speaking more likely to be located somewhat closer to the source of ambient illumination and hence to be better illuminated and appear visually lighter than larger objects . of course\n, many such suggestions regarding the environmental origins of such  surprising crossmodal correspondences ( see also walker et al . , 2010 ) have something of the unsatisfactory feel of the  just - so  stories popularized by evolutionary psychologists .\nthey are certainly hard to prove without some kind of environmental sampling of the statistics of the natural environment ( see geisler , 2008 , for a review ) .\none other possibility to consider here is that given that crossmodal correspondences are transitive , once the two former statistical regularities are learned ( lightness  size ; size  pitch ) , the mind / brain will also acquire the correspondence between lightness and pitch .\nthe two hypotheses ( direct or indirect acquisition ) might generate different models and predictions . what they both confirm\n, however , is that looking carefully for the environmental source of such surprising correspondences , once demonstrated , may be preferable to many than the alternative claim that such phenomena are innate , or for that matter , that chimps are synaesthetic ."}

median , 29 years ) .\nalthough the scope of this article is limited to mefloquine prophylaxis use in nonimmune travelers , 3 important relevant studies of mefloquine prophylaxis in semi - immune pregnant women warrant mention here .\nthe first study was in 339 semi - immune pregnant thai women ( > 20 weeks of gestation ) , and mefloquine prophylaxis was well tolerated .\nno significant adverse impact was observed on the mother , course of pregnancy , infant survival , or infant development ( up to age 2 years )\n. a higher overall rate of stillbirths was noted for mefloquine users ( 11 in 159 vs 4 in 152 for placebo ) .\nthe authors concluded that mefloquine was safe and effective for antimalarial prophylaxis in the second half of pregnancy .\nthe second study [ 27 , 28 ] in malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment involved semi - immune women in the mangochi district of malawi .\nthe study showed no significant differences in the frequency of abortions or stillbirths in women receiving chloroquine ( n = 3077 ) or mefloquine ( n = 1032 ) prophylaxis during the second and third trimesters . a third study investigating the pharmacokinetics of mefloquine prophylaxis in 20 semi - immune women in the third trimester of pregnancy found no abnormalities in offspring who were followed up until 2 years of age .\nthis study showed increased clearance of mefloquine in late pregnancy , with implications for an increased chemoprophylaxis dosage in the third trimester .\nall other studies focused on nonimmune women who used mefloquine during travel . in 1 evaluation of malaria chemoprophylaxis ,\n331 women exposed to mefloquine were compared with 153 women exposed to sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine .\nfetal anomalies were lower in the mefloquine group ( 4.8% ) than in the sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine group ( 7.8% ) . however , the mefloquine group had a significantly higher proportion of spontaneous abortions ( 9.1% vs 2.6% ) , although this was still within the background rate for the population studied .\nadditional data on the use of mefloquine chemoprophylaxis in nonimmune pregnant women came from a case series of 10 women exposed in the first trimester of pregnancy   ( without malformations ) .\nfurther data are published on us servicewomen   who inadvertently used mefloquine prior to becoming aware of their pregnancy during military operations .\nthey had a high rate of spontaneous abortions , which was attributed to stressors in the combat environment .\nin summary , the prospective data shown here suggest that fetal loss and the birth prevalence of malformations ( 4.39% ) in mefloquine - exposed mothers were comparable to background levels in the general population .\nthis evidence corroborates the recommendation that inadvertent use of mefloquine in pregnancy does not constitute grounds for therapeutic abortions and provides guidance for women and their clinicians regarding the use of mefloquine prophylaxis in the pre- and periconception periods and during pregnancy .\np. s. , w. a. b. , p. s. , l. r. , g. v. d. , m. t. s. , m. s. b. , h. g. r. , and m. a. participated in the conception , design , and planning of the analysis and evaluation of data ;

like receptors are known to promote inflammation , but their role in dry eye has not been fully explored .\ntlr4 expression was found to increase in the conjunctiva in our mouse model of dry eye .\nmoreover , inhibition of tlr4 decreases expression of some inflammatory mediators during experimental de . however , additional research is needed to understand inflammatory mediators associated with tlr4 activation on the ocular surface .\ntheoretically , commensal or pathogenic lps - producing bacteria , as well as endogenous tlr4 ligands , could make a significant contribution to the inflammation observed in dry eye .\nimportantly , gram - negative bacterial sequences have been found in the normal ocular microbiome .\nendogenous tlr4 ligands are thought to include extracellular matrix breakdown components , fibrinogen cleavage products , and heat shock proteins .\nheat shock protein 70 has been linked to de , but the presence of other endogenous tlr4 ligands has not yet been fully investigated .\npotentially , disruption of ocular surface homeostasis in dry eye could lead to generation of endogenous tlr4 ligands . despite this possibility\n, the ability of tlr4 to produce a proinflammatory response in the eye during normal and diseased states has not been fully explored .\nthis study indicates that tlr4 is present on the eye and that tlr4 activation can lead to increased production of proinflammatory mediators .\nin fact , lps application to the ocular surface can lead to the release of several inflammatory mediators linked to dry eye .\nthe greatest variety of inflammatory mediators and most dramatic rises in gene expression were noted in the conjunctiva ( fig .\nthis was expected , as the greater permeability of the conjunctival epithelium may make tlr4-positive cells more accessible to lps than in the cornea .\nil-6 is one proinflammatory cytokine that was expressed in the conjunctiva after lps treatment ( fig .\nadditionally , tnf- appeared to increase in a dose - dependent manner , though it did not reach statistical significance .\ntnf- is also important in th17 differentiation and has been shown to stimulate mmp-9 production in vitro , which can lead to further corneal epithelial disease .\nboth il-6 and tnf- have been found to be increased in mouse models of dry eye and in humans with the disease .\nin addition to generating th17 pathway cytokines , lps administration also led to mediators associated with the th1 response .\nifn- is the defining cytokine of the th1 response , which contributes to ocular surface disease and tear dysfunction .\nupregulation of ifn- by lps is important as ifn- expression is increased in mice and humans with de .\nfurthermore , ifn- has been linked to goblet cell loss and is capable of inducing apoptosis in the conjunctival epithelium .\nincreased production of ifn- after treatment with lps is also significant , in part , because of the ability of ifn- to amplify the immune response .\nifn- increases production of th1 chemokines ( cxcl9 , cxcl10 , and cxcl11 ) , which , in turn , attract greater numbers of ifn-producing cells .\nalso , ifn- increases expression of cd80 and cd86 on dendritic cells , which is required for t cell activation .\nfinally , ifn- leads to increased il-12 receptor expression . interestingly , il-12a , the main cytokine responsible for th1 differentiation , was also significantly upregulated in the conjunctiva after lps stimulation ( fig .\n2 ) . upregulation of il-12a , in conjunction with ifn- , suggests lps stimulation can promote the th1 response that is critical to dry eye pathology .\nit is particularly interesting that application of lps to non - stressed mice leads to production of inflammatory mediators in the cornea ( fig .\nthere are some conflicting findings in the literature as to whether or not human corneal epithelial cells can respond to lps in vitro .\nfigure 5 demonstrates cultured mouse cornea epithelial cells do respond to lps in vitro . in vivo ,\nthis study suggests that normal , unwounded mouse corneas can also respond to tlr4 activation in vivo . in the cornea ( and conjunctiva ) , lps administration significantly increased expression of cxcl10 and il-1 in ns mice ( fig .\n1 ) . both the cxcl10 protein and mrna are known to increase in a mouse model of dry eye . increased cxcl10 expression has also been found in human dry eye .\nsimilarly , il-1 , a proinflammatory cytokine , is increased in mice with experimental dry eye and in humans with the disease .\nblockade of il-1 pathways during dry eye has been shown to be efficacious in murine models of de . in the end\n, lps was found to enhance expression of cytokines and chemokines on a nonstressed ocular surface , which demonstrates that tlr4 activation could contribute to homeostatic immune surveillance .\nthe cell culture studies demonstrate that mouse cornea and conjunctiva epithelial cells , as well as dendritic cells , can respond to lps on the ocular surface .\nthe production of inflammatory mediators observed in the in vivo studies may be from a combination of direct and indirect stimulation .\nfigure 5 suggests that direct activation of epithelial and dendritic cells by lps is possible .\nindirect stimulation of epithelial cells by lps - stimulated dcs ( or other immune cells ) may also contribute to production of proinflammatory mediators .\nfigure 5 demonstrates that il-1 and tnf- , both of which may stimulate additional mediator release from epithelial cells , were upregulated in lps - stimulated dc culture .\nindeed , il-1 has been shown to increase production of il-1 and il-6 in limbal epithelial stem cells , and tnf- has been shown to increase cxcl10 production in human corneal epithelial cells .\nalthough lps stimulation can lead to inflammation in a normal eye , this study suggests that tlr4 activation is enhanced during dry eye disease .\nfigures 4 and 6 display increased expression of il-1 in the cornea after lps administration when mice are exposed to ds .\nthis finding supports our hypothesis that disruption of the corneal epithelial barrier during de leads to greater exposure of tlr4 located in the wing and basal layers of the corneal epithelium .\ntlr4 is then more accessible in the cornea , leading to greater activation by lps .\ndisruption of the corneal epithelial barrier has been established in our mouse model . however , other mechanisms are still a possibility , including increased cell surface expression of tlr4 in the corneal epithelium during de\n. nevertheless , enhanced expression of il-1 in the cornea during de after lps stimulation may impact clinical severity . for instance , il-1 has been shown to upregulate mmp-9 , which can lead to disruption of the corneal epithelium . in turn\n, this could lead to even greater exposure of tlr4 and contribute to a damaging inflammatory cycle .\nsurprisingly , figure 6 also shows that lps administration during de increases expression of il-12a in the conjunctiva .\nmore research needs to be conducted to assess the biological activity of il-35 on the ocular surface .\nupregulation of il-12 by lps may indicate that tlr4 activation could be important in the early stages of dry eye disease .\nmicrobial stress may lead to enhanced release of il-12 at the initiation of de , amplifying the intensity of the disease .\ntlr4 stimulation could potentiate the induction of the de immune response by changing the cytokine milieu and activating th1-polarizing dendritic cells .\nadditional research is needed to determine the mechanism behind the increase in il-12a . in theory\nconsidering this , increased sensitivity of those cell types to lps during ds is a possibility that needs further investigation . in conclusion\n, this study demonstrates that not only is tlr4 capable of producing a proinflammatory response on the ocular surface but that response is enhanced during de disease .\ntlr4 activation during de appears to be important , especially in the initial stages of de . in the cornea , disruption of\nin the conjunctiva , enhanced expression of il-12a after tlr4 activation may promote th1 differentiation , leading to more severe disease .\nthe role of commensal bacteria and endogenous tlr4 ligands in activation of tlr4 during de also needs further exploration . despite this , the proinflammatory reactions produced by tlr4 on the ocular surface illustrate that tlr4 is a potential pharmaceutical target for dry eye inflammation ."}

{"id": 52, "text": "excessive use of tobacco has led to a pandemic - like situation all over the globe .\nthe world health organization estimates that for every 6 s , somebody dies from a tobacco - related disease globally , and this deadly habit is mainly learnt at home . the socio - environmental factors prevailing at home have been identified as one of the important causes of adopting smoking and other types of smokeless tobacco .\nidentification of predictors for the initiation of tobacco use is essential to curb the issue . like genetically linked disease run in families ,\ntobacco users in families also tend to influence their siblings and relatives for initiation of tobacco .\nrole of family covers a bigger arena than society , peers , and other reasons for the initiation of tobacco use . the first lesson of smoking and tobacco consumption is usually learnt at home from a parent or a grown - up sibling , especially if the habit is acquired at an early age before 18 years .\nreports have shown that initiation of tobacco use during adolescence causes more tobacco dependence . during their formative phase ,\nkids who see their parents , elders , and siblings smoking or chewing tobacco become inquisitive , and their minds get primed and conditioned to initiate smoking , at quite a young age .\nonce the habit of tobacco consumption is acquired at young age , it is difficult to get rid of it because of its addictive nature .\none not only inherits the habit of smoking from parents / elders , but also passes on the baton to the next generation .\nalthough several nation - wide prevalence studies such as the national family health survey and global adult tobacco survey report the proportion of population using tobacco products in india , role of family has not been discussed much . moreover ,\nthe degree of inheritance of smoking practices from parents and further continuation in those practices in the offspring has not been studied previously .\nstudy on

tobacco use by parents .\nthis study is one of the few studies which has studied the entire spectrum of tobacco habit in three generations that included bidi smoking , cigarette smoking , and use of smokeless tobacco or both .\nfor example , a teenager will think twice before smoking in front of his parents , but will not hesitate to chew gutka or pan masala . in some cases , parents may also share the smokeless form of tobacco with siblings and offspring . among tobacco habits , chewing tobacco , consuming pan masala , gutka , and other smokeless tobacco are socially sanctioned behavior .\ntherefore , its control is more difficult compared to smoking , which is seen as contempt by elders .\nhowever , when parents smoke or use tobacco products , they are not in a position to restrain their offspring .\ntobacco and alcohol addictive habits are reported to be acquired at an early age in family surroundings . in our study\nour study also reveals that increased frequency of drinking was also associated with tobacco use .\nozawa et al . also observed that an increase in drinking frequency resulted in less likelihood of smoking cessation .\nthis finding raises an issue that with the growing percentage of tobacco use , alcohol intake will also increase and vice versa .\ntherefore , the need is to address both the issues together . in our study ,\n45.5% of the patients were tobacco users and 81% of those who were using tobacco had a positive family history .\nparents generally have much longer and more frequent contact with their children than any peer claiming to have influence over them\n. most parents usually remain throughout one 's adolescence , while peers or best friends change frequently .\ndone on 3000 high school children also found that incidence of smoking among high school students significantly correlated with the incidence of smoking among family members ( p < 0.001 ) . in another study , talay and altin have also observed that smoking rates seem to be influenced by smoking habits of family members .\n. use of smokeless tobacco among parents and their effect on siblings and offspring has not been described much by western authors ; the reason being smokeless tobacco is mainly consumed in the indian subcontinent .\nozawa et al . found that paternal and maternal smoking had a significant impact on whether or not a child would quit smoking as compared to a child that had paternal and maternal nonsmokers .\nshamsuddin and haris and dwivedi et al . also showed that effect of the father 's smoking habit on the child 's current smoking habit is significant , even after controlling for other familial and nonfamilial factors , including parental supervision , academic performance , reported influence of cigarette advertisement , and having friends who smoked .\nour study also showed that among tobacco users , 65.8% reportedly had a history of tobacco use by fathers .\nbders in a review has suggested that parental influence might include other factors such as parents approval or disapproval of smoking , their involvement in free time supervision , their manner , and extent of communication on health - related issues .\nthe most dominant role is played by mother in early initiation of smoking or tobacco use by offspring .\nthe logic behind such hypothesis is that if a mother has been smoking , the fetus passively inhales nicotine and carbon monoxide through placenta while in mother 's womb . soon after delivery\n, the baby is again subjected to passive smoking while in the lap of the mother during breastfeeding or otherwise . the visual impact on brain during immediate neonatal period ,\ni.e. , seeing one 's own mother smoking , is something which has not been studied extensively , but one can safely surmise that such children will emulate smoking much earlier than those whose mothers have not been smoking during pregnancy and subsequent period .\nit has also been observed that the brain of the fetus whose mother is a smoker gets primed for nicotine craving and smoking during their adolescence .\nthe resultant effect is that most offspring of such parents would adopt smoking early and be the victims of premature coronary artery disease and other tobacco - related diseases .\nthe combined ill - effect of maternal smoking / passive smoking is not only epigenetic and priming to the fetus , but also adventurous and fascinating , finally resulting in addictive habit as early as 6 or 7 years of age .\noverall , maternal smoking was more strongly associated with youths regular smoking than paternal smoking in the present study .\nthese results suggest that efforts to decrease the burden of tobacco smoking among youths may be more efficient if focused on families rather than on individuals .\n, we could only interview patients who had come to the clinic and history of tobacco use in siblings or parents , and offspring could only be elicited by asking them ; therefore , there can be recall bias .\nthe study was a hospital - based study , so the participants may not be representative of the general population .\nthe results of this study expand our understanding of the influence of parental tobacco use and intergenerational transmission of this habit .\nthe study also throws light on how tobacco users in the family tend to influence offspring and siblings .\nan attempt has been made to quantify the degree of intergenerational transmission of tobacco habit .\nthe data provide an exact estimate of the burden of tobacco use by an individual that can be attributed to tobacco use habits of the parents . a deeper understanding of this transmission of tobacco use will provide further insight into the avenues of prevention , in particular , family - based interventions and those that emphasize assisting parents in cessation efforts that will not only reduce the parent 's use , but also likely reduce uptake of tobacco use in subsequent generations .\nthe study also addresses the fact that problem of tobacco use and alcohol use needs to be targeted together to bring a gigantic change in lifestyle diseases .\nprevious anti - smoking campaigns have concentrated much of their effort on discouraging individuals from smoking with the aim of creating a nonsmoking generation .\nthis approach does not take sufficient account of the fact , reconfirmed by our findings that children are influenced by the behavior and attitudes of adults , especially their parents .\nthe most effective way to stop children smoking may be to discourage smoking among adults in the family .\nfuture health education efforts should not consider children in isolation , but rather as a part of a society in which smokeless tobacco and tobacco smoking is still an acceptable adult behavior . there are no conflicts of interest ."}

{"id": 54, "text": "pfeiffer syndrome ( ps ) is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder , originally described by pfeiffer in 1964 , and is characterized by an acrocephalic skull , regressed midface , syndactyly of hands and feet , and broad thumbs and big toes , with a wide range of variable severity ( 1 - 3 ) .\nps is known to be caused by mutations in exons iiia or iiic of the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( fgfr ) 2 or fgfr 1 gene ( 4 - 7 ) .\nwe report with a review of literature the first neonate in korea with ps who had bicoronal craniosynostosis , bilateral syndactyly of the fingers and toes , and broad thumbs and big toes .\na girl was delivered by spontaneous normal vaginal delivery at 38 weeks gestation after an unremarkable pregnancy .\nshe was 3.5 kg in weight ( 25 -

dimensional reconstruction ct showed 3-dimensional virtual images of the bilaterally fused coronal sutures ( fig .\n2a ) but that the sagittal and lambdoid suture were open more than normal to compensate for the small intracranial space , and resulting overall in a brachycephalic head shape ( fig .\nplain radiography of her hands and feet showed no bony fusion between the phalanges ( fig .\nthree - dimensional ct image of choanal air airway showed small and narrow airway of choanal space ( fig .\n4 ) . she did not have any visceral abnormality upon ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and heart .\nthe patient had a decompressive endoscopic tunnel craniectomy at 4 weeks of age , and is planned for second surgical correction of craniosynostosis , followed by additional correction procedure for the finger and craniofacial anomalies at a later date .\nthe exact incidence of ps is unknown , but is expected to be 1 in every 100,000 births in the western population , and approximately 60 cases to date have been reported in the past world - wide literature ( 8 , 9 ) .\nhowever , it is rarer in asian population : only several cases were reported in japan ( 10 , 11 ) and no reports as yet in korea .\ncohen ( 12 ) in 1993 classified this syndrome into 3 clinical subtypes and suggested that these subtypes might not be classified as separate entities , even though these classifications have important diagnostic and prognostic implications .\ntype 2 consists of a cloverleaf skull with pfeiffer hands and feet , together with ankylosis of the elbows .\n3 ps , ocular proptosis is severe , and the anterior cranial base is markedly short .\nearly demise is characteristic of both types 2 and 3 , which to date has been reported to occur only as sporadic cases ( 7 , 9 ) .\nclinical manifestations of this patient appeared to fit into subtype 1 according to cohen 's clinical classification of ps .\nthe etiology for this syndrome is autosomal dominant or fresh mutations in type i conditions , and sporadic in types ii and iii .\nsome cases are linked to mutations at the fgfr 1 gene at chromosome 8p11.22-p12 ( 4 ) .\nmutations at the fgfr2 gene , which map at chromosome 10q25-q26 , have also been reported recently ( 9 ) .\nthese mutations are related to the old age of parents , especially the father , because these mutations are suspected to confer a selective advantage to survival of sperm ( 13 ) .\nusually , the parents are not affected and the risk for future children of that couple is minimal .\nthe offspring of a patient with ps have a 50 - 60% chance of inheriting the syndrome due to the dominant characteristics of this gene .\nps may involve craniosynostosis that is most often of the coronal and lambdoid , and occasionally sagittal sutures . a severe form of craniosynostosis in the ps is kleebattschdel ( cloverleaf anomaly ) .\nthe abnormal skull shape could result in a small intracranial volume that increases intracranial pressure , which might be commonly presented as headaches or visual changes .\nsome children with ps may have only one or both mid - face problems and craniosynostosis .\nthe most common features of the face are regressed mid - face and shallow orbits , which may be present at birth but sometimes become more evident as the childhood progresses .\nunderdeveloped maxillary bone of the face results in very shallow orbits and exophthalmos or proptosis .\nthe shallow orbits and proptosis may lead to damage of the cornea from dryness , or exposure keratosis .\nmaxillary hypoplasia also results in a small larynx and pharynx behind the nose and mouth .\nthis restricts the passage of air into the trachea and lungs and causes respiratory distress , particularly at night when snoring and snuffling can interrupt sleep .\nsimilarly , the passage of food is restricted , and regurgitation may result in aspiration of food into the lungs .\n( 14 ) in 1990 described an infant with ps in whom the trachea showed replacement of the cartilaginous rings by a solid cartilaginous plate extending the full length of the trachea and beyond the carina resulting in tracheal stenosis .\nsome other features commonly seen in these patients are visual disturbances related to an imbalance of the muscle that move the eyes and hearing loss due to recurrent ear infections .\nvallino - napoli ( 15 ) in 1996 reviewed the audiologic and otologic features of 9 patients with ps , ranging in age from 2 to 12 yr .\nseven patients had conductive hearing loss and 1 had mixed loss ; none had purely sensorineural loss .\nprimary ct findings were stenosis and/or atresia of the external auditory canal , hypoplasia of the middle ear cavity , and an enlarged middle ear cavity .\n( 3 ) reported upper airway compromise in three of four patients with ps type 2 , and five of seven patients with ps type 3 , and cited this as the cause of death in two cases .\nmccarthy et al . ( 16 ) found upper airway anomalies in 5 of 15 patients with ps of unspecified severity , and these were the primary cause of death in two patients .\ncongenital anomalies of the upper airway are clearly an important cause of morbidity and mortality in ps type 2 and 3 but are rare in ps type 1 ( 14 ) .\nthe hands and feet in ps are involved to variable degree ( 17 - 19 ) .\n. patient may have mild soft tissue webbing of syndactyly between the second , third , and fourth digits of either or both hands and feet .\nthe digits may be short and misshapen . whilst the fusion of the fingers and toes in apert syndrome always involves fusion of the soft tissues of the second , third and fourth digits ,\nthis manifestation is similar with ps , but often there is fusion of the bones as well as soft tissues in apert syndrome ( 17 ) .\nother anomalies in ps could include a cleft palate , choanal atresia , tracheo- and broncho - malacia , cloverleaf skull , fused vertebrae , arnold - chiari malformation , hydrocephalus , and imperforate anus .\nthe above case presented by authors is in accordance with type 1 ps because the infant had a craniosynostosis only of bilateral coronal suture and demonstrated broad and radially deviated bilateral thumbs and big toes that are characteristic of ps , even though she also had syndactyly of the bilateral 2nd , 3rd and 4th fingers only with soft tissue webbing .\nthe diagnosis of the apert syndrome is appropriate rather than ps if a patient has broad thumbs and syndactyly with bony fusion ( 17 ) or syndactyly of the second , third and fourth web spaces ( 19 ) .\nhowever , clinical differential diagnosis has been confusing until now in relation with genetic findings because pfeiffer mutation has been reported to occur in a patient with apert syndrome ( 20 ) , and identical mutations in the fgfr2 gene could cause both ps and crouzon syndrome phenotypes ( 21 ) as illustrated by the demonstration of both phenotypes of apert and of ps in experimental mice ( 22 ) .\nsome authors have attempted to revise the classification for apert , carpenter , crouzon , jackson - weiss , pfeiffer and saethre - chotzen syndromes on a genetic basis . because of widely intermingling of phenotypic expressions or genetic sharing of the same mutation , as yet there is no definite evidence that phenotypic expressions correlate accurately with genetic mutations ( 10 , 20 - 24 ) .\nthis is probably because the gene that controls these expressions has not been elucidated to date ( 25 ) .\nthe prognosis depends on the severity of associated anomalies , mainly the severity of the central nervous system compromise .\npatients with types 2 and 3 usually expire early in infant or childhood even though some may survive with aggressive medical and surgical management ( 5 ) .\nmultiple staged surgeries are the general treatment plan for patients with ps . in the first year of life\nit is preferred to release the synostotic sutures of the skull to allow adequate cranial volume and thus allowing for brain growth and expansion . in this patient\n, we performed a decompressive endoscopic craniectomy at 4 weeks of age for decompression of the high intracranial pressure due to coronal synostosis and maxillary hypoplasia .\nsecondary decompressive skull remodeling is planned at 4 - 6 months of age , and additional skull expansion surgery would be repeated as the child grows to about 2 or 3 yr of age .\nalthough significant malformation of the fingers and toes are present , usually these function adequately and do not require the surgical correction .\nhowever , this patient had soft tissue webbing between the fingers and toes , and thus will require surgical dividing procedure after infancy for future active physical therapy .\nmid - facial advancement may be performed in order to provide an adequate orbital volume and reduce the exophthalmos , and to correct the dental occlusion to achieve appropriate functional position , but these procedures are not common in patients with ps .\nthis patient also had severe choanal hypoplasia with respiratory distress from maxillary hypoplasia that will be corrected with mid - facial advancement at 5 - 6 yr of age ."}

term dietary supplementation of kaempferol ( 0.01% or 0.05% in the diet ) in middle - aged mice fed a hf diet .\nthe hf diet decreased the accumulative average food intake , but kaempferol supplementation for 5  mo did not alter the food consumption compared with hf diet - fed mice ( figure 1(a ) ) .\nhowever , dietary intake of 0.05% kaempferol significantly ameliorated hf diet - induced body weight gain ( figure 1(b ) ) .\nconsistently , mice fed the hf diet developed obesity as determined by measuring their relative percentage of fat ( figure 1(c ) ) and muscle mass ( figure 1(d ) ) .\nhowever , kaempferol treatment had no significant effect on adiposity of obese mice . fasting blood levels of cholesterol ( figure 1(e ) ) , ldl - cholesterol ( figure 1(f ) ) , and triglyceride ( figure 1(g ) ) were increased in hf diet - fed obese mice , which were significantly reduced by dietary intake of kaempferol . however , total cholesterol levels in kaempferol - fed mice were still significantly higher as compared to chow diet - fed mice .\nfasting plasma hdl - cholesterol concentrations were increased by hf feeding but were not further altered by kaempferol treatment ( figure 1(h ) ) . in another study to determine whether kaempferol also improves metabolism and health of sd diet - fed older adult mice , we found that dietary intake of either 0.01% kaempferol ( k1 ) or 0.05% kaempferol ( k2 ) for 3  mo had no effects on body weight gain ( 5.9  0.5 , 6.1  0.4 , and 6.0  0.6  g for control , k1 , and k2 group , resp . ) , food intake ( 4.25 , 4.27 , and 4.23  g / d / mouse ) , fasting ( 136.4  4.1 , 131.6  3.4 , and 127.9  5.8  mg / dl ) and nonfasting ( 185.4  11.1 , 180.5  5.5 , and 174.4  12.2 ) blood glucose levels , glucose tolerance ( 32672  1653 , 31411  1582 , and 31078  1634 auc ) , and insulin sensitivity ( 11073  1065 , 10897  9887 , and 10574  1141 auc ) .\nafter 2  mo of hf diet consumption , mice displayed hyperglycemia throughout this study , as shown by persistently over 50% higher circulating glucose levels as compared with mice that consumed the sd diet .\nkaempferol supplementation at this point nonsignificantly reduced the hf diet - induced rise in blood glucose .\nafter 3  mo , however , mice fed hf diet supplemented with kaempferol exhibited significantly lower blood glucose levels than those in hf - fed mice ; after 5  mo of treatment , mice fed kaempferol - supplemented diet still had significantly lower blood glucose levels ( 140  10.5  mg / dl ) as compared to hf diet - fed mice ( 197  10.5  mg / dl ) , which were almost reduced to the levels shown in sd - fed mice ( 123.0  4.8  mg / dl ) ( figure 2(a ) ) .\ndata showed that kaempferol ( 0.05% in the diet ) nonsignificantly improved glucose tolerance as demonstrated by lower blood glucose levels at 30 and 60  min ( figure 2(b ) ) as well as reduced auc ( figure 2(c ) ) following ip glucose injection compared to hf - fed mice .\nconsistently , blood levels of hba1c , which reflect an average of blood glucose over a period of two to three mo , were significantly lower in kaempferol - treated mice as compared to those in hf diet - fed mice ( figure 2(d ) ) .\ninsulin resistance is important to the etiology of t2d and usually occurs in obesity . to determine if dietary intake of kaempferol improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice , we performed an ip itt .\nhowever , dietary provision of kaempferol as low as 0.01% significantly improved plasma glucose levels ( figure 2(e ) ) and the auc ( figure 2(f ) ) postinsulin injection in hf diet - fed mice , suggesting that kaempferol increases insulin sensitivity .\nwe observed that fasting plasma insulin levels in hf mice were about 6-fold of those in mice that received the sd diet , suggesting that obese mice are insulin resistant ( figure 2(g ) ) .\nhowever , plasma insulin levels in 0.05% kaempferol - treated mice were more than 50% lower as compared with hf - fed obese mice ( figure 2(g ) )\n. these data strongly suggest that long - term kaempferol supplementation maintained whole body insulin sensitivity in hf diet - induced obese mice .\ninsulin resistance in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle , the primary site of glucose and fatty acid utilization , plays a major role in the development of hf diet - induced t2d . to further determine the molecular events that are associated with improved insulin sensitivity by kaempferol treatment , we measured the expression of ampk and glut4 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues , which are two critical molecules regulating glucose uptake [ 30 , 31 ] .\nconsistent with impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity , the expression of ampk and glut4 proteins in both skeletal muscle ( figures 3(a)3(c ) ) and adipose tissue ( figures 3(d)3(f ) ) from hf diet - fed mice was significantly attenuated as compared to the control mice . however , treatment with kaempferol completely reversed these detrimental effects caused by feeding the mice with hf diet ( figures 3(a)3(f ) ) .\nthese results further confirmed that long - term intake of kaempferol protects against developing insulin resistance in hf diet - induced obese mice .\nas skeletal muscle is the major site for fuel metabolism , and obesity and insulin resistance are always accompanied with the impairment in energy metabolism , a leading pathogenic factor for t2d , we performed a series of in vitro assays to determine whether kaempferol has direct beneficial effects on glucose metabolism . in that regard , we cultured skeletal muscle cells with or without kaempferol in the presence of palmitate and oleic acid .\nwe found that exposure of c2c12 myotubes to high fatty acids for 24  h impaired insulin - induced glucose uptake ( figure 4(a ) ) and glycogen synthesis ( figure 4(b ) ) .\nhowever , these detrimental effects were partially reversed by treatment with 10  m kaempferol ( figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) ) . to further characterize metabolic and insulin sensitizing effects of kaempferol\n, we cultured skeletal muscle cells with or without kaempferol in the presence of high glucose ( 20  mm ) and saturated fatty acid palmitate ( 0.5  mm ) , an in vitro environment that is frequently used to simulate diabetic condition in vivo .\nthe results showed that kaempferol at physiologically relevant concentrations significantly improved lipolysis ( figure 5(a ) ) and reversed high fatty acid - impaired ampk activity ( figure 5(b ) ) and glut4 protein expression ( figure 5(c ) ) , a downstream target of activated ampk . while peripheral insulin resistance is common during obesity in rodents and people , its progression to t2d is largely due to insulin secretory dysfunction and significant apoptosis of functional -cells [ 48 ] , leading to an inability to compensate for insulin resistance .\npast studies have established that sustained hyperlipidemia in obese individuals plays an important role in causing -cell apoptosis and dysfunction , thereby contributing to the deterioration of glycemic control and the overt development of t2d [ 2224 ] .\nwe recently found that kaempferol treatment prevented apoptosis of cultured pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic hyperlipidemic condition .\nwe therefore further assessed whether kaempferol can also protect pancreatic -cell function , thereby preventing diabetes by using a t2d mouse model that was generated through a combination of hf diet feeding and three consecutive injections of low doses of stz . regarding this , c57bl/6 mice ( male , 10-month - old ) were fed a sd diet , a hf diet , or hf diet containing 0.05% kaempferol .\nconsistent with the observations from the animal study described above , treatment with kaempferol for 6  weeks had no effect on body weight gain , food intake , fasting blood glucose levels , glucose intolerance , or insulin resistance of mice fed the hf diet ( data not shown ) .\nafter 6  weeks of dietary treatment , stz ( 40  mg / kg bw ) was administrated ( ip ) for 3 consecutive days to induce diabetes mediated by a destruction of islet -cells in mice .\nour data showed that dietary ingestion of kaempferol significantly mitigated stz - induced hyperglycemia in diabetic mice as determined by measuring fasting ( figure 6(a ) ) and nonfasting ( figure 6(b ) ) blood glucose levels . consistently , kaempferol ameliorated the loss of body weight secondary to the development of diabetes   ( data not shown ) . to determine\nif the improved glycemic control in mice fed the kaempferol - supplemented diet is the result of preserved islet function , we measured insulin levels in the plasma of the control and kaempferol - fed mice .\nas shown in figure 6(c ) , plasma insulin levels in mice fed diet containing kaempferol were significantly greater as compared to those in nontreated diabetic mice , suggesting that kaempferol may ameliorate hyperglycemia primarily via preserving islet -cell function .\nsince stz causes diabetes by destroying islet -cells , we then examined whether kaempferol treatment preserved -cell mass in diabetic mice by using an immunohistochemical technique .\nwe observed that hf diet - fed mice exhibited greater pancreas weight as compared with the control mice ( figure 7(a ) ) , which was not modulated by kaempferol supplementation ( figure 7(a ) ) .\nhowever , stz administration caused severe destruction of pancreatic -cells as determined by evaluating the area of insulin positive cells ( figure 7(b ) ) and islet mass ( figure 7(c ) ) , which consequently led to the reduction of pancreatic insulin content by nearly 80% ( figure 7(d ) ) .\nhowever , dietary provision of kaempferol partially preserved islet -cell mass ( figures 7(b ) and 7(c ) ) and insulin content ( figure 7(d ) ) in diabetic mice .\nit has been reported that kaempferol elicits a number of health benefits , including antioxidative [ 17 , 37 ] , anti - inflammatory [ 18 , 38 ] , antihypertensive [ 39 , 40 ] , lipolytic [ 19 , 41 ] , and anticarcinogenic effects [ 20 , 21 , 42 ] .\nhowever , studies on whether this compound possesses antidiabetic properties are very limited . in this study , we tested the antidiabetic potential of this natural compound by using two mouse models and in vitro studies .\nit is worthy to note that , unlike many metabolic studies that used young adult mice , we used near middle - aged mice , which may be more clinically relevant , as t2d in humans often occurs during middle and late ages .\nwe provide evidence that long - term dietary intake of kaempferol promoted metabolic homeostasis with the improved fasting blood glucose , hba1c levels , insulin sensitivity , and glucose tolerance in hf diet - induced obese mice , which was associated with increased fuel metabolism , ampk activity , and glut4 expression in skeletal muscle cells .\nfurther , dietary kaempferol also ameliorates hyperglycemia in stz - induced diabetic mice by preserving functional -cell mass .\nimportantly , these beneficial metabolic effects , elicited by dietary intake of kaempferol , are not due to alteration in food intake . given that both insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and progressive -cell loss and dysfunction are key components in the pathogenesis of t2d [ 48 ] , kaempferol could be a low - cost and safe natural compound to promote energy metabolism and maintain glucose homeostasis by targeting these two defects .\nit is well established that obesity is an important risk factor for t2d [ 43 , 44 ] .\ntherefore , hf diets are commonly used as a strategy to induce obesity in animal models , leading to the development of metabolic disorders including hyperlipidemia , impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance , and elevated blood insulin and glucose [ 4548 ] .\nconsistently , our data showed that consumption of the hf diet induced obesity and elevated plasma concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol that are typical of obesity , which however were ameliorated in mice fed a hf diet containing kaempferol . given that obesity is a leading pathogenic factor for developing insulin resistance and subsequent glucose intolerance\n, the improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis by kaempferol supplementation could be partially due to the secondary effects whereby long - term intake of kaempferol ameliorated obesity in mice fed a hf diet . while it is presently unclear how kaempferol affects lipid metabolism and body weight gain , previous studies demonstrated that several structurally similar flavonoids inhibit lipid absorption and lipogenesis [ 5052 ] . because food intake was not affected by long - term kaempferol supplementation , the decrease in fasting plasma cholesterol and triglycerides in the hf - fed mice could be caused by the regulation of the intestinal digestion and absorption of lipids and/or lipogenesis , which needs further investigation .\nas kaempferol treatment did not alter calorie intake in mice during the course of this study , it is also possible that the reduced body fat mass as well as body weight in kaempferol - fed mice is due to its effect on energy expenditure , given that obesity results from energy imbalance .\nseveral lines of evidence have shown that pharmacological activation of ampk improves blood glucose homeostasis and lipid profile in insulin - resistant rodents .\nampk is an energy sensing molecule highly conserved from yeast to all animals , which is increasingly recognized as a master regulator of whole body energy homeostasis .\nampk is a heterotrimeric protein kinase composed of a catalytic subunit ( ampk ) and two regulatory subunits (  and  ) that sense low cellular energy levels by monitoring changes in the amp  :  atp ratio .\namp binding to the  subunit induces a conformational change that allows ampk to be phosphorylated at its threonine residue ( thr 172 ) by the ampk - activating protein kinase ( lkb1 ) . at the whole body level\n, ampk integrates stress responses , nutrient and hormonal signals to the control of food intake , energy expenditure , and substrate utilization . at the cellular level ,\nactivated ampk inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis , promotes fatty acid oxidation , and regulates mitochondrial biogenesis .\nin addition , activation of ampk increases glut4 expression and membrane translocation in skeletal muscle , thereby improving glucose uptake .\nconsistent with the impaired insulin sensitivity in hf - fed obese mice , we found that the protein levels of ampk and glut4 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from these animals were also considerably attenuated .\nhowever , these detrimental effects were completely reversed by supplementation of 0.05% kaempferol in the hf diet .\nthese results suggest that kaempferol may increase peripheral insulin sensitivity via the ampk - mediated pathway .\nboth in experimental animals and people , obesity - related insulin resistance is always associated with the dysfunctions of several metabolic pathways including reduced lipolysis , fatty acid oxidation , glucose uptake , and glycogen synthesis coupled with increased glucose output .\nspecifically , it is believed that elevated intramyocellular lipid accumulation coupled with diminished lipolysis and mitochondrial lipid oxidation play a role in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle .\nconsistently , it was found that inducing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in muscle cells protects against lipotoxicity - induced insulin resistance [ 58 , 59 ] . in the present study\n, we further showed that kaempferol treatment as low as 1  m augmented lipolysis and reversed chronic hyperlipidemia - impaired glucose uptake , glut4 expression , ampk activity , and glycogenesis in skeletal muscle cells , which provides further evidence at cellular levels that kaempferol might be an insulin sensitizing molecule by promoting energy metabolism .\nhowever , it is presently unclear how kaempferol exerts these beneficial effects in skeletal muscle cells .\nkaempferol has been shown to possess antioxidant property . while we found that pharmacological doses of kaempferol ( 1050  m ) showed significant free radical scavenging activity as evaluated by using an oxygen radical absorbance assay , it had no such effect at 1  m\n. therefore , kaempferol promotion of skeletal muscle cell function may not be due to its potential antioxidant effect .\nwe further explored whether kaempferol directly protects pancreatic -cell function in vivo by using a nongenetic mouse model of t2d , which was generated by employing a combination of feeding a hf diet and administering three mild doses ( 40  mg / kg ) of stz that does not cause diabetes in chow - fed mice , as demonstrated in our recent study .\nthis nongenetic diabetic mouse model manifests the metabolic characteristics of human t2d , including moderate levels of hyperglycemia , hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance , impaired insulin secretion , and reduced -cell mass .\nthe results in the present study show that kaempferol partially preserved -cell mass in stz - induced diabetic mice , which could be primarily attributable to its antidiabetic action , given that diabetes was induced before kaempferol caused changes in body weight , adiposity , or other metabolic parameters .\nwe speculate that kaempferol treatment may protect against -cell apoptosis , thereby improving islet mass , given our recent observations that kaempferol promotes viability of isolated pancreatic islets exposed to chronic hyperglycemia   or hyperlipidemia . in summary , we provide evidence that long - term dietary supplementation of kaempferol prevents hf diet - induced metabolic disorders in middle - aged obese mice . on cellular and molecular levels\n, kaempferol improves glycolysis , glucose uptake , glycogen synthesis , ampk activity , and glut4 expression in skeletal muscle .\nin addition , dietary supplementation of kaempferol significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and preserved functional islet mass in old adult obese diabetic mice .\nthese results indicate that phytonutrient kaempferol may be used as a dietary supplement to prevent metabolic disorders that are associated with obesity and aging ."}

group of malignant tumor cells having clear cytoplasm beside pancreatic ducts lined by columnar cells having bland basal nuclei ( h and e , mp )\nclear cell rccs are famous for their ability to metastasize to unusual sites , may be several years after resection of the primary tumor . indeed , so - called late metastases ( later than 10 years ) are a relatively well - encountered phenomenon with renal cell cancers .\nthere was a case report of pancreatic metastasis 23 years after nephrectomy for rcc.6 the pancreas is a rare site of solitary metastasis , but it is often involved in diffuse metastatic disease.78 in a large published series , metastasis from primary rcc to the pancreas made up from 0.25% to 3% of all resected pancreatic specimens.89 in a study comparing the incidence of pancreatic metastasis among 4955 adult autoptic specimens with 973 surgical specimens ,\nthe incidence of pancreatic metastasis in the autoptic specimens was 3.83% ( 190 cases ) among which metastasis from rcc was 0.08% ( 4 cases ) .\nin contrast , even though the incidence of pancreatic metastasis in 973 resected specimens was similar ( 3.93% ; 38 cases ) , the incidence of metastasis from rcc was 0.61%.4 however , rcc was the most common primary tumor leading to solitary pancreatic metastasis among the resected specimens.37 metastases may present many years after a nephrectomy.1011 the mode of spread form the rcc to the pancreas may be through lymphatics or by hematogenous spread . abdominal ultrasonography and ct scan are reliable although the generally hypervascular image seen in ct could resemble that of an endocrine pancreatic tumor as primary pancreatic tumors tend to be hypovascular.1213 where available , eus is now widely accepted as the test of choice for both imaging and sampling of pancreatic masses .\nit is particularly useful for evaluation of small masses , equivocal cross - sectional imaging or for sampling of pancreatic masses , or after previously non - diagnostic biopsies.14 eus also permits assessment of vascular invasion and lymph node invasion , which may aid in patient management and limit potential surgical morbidity and mortality .\nlesions are typically rounded well - delineated masses , which are hypoechoic in comparison to adjacent pancreatic tissue.131415 resection of a pancreatic metastasis may involve a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy or a distal pancreatectomy depending on the location of the secondary deposit .\natypical resection of pancreatic metastasis from rcc , such as duodenum - preserving pancreatic head resection , middle pancreatectomy and enucleation of the tumor , has been adopted by some authors.911 the choice of a standard or an atypical surgical procedure is probably less important than a careful search for multiple metastases.9 surgical treatment of isolated pancreatic metastasis from neoplasms other than rcc carries a poor prognosis as they signal the onset of disseminated metastatic disease.37 by contrast , the outcome of surgery for isolated pancreatic metastasis from rcc is clearly superior with a mean survival of 4 years and an actuarial 5 years survival ranging from 43% to 88% , which is even better than that of primary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.39 factors associated with a favorable prognosis include a long disease - free interval after resection of the primary tumor , a single metastatic deposit with central necrosis and complete excision of the secondary deposit with histologically negative margins.16 others have reported that the tumor grade of the pancreatic metastasis correlated with the grade of the primary renal cell cancer and that tumor grade was a predictor of survival with a median survival of 41 months for grade 2 cancer and 10 months for grade 3 cancer.17 in summary , pancreatic metastases from rcc , although rare , are well - documented and may be the only site of metastasis .\nthey may present many years after resection of the primary rcc and thus , should be looked for during the follow - up or in patients with upper abdominal symptoms .\nwhen possible , complete surgical resection offers the best chance of cure . local recurrence or a new site of tumor development in the pancreas\npreviously resected rcc metastasis at other sites should not discourage aggressive treatment of an isolated pancreatic secondary tumor ."}

monitoring with a glucometer , of which only one person tested daily .\na fifth of the patients ( 19% ) reported that their daily routine has changed because of the hypoglycemic symptoms .\nfew patients , ( 5% ) have even changed doctors due to hypoglycemic episodes . from table 2 , it is seen that patients who are on insulin along with oral hypoglycemic agent ( ohas ) are at a higher risk for hypoglycemia compared to patients taking only ohas ( p < 0.01 ) . however , in this study association between duration of diabetes and occurrence of hypoglycemia was not statistically significant .\nthis was a cross - sectional study done with the objective of finding the proportion of type 2 diabetic patients who report one or other symptom of hypoglycemia in the past 1 year and their practices with respect to hypoglycemia conducted in the diabetes op of a medical college hospital .\nweakness and dizziness were the most common symptoms , and dizziness , shaking , and excessive hunger were commonly the first symptom of presentation .\nfor most of the patients ( 87% ) , the precipitating factor was missing meals followed by exertion ( 33% ) and almost all were relieved after eating or drinking something .\nthe diabetics adopted different preventive measures , but only 1.4% did self - monitoring with a glucometer .\nthose taking insulin were at a higher risk for hypoglycemia compared to those taking only ohas ( p < 0.01 ) .\nthe ada stresses that individuals at risk for hypoglycemia should be asked about symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycemia at each encounter .\nglucose ( 1520 g ) is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with hypoglycemia , although any form of carbohydrate that contains glucose may be used .\nthe individual should consume a meal or snack to prevent recurrence of hypoglycemia . in this study ,\nsimilar results have been shown in the survey done in america where 20% of them required assistance from another party and 6% visited emergency departments for their hypoglycemia . in a german study to assess the incidence and predictors of hypoglycemia during intensification of treatment regime for type 2 diabetes patients on one or more ohas , the documented rate of hypoglycemia was 11% in the last 12 months which increased to 14% incidence in the year of follow - up due to intensification . in another retrospective , a interview - based study by miller et al . in 2001 among 1055 type 2 diabetics , the prevalence of all hypoglycemia was 16% among those taking ohas and 30% among those taking insulin . in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial in 1998 in the uk among type 2 diabetics on ohas and/or insulin , the incidence of any severity hypoglycemia was 17% among those on glyburide , 11% among those on chlorpropamide , and 36.5% among those taking insulin . that of severe hypoglycemia requiring third party assistance was 0.6% , 0.4% , and 2.3% , respectively .\ntherefore , it is impossible to estimate the prevalence of hypoglycemia based on plasma glucose concentration in most clinical settings in india .\nmost of the symptoms of hypoglycemia are not specific and can occur in normal individuals also .\nworkgroup of the ada and the endocrine society has concurred that a single threshold value for plasma glucose concentration can not be assigned to define hypoglycemia in diabetes as the glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower and higher plasma glucose concentrations among those with recent antecedent hypoglycemia and in patients with poorly controlled diabetes , respectively .\nthe cutoff value is given just to draw the attention of the patients , and caregivers to the potential harm associated with hypoglycemia .\nit is , therefore , possible that many of the patients may experience the symptoms at a higher blood glucose levels causing distress that affects the daily routine of life .\nthis is one of the first studies done with the objective of finding the reported prevalence of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients .\nit highlights the first symptoms , frequency of severe episodes , and the practices and preventive measures adopted by patients in handling hypoglycemia .\ntherefore , it is impossible to estimate the prevalence of hypoglycemia based on plasma glucose concentration in most clinical settings in india .\nmost of the symptoms of hypoglycemia are not specific and can occur in normal individuals also .\nworkgroup of the ada and the endocrine society has concurred that a single threshold value for plasma glucose concentration can not be assigned to define hypoglycemia in diabetes as the glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower and higher plasma glucose concentrations among those with recent antecedent hypoglycemia and in patients with poorly controlled diabetes , respectively .\nthe cutoff value is given just to draw the attention of the patients , and caregivers to the potential harm associated with hypoglycemia .\nit is , therefore , possible that many of the patients may experience the symptoms at a higher blood glucose levels causing distress that affects the daily routine of life .\nthis is one of the first studies done with the objective of finding the reported prevalence of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients .\nit highlights the first symptoms , frequency of severe episodes , and the practices and preventive measures adopted by patients in handling hypoglycemia .\nit is seen from the study that the reported prevalence of hypoglycemia is very high among type 2 diabetic patients and even severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance is reported in a fifth of them , but self -

{"id": 60, "text": "the use of visible light to examine intraocular processes can be considered the traditional form of imaging in ophthalmology .\nmolecular imaging permits noninvasive visualization and measurement of molecular and cell biology in living subjects , thereby complementing conventional anatomical imaging .\nmolecular imaging is defined as the ability to visualize and quantitatively measure the function of biological and cellular processes in vivo [ 1 , 2 ] , while anatomical imaging plays a major role in medical imaging for diagnosis , surgical guidance , and treatment monitoring , focused and personalized therapy , and earlier treatment followup .\nthe main advantage of in vivo molecular imaging is its ability to characterize pathologies of diseased tissues without invasive biopsies or surgical procedures , and with this information in hand , a more personalized treatment - planning regimen can be applied . \n in vivo visualization techniques of the retinal microcirculation , including conventional fundus fluorescein angiography ( ffa ) and indocyanine green angiography ( icga ) or the experimental laser - targeted angiography [ 3 , 4 ] , are used to investigate the retinal vascular network and hemodynamic conditions .\nhowever , these methods do not allow evaluation of leukocyte endothelial interaction in the retinal flow or identification of specific molecular changes during disease . recently\n, we introduced a novel technique for detection of endothelial surface molecules in ocular inflammation . using adhesive molecule - conjugated fluorescent microspheres ( mss )   in live animals\n, we showed early endothelial changes in ocular microvessels at an early stage , which were previously detectable only by the most sensitive in vitro techniques , such as immunohistochemistry or pcr . in fluorescence imaging ,\nlight of the excitation wavelengths must penetrate tissues to reach a targeted reporter molecule carrying a fluorochrome , resulting in the emission of light of usually lower wavelength that can be registered by a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera .\nfluorescent proteins , such as cyan , green , or yellow fluorescent protein , can be introduced into cells of choice by transgenic technology . for accurate in vivo detection and measurement ,\nthis paper briefly describes different molecular imaging techniques and devices used in retinal imaging , as well as potential imaging tools and targets that may be translated into clinical applications in the near future .\nthe development of molecular imaging is rooted in radiology and nuclear medicine as well as in molecular biology . since the 1950s\n, nuclear imaging of radioactive isotope - labeled biomacromolecule has been an integral part of drug development and diagnostic imaging .\nthe broad clinical significance of such approaches remained restricted until positron emission tomography was introduced in 1979 and became an important tool for the detection of metabolic activities in tissues such as the brain and heart , as well as in cancer .\nit facilitated a biological imaging readout , albeit with limited specificity . around the same time ,\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy promoted the evolution of molecular imaging . the ability to collect information about specific endogenous molecules by taking advantage of\nthese advances paved the way for pioneering molecular imaging studies by demonstrating in vivo imaging of reporter gene expression .\nconcurrently , optical bioluminescence imaging for in vivo detection of the fluc reporter gene was demonstrated .\nthe introduction of imaging instrumentation dedicated to small animals   and the description of enzyme - activated small - molecule probes for optical fluorescence imaging further fueled scientific interest .\nrecent work has focused on the extension and refinement of molecular imaging technology and its application to the diagnosis of cancer   and cardiovascular disease .\nthe use of visible light to examine intraocular processes can be considered the oldest form of imaging in ophthalmology .\noptical molecular imaging technologies use light emitted through fluorescence or bioluminescence . in fluorescence imaging , light of the excitation wavelengths must penetrate tissues to reach a targeted reporter molecule carrying a fluorochrome , resulting in the emission of light of usually lower wavelength that can be registered by a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera .\nfluorescent proteins , such as cyan , green , or yellow fluorescent protein can be introduced into cells of choice by transgenic technology .\nthese animals render all cells expressing the fractalkine receptor , such as microglia cells , dendritic cells , and macrophages , intrinsically fluorescent .\ncertain filters , such as those used by fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography , allow the detection of specifically fluorescent structures . as in fluorescence imaging , numerous transgenic animals\nhave been generated that express various types of luciferase under different promoters whose expression in disease models can be measured after florescence injection .\nimaging stations have been developed that allow detection of even faint light emission from within the body of experimental animals .\nthis method is particularly helpful when long emission wavelengths are employed , because these penetrate living tissues much better .\nnoninvasive time - course analyses have therefore become possible and could theoretically be of great use in ophthalmology as well as in other fields . inflammation and tracing of inflammatory cells has been a key topic in molecular imaging in recent years .\nusing an established model of ocular inflammation , endotoxin - induced uveitis , sun and colleagues visualized the rolling and adhesive interaction of fluorescent microspheres conjugated to recombinant p - selectin glycoprotein ligand - ig ( rpsgl - ig ) in the choriocapillaris by means of slo . in our recent work ,\nwe further introduce novel molecular imaging agents that target two distinct types of endothelial surface molecules , a mediator of rolling and one that mediates firm adhesion , and evaluate the success of anti - inflammatory treatment in vivo .\nour imaging approach is founded on certain aspects of leukocyte - endothelial interaction , a common component in the pathogenesis of various ocular diseases .\nleukocytes normally do not interact with the endothelium of blood vessels , save for occasional tethering .\nhowever , at sites of inflammation , endothelial cells express adhesion molecules , such as p - selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( icam-1 ) which facilitate the multistep leukocyte recruitment cascade .\nthe steps of the recruitment process include tethering , rolling , firm adhesion , and transmigration into the extravascular space [ 7 , 19 ] .\nour results show the superior sensitivity of double - conjugated mss for detection of endothelial injury , compared to mss that only target one type of endothelial markers .\nour previous work showed accumulation of rpsgl-1-conjugated mss in choroidal microvessels . here , we also quantitatively compare the rolling of various mss in retinal and choroidal vessels .\nthe rolling flux of rpsgl-1-conjugated mss is significantly higher in eiu animals than in controls .\nin contrast , the rolling flux of anti - icam-1-conjugated mss is not significantly different between eiu and control animals .\nthis finding is in line with the fact that cd18/icam-1 is not primarily a rolling ligand pair in vivo .\nthe significantly higher rolling interaction of the double - conjugated mss compared to the rpsgl-1-conjugated mss indicates that icam-1 may contribute to the rolling of the mss , once the interaction with the endothelium is initiated .\nsurprisingly , the rolling velocity of the double - conjugated mss is significantly higher in the choroidal vessels than in the retina . the absolute number of ms interactions in the choriocapillaris is higher than in the retina .\nthis difference might be explained by the higher vascular density in the choriocapillaris compared to the retina . also , the inflammatory response in the choroid may differ from retina .\nanother striking qualitative difference between the two vascular beds is that , in the retina , most rolling initiates from the periphery and continues toward the optic nerve head , suggesting that the rolling interaction mainly occurs in the retinal veins .\nacridine orange digital fluorography revealed leucocyte rolling in the retina of animals with experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis .\nretinal images were generated by an slo connected to a computer - assisted image analysis system .\nacridine orange binds to dna and rna , and the spectral properties of acridine orange dna complexes are very similar to those of sodium fluorescein , with a 502  nm excitation maximum and an emission maximum of 522  nm .\nresults reveal that leukocyte endothelium interaction and extravascular infiltration in the retinal venous vasculature may play significant roles in the early stages of posterior segment inflammation .\nxu and colleagues reported another method of investigating leucocytes in the retinal vasculature by slo .\nthey tried to inject calcein - acetoxymethyl ester- ( am- ) labeled t cells into the tail vein of rodents .\nleucocyte dynamics can also be monitored in the iris stroma , limbus , and choroid using intravital microscopy with an epifluorescent illumination microscope equipped with a black - and - white camera connected to a video capture card .\nleucocytes were stained either with rhodamine g66 or carboxy fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ( cfse ) to monitor the iris and limbus to visualise leucocytes in the choroid .\ninterleukin- ( il- ) 2 , which is expressed upon stimulation of t cells , commonly serves as t - cell activation marker .\nthey showed by intravital microscopy that transgenic mice expressing gfp under the control of il-2 regulatory elements can be used for in vivo expression assays that allow detection of activated t cells in the iris at multiple time points within the same animal with experimental uveitis .\nintravital microscopy has also been used for imaging dendritic cells in the cornea using transgenic mice that express yfp under control of the cd11c promoter ( cd11c - yfp ) .\ncslo has also been used to visualise apoptosis of single nerve cells in the retina in vivo , in order to perform longitudinal studies of disease processes such as glaucoma .\nthis technique enables direct observation of single nerve cell apoptosis by using alexa fluor 488-labelled annexin v and a prototype zeiss .\nadaptive optics slo was used to image the retinal pigment epithelial ( rpe ) cells in patients with rod - cone dystrophy and bilateral progressive maculopathy .\n adaptive optics  denotes a set of methods for measuring and compensating for the aberration of individual eyes , consisting of trial lenses to correct sphere and cylinder , a shack - hartmann - based wave front sensor to detect residual aberration , and a deformable mirror to correct this residual aberration .\nintegrated into an slo , lateral resolution of 2  mm could be achieved , which enables imaging of rpe cells , cone photoreceptors , and the flow of single leucocytes and the lamina cribrosa .\nchoi and coworkers have integrated adaptive optics into a fundus camera for imaging cone photoreceptors in patients with retinal dystrophies and optic neuropathy .\npreclinical molecular imaging in small animals is an invaluable part of new molecular targets and contrast agents , as well as developing drugs prior to clinical translation .\nresearch shows that the time intensive and expensive preclinical steps involved in molecular target identification , validation , chemical synthesis , and characterization for new molecular imaging agents . in fact , the majority of current molecular imaging agents used in the clinic were discovered through these exhaustive preclinical experiments at academic institutions .\nit is estimated that a molecular imaging agent costs about $ 150 million over 10 years to transfer to the clinic , ending with average double cost per year revenue for successful contrast agents .\nto identify a molecular target beginning with understanding and characterizing the biology , the first step is to find the differences between a healthy and diseased state .\nfor instance , since there is an intricate relationship between cancer and inflammation ( chronic inflammation maybe promote , cancer , and cancer onset could promote an inflammatory response ) , the differences between inflammation and cancer states must be characterized .\nin general , much focus is directed to cancer imaging including retinal and choroidal tumor , and several preclinical studies have identified new molecular targets for imaging cancer .\nin addition to imaging the cancer phenotype such as increases in metabolism , angiogenesis , proliferation , hypoxia , and apoptosis , agents have been developed to target specific protein markers expressed on cancer cells .\nmany chemotherapeutic drugs also target these markers ; they have been radiolabelled for assessment of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics using noninvasive molecular imaging .\ncontinuing preclinical research has exploded not only in molecular target discovery and imaging probe developments but also in new strategies for imaging methodologies , especially in the areas of optical imaging . with the advent of new ,\nsmaller instruments / devices for insertion into the body , molecular imaging strategies with optical devices and specific molecular - targeted contrast agents have great potential for translation into the clinic , which is reviewed in the promising sections .\nmolecular imaging can be applied to all parts of medical imaging : early detection , screening , diagnosis , therapy delivery , monitoring , and treatment followup .\nthe current status of clinical molecular imaging is limited , with most current applications using visual able imaging and a small number of highly specific applications for mri and ultrasound .\ncurrent demands and trends are calling for new strategies to focus on early disease detection through improved imaging and screening protocols in retina , as well as patient - specific treatment selection delivery and therapy - specific monitoring .\nit is hoped that these new strategies of early diagnosis and immediate treatment monitoring will improve success rates for curing diseases with high mortality rates such as retinal disease and some types of cancer , as well as providing more specific treatment for other diseases .\npreclinical research has resulted in the identification of a large number of molecular targets and the development of novel molecular imaging contrast agents as well as device , hardware , and software technologies .\nit is expected that molecular imaging in retina with imaging modalities other than our developed mss , pet , mri , molecular ultrasound , and photoacoustic tomography will be integrated into more frequent clinical application in the near future ."}

test was used to compare the performance variance of subjects from both control and experimental groups , in both evaluations ( pre- and post - training ) , considering behavioral auditory processing tests , the electrophysiological test and the aphab .\nthe significance level was set at 5% ( p = 0.05 ) , and confidence intervals were established at 95% .\nsignificant values are highlighted by the symbol ( * ) , and tendency toward statistical significance values are highlighted by the symbol ( # ) .\ntable 2 shows the amount of improvement in behavioral auditory processing tests of the control group comparing pre- and post - training evaluations .\nno significant differences in performance were observed for the majority of behavioral tests , expect for ssi - icm snrs -10 and -15 , which revealed better results post - training .\ntable 3 shows the amount of improvement in behavioral auditory processing tests of the experimental group by comparing pre- and post - training evaluations .\nsignificant differences in performance of the experimental group were observed when comparing the tests results pre- and post - training , demonstrating improved performance following training .\ntable 4 ( variation in latency and amplitude values of llaep for the control group when pre- and post - training evaluations were compared ) shows that significant differences were observed for the latencies of p2 and n2 llaep components . for p2 an increase in latency\nwas observed , while for n2 a decrease in latency was verified when comparing pre- and post - training evaluations .\nvariation in latency and amplitude values of llaep of the experimental group when comparing pre- and post - training evaluations ) it is easily seen that for the experimental group , a significantly lower latency was observed for the p3 component of llaep when comparing pre- and post - training evaluations . as with the control group ,\nno significant differences were seen concerning latency . finally , in table 6 ( benefit observed in aphab of control and experimental groups when comparing pre- and post - training administration ) , we present the comparison of benefit observed through the administration of the aphab to the control and experimental groups .\nno differences were noted for the control group , while there was a trend toward statistical significance for the experimental group in the reverberation and background noise sub - scales .\nall patients exhibited abnormal results on at least one of the tests during the pre - training evaluation .\nthus , everyone demonstrated auditory difficulties with degraded stimuli , as previously reported in different studies.1,13,14 auditory difficulty could not be predicted by either functional gain or word recognition scores in quiet , as results were within normal limits under such conditions .\nprior to the auditory training program , performance in the control group was generally poorer than in the experimental group the limited amount of improvement in behavioral tests by the control group ( table 2 ) suggest that all behavioral tests used , except ssi - icm ( -10 and -15 ) , were of minimal value .\ninterestingly poorer results were seen during the post - training evaluation after some tests , including word recognition scores and the speech in noise test . when considering ssi - icm ( -10 and -15 ) , significant differences were observed between pre- and post - training evaluations .\nthis improvement , although insufficient to explain the results completely , could be attributed to patients familiarity with the procedure leading them to ignore the competitive message while focusing on the target sentence .\nthis has occurred in one previous study , where the control groups , without training , showed some improvements during the re - evaluations.15 however , these improvements were not of the same magnitude as those observed in the groups which underwent auditory training .\nthe performance of the experimental group during the post - training evaluation was better than the first evaluation ( table 3 ) , since the comparison between post- and pre - training performance resulted in positive values for all tests .\nstatistically significant differences were observed in sound localization , memory for nonverbal sounds in sequence , the speech in noise test , dichotic digits and ssi - icm ( 0 , -10 , -15 ) , with ssi - icm ( -15 ) demonstrating an improvement of almost 70% .\nthis is interpreted to mean that formal auditory training was effective in improving central auditory skills.1618 the post - training evaluation of the experimental group was within established limits for adults with normal hearing . when sound is introduced into an impaired auditory system , spectral and temporal cues in the central auditory nervous system are altered . as a result , patients are forced to combine different spectral and temporal codes as they remember speech sounds . failure to do so culminates in difficulties in understanding , especially in situations with ambient noise .\nthis was confirmed by the results of the present study during the speech in noise test , in which the subjects performance was negatively influenced by the introduction of noise .\nthe stimuli were the same in both quiet and noise ; only the order of presentation was changed .\nthe results indicate that amplification provided by the hearing aids was insufficient to maintain the same quality in both quiet and noisy environments ( table 2 ) .\nhowever , this auditory skill may be improved with auditory training ( table 3 ) . finally , it is possible that hearing aid fitting alone fails to produce the ideal environment for the auditory system and its skills.2,6,19,20 when a central auditory processing disorder co - exists with peripheral hearing loss , compensation obtained from hearing aids is at times insufficient to compensate for the auditory processing disorder ( apd ) , and the patient may become dissatisfied and frustrated with the performance of the hearing aids.2,19 based on our results , auditory processing evaluations\nalthough there were no significant differences between right and left ears for either group on any of the experimental measures , individual results for some patients in both the control and experimental groups demonstrated asymmetrical results in central auditory processing tests , such as dichotic digits , speech in noise and ssi - icm .\nsuch differences were minimized for subjects in the experimental group after the completion of training .\nthe phenomenon of binaural interference is suspected when performance in speech tests with binaural amplification is worse than with monaural or without hearing aids.4,6,2123 in cases of binaural interference , a unilateral hearing aid fitting is advisable .\nit is important to consider that in the case of a monaural fitting , the unaided ear may suffer the deleterious effects of sensory deprivation , affecting neural plasticity and leading to a progressive degradation of word recognition on the non - aided side .\nthis can occur even when auditory thresholds are stable.14,24 as discussed above , one could question whether it would be more reasonable to document asymmetry in a patient with a central auditory processing disorder and then fit both ears to maximize the advantages of binaural hearing . after waiting a reasonable acclimatization period ,\nthe patient would be enrolled in a formal auditory training program , at the end of which the decision would be made as to whether a binaural or a monaural hearing aid fitting is more suitable .\none of the most controversial aspects of formal auditory training is the use of the same test for training and evaluation .\ntraining for the test  , thereby resulting in a positive bias during re - evaluation .\nnonetheless , our results suggest that generalization in non - trained contexts is possible since , in the tests used only for evaluation , including sound localization , memory for verbal and nonverbal sounds and the speech in noise tests , objective and subjective measures showed improved results for the experimental group after training .\nsuch results can be attributed to the auditory training with a considerable degree of confidence .\ngeneralization for non - trained situations has been mentioned in several previous studies.16 , 2528 the maintenance of any learned pattern depends on its use.27,29 therefore , it seems reasonable to conclude that benefits accrued from the auditory training program will be maintained if the patient continues to use what he or she has learned .\nhowever , future studies are needed to determined if this is the case . concerning llaep ,\nthe n1-p2-n2 and p3 complexes were identified in all patients from both the control and experimental groups , and all subjects exhibited latency values within normal limits .\nthese results concur with those of previous authors , who have noted that the presence of peripheral hearing loss , especially to mild and moderate degrees ( which is the case in this study ) , does not prevent the registration of late potentials , since the patient is able to perceive both rare and frequent stimuli.3032 however , also mentioned in other studies is considerable inter - subject variability for both latency and amplitude values.15,27,37 statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between right and left ears .\nsince both ears were considered in the study , statistical analysis was made more reliable , as the sample size was doubled .\nthe control and experimental groups did not differ with regard to llaep components in latency or amplitude in the first evaluation .\nhowever , when comparing the variation in latencies values between pre and post training evaluations of the control group ( table 4 ) , significant changes were observed for p2 and n2 latencies . the p2 component showed an increase in latency of 12.86 ms , while a decrease of 5.60 ms was observed for the n2 component .\nthe n1-p2-n2 complex of llaep is influenced by attention.9 if the target stimulus is ignored , waveforms may be attenuated , and possible delays in latency may be observed .\nfor the experimental group , a statistically significant reduction in p3 latency ( 27 ms ) was observed when comparing latency between the pre- and post - training electrophysiological evaluation ( table 5 ) . although no statistical differences were demonstrated in p3 latency for the control group , a slight increase in latency of 6.43 ms was noted ( table 4 )\n. latency reduction of evoked potentials after auditory training has been described as a neurophysiologic correlate of neural plasticity . in many cases ,\nthis change may precede a behavioral change , which could take longer since it requires the integration of neural modifications and conscious perception and also involves higher cognitive processes.15,33,34 furthermore , latency reduction may be understood as an improvement in electrophysiological function .\nthis improvement may be attributed to the auditory training , as the training was carried out after the acclimatization period.11,14,35,36 finally , as an objective measure of neural change , the improvement appears to influence neural plasticity in adults , as mentioned in a number of other studies.6,28,29,34,3739 since the importance of temporal aspects in maximizing auditory skills is well recognized , the latency reduction observed in the experimental group may be of critical importance for improving communication for hearing aid users , especially in adverse environments .\nthis improvement , along with advanced hearing aid technology , may help patients in daily situations , leading to improved use of hearing aids and better social integration .\nno statistically significant differences were observed in the variation of amplitude between the pre- and post - training evaluations for both groups ( tables 4 and 5 ) .\nthe increase in amplitude , especially of p3 after auditory training , suggests better synchrony in neural firing and attention improvement and has also been shown to be related to neural plasticity.15,27,28,34,38,40 there is still controversy regarding which parameter , latency or amplitude , is the better indicator of neurophysiologic improvement when determining the efficacy of a specific therapeutic approach.33 we conclude that amplitude , as measured in the present study , does not allow for inferences about the efficiency of the auditory training program described here .\nour results were the same as those previously noted in different studies in the literature.27,28,31,38 the results from this portion of the study suggest that the behavioral and electrophysiological improvements observed in the experimental group after training support central changes and improved functioning and highlight the importance of establishing the interaction between the central auditory nervous system and amplified sound , as previously recommended.36,39 the aphab self - assessment questionnaire was selected to help determine whether the expected / observed changes in electrophysiological and behavioral evaluations would interfere with the patient s subjective evaluation .\nthere does not appear to be a specific self - assessment questionnaire designed to quantify changes observed in adult hearing aid users following a specific auditory training program .\nhowever , aphab has been shown to be a powerful instrument for recording the benefit of a specific therapeutic approach.41 thus , we felt it the most appropriate self - assessment questionnaire for our study .\nself - assessment questionnaires have played a very important role in the validation stage of hearing aid fitting , as they reveal the benefits perceived in daily situations with amplification.35 the similarity of responses for both groups regarding the ease of communication sub - scale ( ec ) indicates that the patients were well - adapted to their hearing aids , mainly in silent environments and/or in conversations involving small groups in relatively quiet places .\nhowever , the vast majority complained of difficulties hearing in noisy environments ( table 6 ) . some admitted they removed their hearing aids in such environments .\nthis strategy frequently put them in embarrassing situations , leaving them feeling uncomfortable with their hearing aids in and missing important parts of conversations , dialogues and lectures without them .\nas the subjects in our study wore hearing aids in both situations when answering the aphab , the magnitude of benefit should not be the same as was seen during the original application of this instrument .\nno significant differences were observed in the control group at all sub - scales , when comparing the first and second applications .\nthis suggests that reported difficulties remained stable , as previously reported.42 however for the experimental group , communicating in noisy and reverberant environments was easier than before the training .\ntable 6 shows the comparison of percentage of difficulties experienced by the participants in the sub - scales of aphab for both applications of the questionnaires , pre- and post - training .\nalthough the differences observed in the experimental group in reverberation and background noise sub - scales only trended toward statistical significance , all sub - scales revealed negative values , indicating that after auditory training participants in the experimental group reported fewer difficulties in daily situations .\nthis means that communication in adverse environments became easier for the experimental group following auditory training . in another study ,\n90% of adult hearing aid users felt more capable and more confident in challenging auditory situations after auditory training with a commercial available cd - rom.2 the opposite occurred in the control group , where positive values were seen in the ease of communication , background noise and averseness to loud sound sub - scales ( table 6 ) .\nimprovements for the experimental group were previously noticed in electrophysiological and behavioral evaluations ( tables 2 to 5 ) .\nalthough subjects in both groups were similar in peripheral hearing status and hearing aid technology , environmental differences are expected and may account for differences in subjective measures such as self - assessment questionnaires .\ncommunication improvement in noisy environments should be the primary goal of any auditory training program , especially since such environments are common in everyday life .\nhowever , there is still the chance of having a subject whose hearing thresholds have been made normal but who has an auditory processing disorder .\nsuch a patient would not complain of difficulties in receiving sounds but rather in interpreting them , especially in the presence of increasing noise .\nit is suggested that administering an auditory training program , as described in the present study , and a self - assessment questionnaire , such as the aphab , could make the assessment and identification of hearing - impaired patients with an additional auditory processing disorder easier .\nthe results of the present study suggest that formal auditory training was able to improve the central auditory skills of hearing aid users .\nimprovement was noted in an objective neurophysiologic correlate and perceived by patients , as revealed in a self - assessment questionnaire .\ntherefore , we strongly advocate investing time searching for the presence of a central auditory processing disorder during the course of all hearing aid fittings .\nfurthermore , programs for rehabilitation of these skills are essential for all patients identified , regardless of age . in many cases , the high cost of hearing aids prevents patients from acquiring them , particularly if the patient feels that the benefit will not outweigh the high cost of the investment . including an initial auditory processing evaluation and formal auditory training should provide a basis for such patients to feel more confident about purchasing a sophisticated and expensive hearing aid .\naudiologists play an important role in this situation by helping patients realize the importance of auditory training and introducing it as a part of the hearing aid fitting process . after a critical analysis of the results\n, we can conclude that formal auditory training in adult hearing aid users promotes : latency reduction of the p3 component of llaep .\nimprovement in auditory skills for sound localization , memory for nonverbal sounds in sequence , auditory closure and figure - to - ground for verbal sounds ."}

control study reported a higher or for the risk of hospitalization for a diagnosis of pancreatitis in patients taking  incretin - based medications ,  since a separate analysis for the use of exenatide ( glp-1 receptor agonist ) or sitagliptin ( dpp-4 inhibitor ) did not yield significant findings ( fig .\nit can not be excluded at present that a potential combination of stomach cramps , representing gastrointestinal adverse events of glp-1 receptor agonists , and spontaneously elevated serum lipase activities were responsible for the hospitalizations and do not represent true pancreatitis episodes .\nnevertheless , this small study analyzing only a few patients with pancreatitis is only the second study describing an elevated risk ( 24 ) , however , only by combining exenatide and sitagliptin treatments as  incretin - based medications  and after adjusting for potential confounders .\nfigure 1b and d presents ors and p values ( all nonsignificant ) calculated without adjustment for potential risk - modifying factors .\nfurthermore , treatment with the glp-1 receptor agonist liraglutide can lead to elevations in lipase without associated symptoms of pancreatitis ( 25 ) . using such enzyme measurements to  screen  for pancreatitis may have resulted in false diagnoses of pancreatitis because elevations in pancreatic enzymes do not have the degree of specificity that would be necessary to make it a helpful screening instrument .\nindeed , elevated lipase and amylase activity is found quite frequently in patients with type 2 diabetes with an absence of abdominal pain ( 26 ) . under these circumstances , most elevated amylase or lipase levels would be chance findings without any relationship to inflammatory changes within the exocrine pancreas .\nhowever , the nature of the elevation in serum lipase induced by liraglutide treatment needs to be explored so that we can understand its mechanism .\nat least this phenomenon indicates an interaction of glp-1 receptor agonists with the exocrine pancreas , perhaps indicating the presence of glp-1 receptors in this compartment .\neffects of glp-1 receptor stimulation on pancreatic enzyme synthesis , potential leakage into the circulation rather than directional secretion into pancreatic digestive juice , and a potential induction of a chronic inflammatory response need to be studied . to date\n, it certainly can not be taken as a fact that chronic stimulation of the glp-1 receptor ( as occurs during the treatment with incretin mimetics and dpp-4 inhibitors ) induces acute or chronic inflammatory responses in the pancreas , nor that , based on a well - delineated mechanism and supported by convincing epidemiological data , the clinical use of incretin - based glucose - lowering medications would cause pancreatitis .\nclinically , the development of typical chronic pancreatitis diagnosed because of typical morphological findings and exocrine insufficiency leading to maldigestion , nutritional deficiencies , and weight loss over and above what is expected from continued stimulation of brain glp-1 receptors ( 1,27 ) in patients treated with glp-1based medications has never been described . regarding the related question of chronic changes in the exocrine pancreas leading to pancreatic duct proliferation and the formation of preneoplastic lesions ( like pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms or pancreatic duct glands ) , data from animal studies are similarly controversial with studies showing alterations of the exocrine pancreatic histology indicative of chronic pancreatitis with exenatide treatment ( 57 ) , while another recent study using liraglutide did describe occasional pancreatitis as a rare finding  but not at all related to the dose of liraglutide  with similar numbers in placebo - treated rats , mice , and monkeys ( 13 ) .\nit appears highly unlikely that there should be a difference intrinsic to the two glp-1 receptor agonists used ( exenatide vs. liraglutide ) .\na recent finding reported that pancreas specimens from organ donors with type 2 diabetes , who had received treatment with the dpp-4 inhibitor sitagliptin ( n = 7 ) or exenatide ( n = 1 ) , relative to patients with type 2 diabetes treated with other agents , had marked -cell hyperplasia , -cells coexpressing insulin and glucagon , hyperplasia of -cells expressing glucagon , increased expression of proliferation markers , and an increased prevalence of preneoplastic lesions ( 29 ) .\nthis finding needs to be confirmed in a larger , representative sample of pancreas specimens obtained without preceding long - term critical illness , which alone may be responsible for some proliferative responses ( 30 ) . to put the state of this present discussion into perspective\n, it should be made clear that at most early proliferative or preneoplastic changes have been observed , which as such are not proof that eventually the process described will give rise to pancreatic cancer .\nthus we have to discuss a potential risk ( and certainly want to learn more about the long - term consequences of stimulating glp-1 receptors for the exocrine pancreas ) , but not an actual threat to patients treated with incretin - based medications , based on a well - characterized mechanism with a risk clearly elevated based on sound epidemiological analyses .\nit is reassuring that no case of clinically evident chronic pancreatitis has been described after initiating treatment with incretin - based medications .\ncertainly , there is also no case report of pancreatic cancer diagnosed after exposing a patient to glp-1 receptor agonists or dpp-4 inhibitors in a patient in whom there had previously been a morphologically tumor - free pancreas . since pancreatic carcinomas develop slowly (\n31 ) , one would probably not expect to see such a case after at most a few years of treatment , considering the recent introduction of the incretin - based medications , even if there were such a long - term risk .\nglp-1 receptor agonists have the potential to induce proliferative changes in rodent thyroid c cells .\nliraglutide increased the number of cases with c - cell hyperplasia , adenomas , and medullary thyroid carcinomas in mice and rats ( 9 ) . in these species\nsuch abnormalities are also found spontaneously , i.e. , in the absence of glp-1 receptor stimulation , especially in male rats , in which medullary thyroid carcinoma developed in some animals treated with placebo ( 9 ) .\naccordingly , rodent c - cell lines in cell culture responded to glp-1 , exenatide , and liraglutide with acutely producing cyclic amp and secreting calcitonin ( 9 ) .\nsimilar cell lines of human origin do not show such acute responses when glp-1 receptors are stimulated ( 9 ) . whereas rodent c - cell lines are equipped with glp-1 receptors at a high level of expression ,\nalong the same lines , long - term treatment in obese human subjects with high liraglutide doses up to 3-mg per day does not lead to elevations in plasma calcitonin ( 32 ) .\nbased on these results , the ability of glp-1 receptor stimulation to induce proliferative responses in human c cells has been judged as probably absent .\nmedullary thyroid carcinomas are an extremely rare form of thyroid carcinomas in humans ( 33 ) .\nno case report has been published describing a medullary thyroid carcinoma in a patient receiving a treatment with a glp-1 receptor agonist who prior to such treatment had a morphologically normal thyroid gland and low calcitonin concentrations . given the rare incidence of medullary thyroid carcinoma , 1 ) the consequences of a potential elevation in the risk induced by incretin mimetics would still remain small , and 2 ) to prove or exclude such a relationship , efficient surveillance of extremely large numbers of patients would be needed .\nthe elevated risk for thyroid carcinoma in more general terms described in the study exploring the faers database ( 22 ) is difficult to reconcile .\nsimilar reservations apply regarding reporting bias as mentioned for the pancreatitis / pancreatic carcinoma issue raised earlier ( vide supra ) .\ncertainly , this would not be compatible with an explanation through a higher number of medullary carcinomas alone , which would need to increase by more than 30-fold in order to explain such numbers .\nhowever , whether follicular cells express glp-1 receptors ( 9 ) or whether malignant cells from thyroid tumors of different histological varieties ( e.g. , papillary thyroid carcinomas ) express the glp-1 receptors ( 34 ) is controversial and may be related to the specificity of the antibody or the radioligand used for immunohistochemistry ( 35 ) .\nthe fact alone that some papillary thyroid carcinomas may show evidence of glp-1 receptor expression ( 34 ) does not prove that such receptors and their stimulation by drugs may contribute to the genesis or proliferation of such tumors .\nregarding the thyroid issues , certainly more investigations are required , but one hardly can conclude that , based on current knowledge , there is a definitely increased risk for medullary ( or other types of ) thyroid carcinoma with the use of glp-1 receptor agonists .\nnevertheless , patients with an individually elevate genetic risk should not be treated with such agents .\nan elevated risk when using dpp-4 inhibitors does not have to considered at all since no such findings have been reported ( 22 ) . in the absence of large - scale cardiovascular outcome trials , summaries of cardiovascular events reported as adverse events in clinical trials with incretin - based glucose - lowering medications and meta - analyses based thereon ( 36 ) are the best available source of information for an overall judgment at present .\nphase 3 studies have accrued a number of cardiovascular events sufficient for a preliminary judgment based on trends .\nthese trends observed for the incretin mimetics exenatide ( 37 ) and liraglutide ( 38 ) as well the dpp-4 inhibitors sitagliptin ( 39 ) , vildagliptin ( 40 ) , saxagliptin ( 41 ) , linagliptin ( 42 ) , and alogliptin ( 43 ) are surprisingly similar .\n2 , in all these analyses the relative risk for a combined end point composed of acute myocardial infarction , stroke , and cardiovascular death is reduced with any of the glp-1based medications relative to placebo or comparator treatment to a value below 1 ( fig .\nhowever , the 95% cis ranged to above 1.0 with most compounds , indicating that the number of events available for this analysis was too small to allow the definite conclusion of a significant improvement in cardiovascular prognosis with incretin - based glucose - lowering treatment .\nrelative risk for major cardiovascular events reported as adverse events during phase 3 studies with the glp-1 receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide ( upper panel ) and with the dpp-4 inhibitors sitagliptin , vildagliptin , saxagliptin , alogliptin , and linagliptin ( lower panel ) compared with pooled comparators ( placebo or active control medications ) .\ndata have been taken from the references quoted in the figure ( 3743 ) . a potential reduction in cardiovascular event rates with linagliptin treatment\nis further supported by a recent study comparing linagliptin with the sulfonylurea glimepiride ( 44 ) .\nthere is some plausibility based on the influences of glp-1based drugs on cardiovascular risk factors ( 45 ) .\nthey also reduce systolic blood pressure by 25 mmhg , mechanistically explained by improved endothelial function and vasodilation , enhanced natriuresis , and fluid excretion .\nthere is a potential for a reduction in postprandial triglyceride - rich lipoproteins , especially with those agents that have and preserve over time a prominent effect on gastric emptying .\neffects on  nonclassical  cardiovascular risk factors point in the same direction . furthermore , glp-1 receptor stimulation has reduced the extent of myocardial necroses in animal experiments inducing acute myocardial infarction by coronary artery ligation .\nthe results have been surprisingly uniform using different agents ( glp-1 , exenatide , liraglutide , sitagliptin ) in various species ( 45 ) .\nin addition , in animal models of left ventricular failure , glp-1 and incretin mimetics may increase cardiac output by stimulating glucose and oxygen uptake into the myocardium .\nclinical pilot trials support the notion that glp-1 receptor stimulation may be beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome and chronic congestive heart failure ( 45 ) .\ntherefore , one may be optimistic that cardiovascular outcome trials being performed to date , which will report after the year 2015 ( table 2 ) , will at least confirm cardiovascular safety with a potential to substantiate the beneficial effects in this important respect .\ncases of pancreatitis have been observed in animals ( 6,7,13 ) and patients ( 14 ) treated with incretin mimetics and dpp-4 inhibitors ( 5 ) .\nthe questions are whether pancreatitis occurs more often in association with treatment using glp-1based medications , and whether it is causally related to such treatment .\nanimal studies describe histological changes compatible with damage to the exocrine pancreas with exenatide ( 6,7 ) and sitagliptin ( 5 ) .\na similar study examining liraglutide did not confirm such damages induced by an incretin mimetic ( 13 ) .\nother studies find an amelioration of the course of experimentally induced acute pancreatitis in mice with exenatide ( 15 ) or an anti -

based medications  and after adjusting for potential confounders .\nfigure 1b and d presents ors and p values ( all nonsignificant ) calculated without adjustment for potential risk - modifying factors .\nfurthermore , treatment with the glp-1 receptor agonist liraglutide can lead to elevations in lipase without associated symptoms of pancreatitis ( 25 ) . using such enzyme measurements to  screen  for pancreatitis may have resulted in false diagnoses of pancreatitis because elevations in pancreatic enzymes do not have the degree of specificity that would be necessary to make it a helpful screening instrument .\nindeed , elevated lipase and amylase activity is found quite frequently in patients with type 2 diabetes with an absence of abdominal pain ( 26 ) . under these circumstances , most elevated amylase or lipase levels would be chance findings without any relationship to inflammatory changes within the exocrine pancreas .\nhowever , the nature of the elevation in serum lipase induced by liraglutide treatment needs to be explored so that we can understand its mechanism .\nat least this phenomenon indicates an interaction of glp-1 receptor agonists with the exocrine pancreas , perhaps indicating the presence of glp-1 receptors in this compartment .\neffects of glp-1 receptor stimulation on pancreatic enzyme synthesis , potential leakage into the circulation rather than directional secretion into pancreatic digestive juice , and a potential induction of a chronic inflammatory response need to be studied . to date , it certainly can not be taken as a fact that chronic stimulation of the glp-1 receptor ( as occurs during the treatment with incretin mimetics and dpp-4 inhibitors ) induces acute or chronic inflammatory responses in the pancreas , nor that , based on a well - delineated mechanism and supported by convincing epidemiological data , the clinical use of incretin - based glucose - lowering medications would cause pancreatitis . clinically , the development of typical chronic pancreatitis diagnosed because of typical morphological findings and exocrine insufficiency leading to maldigestion , nutritional deficiencies , and weight loss over and above what is expected from continued stimulation of brain glp-1 receptors ( 1,27 ) in patients treated with glp-1based medications has never been described .\nregarding the related question of chronic changes in the exocrine pancreas leading to pancreatic duct proliferation and the formation of preneoplastic lesions ( like pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms or pancreatic duct glands ) , data from animal studies are similarly controversial with studies showing alterations of the exocrine pancreatic histology indicative of chronic pancreatitis with exenatide treatment ( 57 ) , while another recent study using liraglutide did describe occasional pancreatitis as a rare finding  but not at all related to the dose of liraglutide  with similar numbers in placebo - treated rats , mice , and monkeys ( 13 ) .\nit appears highly unlikely that there should be a difference intrinsic to the two glp-1 receptor agonists used ( exenatide vs. liraglutide ) .\na recent finding reported that pancreas specimens from organ donors with type 2 diabetes , who had received treatment with the dpp-4 inhibitor sitagliptin ( n = 7 ) or exenatide ( n = 1 ) , relative to patients with type 2 diabetes treated with other agents , had marked -cell hyperplasia , -cells coexpressing insulin and glucagon , hyperplasia of -cells expressing glucagon , increased expression of proliferation markers , and an increased prevalence of preneoplastic lesions ( 29 ) .\nthis finding needs to be confirmed in a larger , representative sample of pancreas specimens obtained without preceding long - term critical illness , which alone may be responsible for some proliferative responses ( 30 ) . to put the state of this present discussion into perspective\n, it should be made clear that at most early proliferative or preneoplastic changes have been observed , which as such are not proof that eventually the process described will give rise to pancreatic cancer .\nthus we have to discuss a potential risk ( and certainly want to learn more about the long - term consequences of stimulating glp-1 receptors for the exocrine pancreas ) , but not an actual threat to patients treated with incretin - based medications , based on a well - characterized mechanism with a risk clearly elevated based on sound epidemiological analyses .\nit is reassuring that no case of clinically evident chronic pancreatitis has been described after initiating treatment with incretin - based medications .\ncertainly , there is also no case report of pancreatic cancer diagnosed after exposing a patient to glp-1 receptor agonists or dpp-4 inhibitors in a patient in whom there had previously been a morphologically tumor - free pancreas . since pancreatic carcinomas develop slowly ( 31 ) , one would probably not expect to see such a case after at most a few years of treatment , considering the recent introduction of the incretin - based medications , even if there were such a long - term risk .\nglp-1 receptor agonists have the potential to induce proliferative changes in rodent thyroid c cells .\nliraglutide increased the number of cases with c - cell hyperplasia , adenomas , and medullary thyroid carcinomas in mice and rats ( 9 ) . in these species\nsuch abnormalities are also found spontaneously , i.e. , in the absence of glp-1 receptor stimulation , especially in male rats , in which medullary thyroid carcinoma developed in some animals treated with placebo ( 9 ) .\naccordingly , rodent c - cell lines in cell culture responded to glp-1 , exenatide , and liraglutide with acutely producing cyclic amp and secreting calcitonin ( 9 ) .\nsimilar cell lines of human origin do not show such acute responses when glp-1 receptors are stimulated ( 9 ) . whereas rodent c - cell lines are equipped with glp-1 receptors at a high level of expression ,\nalong the same lines , long - term treatment in obese human subjects with high liraglutide doses up to 3-mg per day does not lead to elevations in plasma calcitonin ( 32 ) . based on these results ,\nthe ability of glp-1 receptor stimulation to induce proliferative responses in human c cells has been judged as probably absent .\nmedullary thyroid carcinomas are an extremely rare form of thyroid carcinomas in humans ( 33 ) .\nno case report has been published describing a medullary thyroid carcinoma in a patient receiving a treatment with a glp-1 receptor agonist who prior to such treatment had a morphologically normal thyroid gland and low calcitonin concentrations .\ngiven the rare incidence of medullary thyroid carcinoma , 1 ) the consequences of a potential elevation in the risk induced by incretin mimetics would still remain small , and 2 ) to prove or exclude such a relationship , efficient surveillance of extremely large numbers of patients would be needed .\nthe elevated risk for thyroid carcinoma in more general terms described in the study exploring the faers database ( 22 ) is difficult to reconcile .\nsimilar reservations apply regarding reporting bias as mentioned for the pancreatitis / pancreatic carcinoma issue raised earlier ( vide supra ) .\ncertainly , this would not be compatible with an explanation through a higher number of medullary carcinomas alone , which would need to increase by more than 30-fold in order to explain such numbers .\nhowever , whether follicular cells express glp-1 receptors ( 9 ) or whether malignant cells from thyroid tumors of different histological varieties ( e.g. , papillary thyroid carcinomas ) express the glp-1 receptors ( 34 ) is controversial and may be related to the specificity of the antibody or the radioligand used for immunohistochemistry ( 35 ) .\nthe fact alone that some papillary thyroid carcinomas may show evidence of glp-1 receptor expression ( 34 ) does not prove that such receptors and their stimulation by drugs may contribute to the genesis or proliferation of such tumors .\ncertainly more investigations are required , but one hardly can conclude that , based on current knowledge , there is a definitely increased risk for medullary ( or other types of ) thyroid carcinoma with the use of glp-1 receptor agonists .\nnevertheless , patients with an individually elevate genetic risk should not be treated with such agents .\nan elevated risk when using dpp-4 inhibitors does not have to considered at all since no such findings have been reported ( 22 ) .\nin the absence of large - scale cardiovascular outcome trials , summaries of cardiovascular events reported as adverse events in clinical trials with incretin - based glucose - lowering medications and meta - analyses based thereon ( 36 ) are the best available source of information for an overall judgment at present .\nphase 3 studies have accrued a number of cardiovascular events sufficient for a preliminary judgment based on trends .\nthese trends observed for the incretin mimetics exenatide ( 37 ) and liraglutide ( 38 ) as well the dpp-4 inhibitors sitagliptin ( 39 ) , vildagliptin ( 40 ) , saxagliptin ( 41 ) , linagliptin ( 42 ) , and alogliptin ( 43 ) are surprisingly similar .\n2 , in all these analyses the relative risk for a combined end point composed of acute myocardial infarction , stroke , and cardiovascular death is reduced with any of the glp-1based medications relative to placebo or comparator treatment to a value below 1 ( fig .\n2 ) . however , the 95% cis ranged to above 1.0 with most compounds , indicating that the number of events available for this analysis was too small to allow the definite conclusion of a significant improvement in cardiovascular prognosis with incretin - based glucose - lowering treatment .\nrelative risk for major cardiovascular events reported as adverse events during phase 3 studies with the glp-1 receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide ( upper panel ) and with the dpp-4 inhibitors sitagliptin , vildagliptin , saxagliptin , alogliptin , and linagliptin ( lower panel ) compared with pooled comparators ( placebo or active control medications ) .\na potential reduction in cardiovascular event rates with linagliptin treatment is further supported by a recent study comparing linagliptin with the sulfonylurea glimepiride ( 44 ) .\nthere is some plausibility based on the influences of glp-1based drugs on cardiovascular risk factors ( 45 ) .\nthey also reduce systolic blood pressure by 25 mmhg , mechanistically explained by improved endothelial function and vasodilation , enhanced natriuresis , and fluid excretion .\nthere is a potential for a reduction in postprandial triglyceride - rich lipoproteins , especially with those agents that have and preserve over time a prominent effect on gastric emptying .\neffects on  nonclassical  cardiovascular risk factors point in the same direction . furthermore , glp-1 receptor stimulation has reduced the extent of myocardial necroses in animal experiments inducing acute myocardial infarction by coronary artery ligation .\nthe results have been surprisingly uniform using different agents ( glp-1 , exenatide , liraglutide , sitagliptin ) in various species ( 45 ) .\nin addition , in animal models of left ventricular failure , glp-1 and incretin mimetics may increase cardiac output by stimulating glucose and oxygen uptake into the myocardium .\nclinical pilot trials support the notion that glp-1 receptor stimulation may be beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome and chronic congestive heart failure ( 45 ) .\ntherefore , one may be optimistic that cardiovascular outcome trials being performed to date , which will report after the year 2015 ( table 2 ) , will at least confirm cardiovascular safety with a potential to substantiate the beneficial effects in this important respect .\ntable 1 summarizes the beneficial effects of incretin - based glucose - lowering agents and their advantages over other antidiabetic pharmaceutical agents , but also the open issues discussed earlier in this article in order to define the balance of benefits on the one hand and the risks and harms on the other . regarding the properties of incretin - based medications as antidiabetic drugs , they are effective in lowering glucose and avoid the problems of some other classes of glucose - lowering medications that are related to the induction of hypoglycemia and weight gain .\nsurrogate parameters indicate an improvement in the cardiovascular risk profile , and preliminary analyses of cardiovascular outcomes suggest the potential for benefit in this respect .\ncritical issues exist , but in many respects they are discussed in a controversial manner with only some data in support of an elevated risk ( table 1 ) .\nnausea and vomiting may be intolerable and lead to the discontinuation of treatment with glp-1 receptor agonists . putative interference of dpp-4 inhibitors with immune function does not lead to increased rates of common infections ( 39,46 ) . regarding the issues related to the potential short - term induction of acute and the putative long - term risk for chronic pancreatitis and eventually pancreatic cancer , data at hand today do not convincingly prove such risks .\nthyroid issues related to glp-1 receptors on c cells appear to mainly apply to rodents with a paucity of convincing human data that show a definite risk .\nthe fact that heart rate may increase with glp-1 receptor agonists needs to be understood mechanistically .\npotential explanations could be a reflex compensating for vasodilation ( 47 ) and lower blood pressure ( 10,11,48 ) , a direct effect on the sinus node , or an increased relationship of sympathetic versus parasympathetic autonomous nervous system tone .\nepidemiological findings relating higher heart rates to premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality probably use pulse rate as a surrogate parameter for physical fitness ( 49 ) .\nthere is no reason to assume that incretin - based medications would lead to a reduced cardiorespiratory fitness .\nthus , while the benefits  expected or proven  from using incretin - based medications seem to be substantial and address risks central to patients with type 2 diabetes , the potential harms and risks typically refer to rare events and are discussed in a controversial manner , e.g. , without certainty regarding a potential role of incretin - based medications to cause substantial harm .\nobviously more needs to be learned regarding the open questions , but based on today s available knowledge , incretin - based medications can be considered effective and safe .\nsuch considerations should not currently influence our treatment decisions regarding the potential prescription of glp-1 receptor agonists or dpp-4 inhibitors within a treatment regimen for type 2 diabetes ."}

{"id": 64, "text": "a report , published in september 2009 , from the world health organization ( who)-sponsored study includes tuberculosis ( tb ) and aids with a share of 5.5% each in the list of top 10 causes of death in all 1024 year olds , males and females combined , globally . this has revealed an urgency to act on these issues with all our available resources and an approach to improve upon them .\nstop tb partnership announced the theme for world tuberculosis day 2010 as  on the move against tuberculosis : innovate to accelerate action .\n this calls for ideas and projects to come up with something other than what we have been practicing for long .\nimproving the research in tb has been a neglected area for long , in part due to the complex characteristics of the causal organism mycobacterium tuberculosis , the variable host response to infection , and , perhaps , complacency as this disease was nearly eradicated in high - income settings . with increasing hiv \ntb co - infections , tb has become a high priority for action and research in international health again .\nlooking into this , who and the world bank , with international union against tuberculosis and lung disease ( iuatld ) , centre for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , and other organizations , are reassessing their approaches to the prevention and control of tb .\nof late , agencies such as the foundation for innovative new diagnostics ( find ) , stop tb partnership 's new diagnostics working group ( ndwg ) , global laboratory initiative ( gli , another stop tb partnership working group ) , who , and the special program for research and training in tropical diseases ( tdr ) have shown increased interest toward the development of better diagnostics for tb .\nfunding agencies such as the bill and melinda gates foundation , the global fund to fight aids , tb and malaria ( gfatm ) , and unitaid have emerged as resource providers for work on this disease that was being neglected in terms of sponsorship and interest of the private sector till now . with this , lots of efforts and funds are being brought up for the development of newer diagnostic methods in mycobacteriology .\nthere are multiple hurdles to cross before we reach the ultimate goal of having an efficacious vaccine , easy and affordable diagnosis , and short - term treatment regimens with minimal side effects .\nin the field of tb , problem starts at the very first step , i.e. , diagnosing the case .\nconventional tb diagnosis has been relying on medical history , tuberculin skin test , chest x - rays , and bacteriological examination .\nm. tuberculosis grows slowly , and clinical specimens submitted to the tb microscopy and culture are contaminated to varying degrees by more rapidly growing unwanted normal flora .\n. moreover , the hydrophobic nature of the cell wall due to a high concentration of mycolic acid makes it more difficult to stain mycobaterial cells .\nthe poor sensitivity of conventional smear microscopy has been a major concern . with various samples and sample processing methods ,\nit has been found to be around 3643% sensitive . in general , direct smear reportedly detects afb only at concentrations of around 10,000 bacilli / ml of the specimen .\nconversely , as few as 100 bacilli / ml may be required for a positive culture .\nvarious modifications to the technique and higher level of sophistications have been introduced in this field to get the highest level of sensitivity . with certain variations in the sample processing methods for smear preparation ,\nsamples were subjected to different centrifugation forces and centrifugation times after decontamination and liquefaction and the centrifuged deposits were examined by smear and culture .\nthe sensitivity of detection at an rcf of 4000 g for 15 min was 5000 organisms / ml for a smear .\nvarious workers have demonstrated the improved detection of direct smear - negative cases by universal sample processing ( usp ) smear microscopy .\nthe highest limit of detection in smear microscopy after employing the usp methodology and observing 400500 fields was experimentally found to be 250300 bacilli / ml of the sample . under the best conditions for culture on solid and liquid media with\nusp - treated spiked sputum , the detection limit was found to be 400 cfu / ml after 8 weeks of incubation .\nhence , although it could reduce the bacilli count needed to be detected using smear , it has not helped improving detection by culture .\nhowever , the researchers felt a need for a more sensitive test to detect samples with a low bacterial load .\nsteingart and co - workers did a systematic review to assess the ability of different processing methods to improve the sensitivity of microscopy .\ntheir search suggested that centrifugation with any of several chemical methods ( including bleach ) is more sensitive , that overnight sedimentation preceded by chemical processing is more sensitive , and that the specificity is similar .\nrecently , a pilot study has compared the diagnostic accuracy and incremental yield of two short - duration ( < 1 h ) sputum pretreatment procedures involving pretreatment with bleach and usp centrifugation and concluded that both did not increase yield as compared to direct sputum smears .\npeople tried hard for developing field - based methods to avoid the use of centrifugation during decontamination .\nbut it was found to have a lower sensitivity as compared to the conventional method of centrifuge decontamination .\nfluorescence microscopy is credited with increased sensitivity and lower work effort but has a rider of increased cost and technical complexity .\npai and co - workers have reported an average 10% increment in sensitivity of microscopy using fluorescence microscopy with no difference in specificity .\nlange and mori have given an update on the developments being made in the field of fluorescent microscopy .\nthese include light - emitting diode ( led)-based fluorescent microscopy , mobile phone - based microscopy , and automated detection systems using image processing . with many more other studies ,\nit is very apparent that we are still struggling hard to get a sensitive , easy , cost - effective , and faster method for smear microscopy .\nit seems possible to decrease mortality and morbidity due to tb using smear microscopy diagnosis and dots coverage , as being done in most of the high prevalence countries like india .\nbut as many smear negative cases may remain undiagnosed , cutting transmission of infection does not seem to be an achievable target without having better diagnostic amenities .\njust the presence of acid - fast bacilli ( afb ) on a sputum smear or other specimens does not confirm a diagnosis of tb as all acid - fast - bacilli are not m. tuberculosis .\nalso , bacterial isolation for drug - susceptibility testing and genotyping is required using a solid or liquid medium .\ntherefore , a culture is expected on all initial samples to confirm the diagnosis followed by biochemical tests like catalase test at 68c , nitrate reduction , and niacin accumulation for speciation .\nalthough culture - based diagnosis of tb is recommended in international standards of tuberculosis care , lack of resources and technical expertise poses as a major limitation in most of the high prevalence countries .\ntraditionally , primary isolation and culture of mycobacteria is performed on agar or lowenstein  jensen ( lj ) media .\ndrug susceptibility testing of isolates is done using the same medium following the proportion method .\nthis method compares the mycobacterial growth levels in clinical isolates to be tested with known standard culture in the presence of different concentrations of anti - tb drugs in a proportional way .\nthis method enables a determination of the concentration that inhibits more than 99% of the inoculum and is reported as the minimal inhibitory concentration ( mic ) of the given drug .\nthis is considered as a  gold standard .  but it is cumbersome , technically demanding , lacks reproducibility , and it generally takes at least 21 days for a result after assay set - up .\nliquid culturing with radioisotopic detection or with the incorporation of fluorescent dyes was introduced in the past as a confirmatory method ( bactec 460 , bactec mgit 960 system , mb / bact , and versa trek system ) . however , looking at the sophistication and issues like contamination , the struggle again started to search something better .\nmicroscopic observation drug susceptibility ( mods ) testing developed recently allows both rapid and low - cost tb diagnosis in liquid culture with the simultaneous determination of drug susceptibilities.[1618 ] however , mods requires higher biosafety level facilities , an expert and experienced microbiologist , and the samples are very prone to contaminations .\nthus , it needs addition of various antibiotics in culture media and the samples need to be processed before inoculation involving decontamination and centrifugation steps .\nsome other unconventional methods like thin - layer agar ( tla ) and the direct nitrate reductase assay ( nra ) have attempted to address the problem of multiple point processing and hence the generation of aerosols by incorporating visual inspection of results in the form of typical colony morphology or color change to identify tb growth .\nalthough they have tried to make things simple , they could not avoid the most cumbersome step of specimen processing .\nmicrobiological detection is possible only once the microbial load in the sample reaches a substantial number . some other situations like immune suppression and in the case of children , getting a good quality sample and getting the required microbial load in the samples is tough .\nhence , indirect approaches to trace the causal organism / byproducts or to look into the host response against the infection are also being considered .\nthe pcr - based amplification of various target nucleic acids has been tried extensively that allows rapid and sensitive detection of target dna sequences .\nideally , pcr can detect a single copy of the gene being targeted for amplification but with all the processing to avoid interference , the detection of as few as 410 copies has been made possible by several workers .\nvarious targets have been tried and tested to get better identification or speciation till date .\nalthough the 16s rrna gene is the most commonly used target , other targets have also provided a high - sensitivity and representative species - specific differentiation .\nthe pcr amplification of the entire 16s23s rrna spacer region and use of a secondary technique of randomly amplified polymorphic dna ( rapd ) fingerprinting to differentiate strains belonging to the mycobacterium species has been reported .\nthe amplification of the entire 16s23s intergenic region , and diagnostic tests for bacterial organisms using probes targeted for sequences within the 16s23s intergenic region have also been described .\nother targets include the 16s rrna gene , the 16s23s internal transcribed spacer , the 65-kda heat shock protein , reca , rpob , and gyrb.[232629 ] the 16s rrna gene - based methods are presently widely used for the identification and differentiation of mycobacteria.[3034 ] however , some species can not be differentiated by their 16s sequences because the number of polymorphic sites in the 16s rrna gene in the genus mycobacterium is rather small ( e.g. , mycobacterium kansasii and mycobacterium gastri ) , while others possess a very high degree of sequence similarity ( e.g. , mycobacterium marinum and mycobacterium ulcerans , mycobacterium abscessus , and mycobacterium chelonae ) . the 16s23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer ( its ) region contains both conserved and highly variable signatures and is rather small .\nthe 16s23s rrna gene its - based pcr produces a relatively small pcr product ( 200350 bp ) .\nthis sequence of the 16s23s rrna its can distinguish between m. kansasii and m gastri ; however , it fails to distinguish between m. marinum and m. ulcerans and needs secondary methods like rflp or line blot hybridization to get conclusive results as demonstrated by various workers .\nthe first marketed test was inno - lipa mycobacteria ( innogenetics ) in which the 16s23s intergenic region was amplified and then hybridized to a membrane on which were attached probes that recognized mycobacterial species revealed by colorimetry .\nthe same principle was used to develop genotype mtbc tests ( hain lifescience gmbh , nehrin , germany ) , which use multiplex amplification of dna fragments ( 23s rrna gene , rd1 region , and gyrb gene ) to differentiate m. tuberculosis complex species ( mycobacterium tuberculosis , mycobacterium bovis ssp bovis , m. bovis bcg , bovis ssp caprae , mycobacterium africanum , mycobacterium canettii , and mycobacterium microti ) . the hsp65 gene - based pcr restriction pattern analysis ( pra )\nmcnabb and co - workers assessed the use of partial sequences of the hsp65 gene for the routine identification of mycobacteria and reported an overall agreement of 85.2% with other identification methods ; discrepancies were most frequently encountered with isolates of m. chelonae , mycobacterium fortuitum , mycobacterium gordonae , mycobacterium scrofulaceum , and mycobacterium terrae .\nthe amplification of the seca1 gene that codes for the essential protein seca1 , a key component of the major pathway of protein secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane , has also been tried .\nit was demonstrated that the seca1 gene of the genus mycobacterium can be used for species - level or complex - level ( for the mtb complex ) identification .\nit was also found that seca1 is a suitable target for diagnostics as the degree of interspecies variation for gene sequences among mycobacteria was observed to be moderate .\nthese conclusions came from nonexhaustive studies and a need for further inputs for the improvement of the same was felt . apart from costly and cumbersome probe - based methods , combining the detection of various characteristic features or the multiple species identification using multiplex pcr also seems to be promising .\nfor instance , to detect three mycobacterial species , the multiplex pcr is estimated to cost at least half that of a commercial dna probe which is used to identify only one of the three pathogens that can be identified by a multiplex pcr assay . in this regard , the use of the multiplex pcr could provide large savings in time , costs , and laboratory resources compared with the use of the expensive commercial dna probes , subcloning procedures , and biochemical tests .\nthe use of multiplex pcr to detect members of the mycobacterium genus and to detect and differentiate m. tuberculosis , mycobacterium avium , and mycobacterium intracellulare has also been investigated .\nhowever , there exist a few limitations with respect to dna isolation , species identification , and obtaining cultures from a sophisticated system like bactec as a source to begin with .\nthe recent development of the real - time pcr - based instrument named genexpert system , recently endorsed by the who , has led to the rapid detection of tb and drug resistance at the point of care . the mtb / rif test using this system provided sensitive detection of tb and rifampin resistance directly from the untreated sputum in less than 2 h with minimal hands - on time . who has recently issued a policy statement for the xpert mtb / rif system .\nthis statement provides a brief description of the results obtained from various analytical studies , controlled clinical validation trials , field demonstration studies , etc .\nanalysis with this system reports the detection of five genomic copies and 131 cfu / ml mtb spiked in sputum . based on the results , it has been recommended that \n xpert mtb / rif should be used as the initial diagnostic test in individuals suspected of mdr - tb or hiv - associated tb ( strong recommendation).xpert mtb / rif may be used as a follow - on test to microscopy in settings where mdr and/or hiv is of lesser concern , especially in smear - negative specimens ( conditional recommendation , recognizing major resource implications ) . \n \nxpert mtb / rif should be used as the initial diagnostic test in individuals suspected of mdr - tb or hiv - associated tb ( strong recommendation ) .\nxpert mtb / rif may be used as a follow - on test to microscopy in settings where mdr and/or hiv is of lesser concern , especially in smear - negative specimens ( conditional recommendation , recognizing major resource implications ) . however , conventional microscopy , culture , and dst , which are required to monitor treatment progress and to detect resistance to drugs other than rifampicin were found to be indispensible at this time .\nalso several operational conditions need to be maintained for proper functioning of the instrument . apart from this\n, the cost of the instrument and the cartridges used is another concern that is being negotiated and taken care of by agencies like find .\ncurrently , there is an urgent need for a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method for the identification of active m. tuberculosis disease that can be performed at the point of care , i.e. , outside the traditional laboratory setting .\nas serological methods have never shown to be very consistent in terms of their sensitivity and specificity for the detection of m. tuberculosis infection , research has again focused on finding new biomarkers for better detection .\ndeveloping a method that uses alternate clues like biomarkers is desperately needed as all available diagnostic methods require a sputum sample limiting applicability to patients with pulmonary disease who are able to provide sputum for analysis .\nvarious molecules from mycobacterial as well as the host origin are being explored and tested for the same to get the desired speed , accuracy , and consistency in diagnosing the disease and restricting it for the benefit of patient and their environment .\nin addition to the biomarkers used in the currently available diagnostic tests , the literature is rich with candidate biomarkers like early secretary proteins such as early secretory antigenic 6 kda ( esat-6 ) and culture filtrate protein 10 ( cfp-10 ) , malate synthase , etc . , and a few molecules emerging from the host in response to infection with varying degrees of validation with the potential for development into new diagnostic tests.[4346 ] the emergence of new knowledge about interactions of m. tuberculosis with its host with the advancing technology has provided new concepts of the clinical phenotypes , pathogenesis , and host immune responses in tuberculosis and the resulting opportunities for biomarker discovery .\nthe use of  omics  approaches may be needed for biomarker discovery in individuals who are exposed but not infected , who get infected but do not get the disease and in comparing them with those who succumb to the infection .\nalso , it is expected that these new biomarkers would be able to differentiate between active and latent tuberculosis .\nthe  omics  approach involves fetching out the signatures from transcriptomic , proteomic , or metabolomic profiling .\nhopefully , some biomarkers would provide us with a reliably consistent indication of infection and would help us detect the same before the infection proceeds to a level wherein we could easily detect afb in sputum or otherwise but late .\nalso , with a significantly higher number of hiv patients ( 2.3 million prevalent cases ) , it complicates the management of tb in hiv - infected individuals . with about 50% lifetime risk of developing tb disease in hiv - infected people ,\nit is projected that 50%60% of the hiv - infected persons in india will develop tb disease during their lifetime .\ncomparable data from various indian studies conducted between 1994 and 2006 also report the prevalence of hiv  tb co - infection in the range of 3%55% .\nscientific efforts have been put in by academia and research institutes in india for the development of better diagnostic tools .\nindia has been a big market for in vitro diagnostics but has been dominated by imported and generic products , mostly serological , with virtually no innovations .\nexamples of the development in the field of hepatitis and others from the indian industry have given a hope that indian diagnostic companies could also become world 's hub for high - quality generic diagnostics in the field of tb diagnostics .\nfor this to happen , the indian industry needs to venture into genuine innovation in the field .\nthis requires supportive policies , enhanced and timely funding , and greater collaboration between the workers and the funders from the public and private sector .\nrntcp , being an official caretaker in india for tb control , has been very active in the recent past . in line with the who 12-point policy package\n, rntcp has also adopted strategies to diagnose and manage tb in hiv - infected patients .\nthe program has immediate priorities of restricting tb infection by providing treatment to all infected individuals . for diagnosis , there exist the guidelines for intensive case finding at the community level , but for early diagnosis of tb in the indian population , not many efforts could be made .\nthis is very justifiable in light of huge numbers of already existing cases of tb .\nindian council of medical research ( icmr ) has also been working extensively on disease control programs with a support of the continued exploitation of scientific and technological advances from basic to applied research , from biomedical to health sciences , and from laboratory to field research .\nicmr is providing significant information through its laboratories engaged in tb research and also provides funding to various academic and research institutions for research in this area .\nthey are not only discussing the problem and its solutions among themselves , but also consulting the international community for disseminating their work and getting updates from all over the world . an international symposium on tb diagnostics held at international centre for genetic engineering and biotechnology ( icgeb ) , new delhi , india , in december 2010 titled  innovating to make an impact  discussed multiple aspects regarding the challenges in tb diagnostics .\na very positive feel for support in the field of diagnostic development came out of this . a consultative meeting held in january 2011 at national aids research institute , india , on  galvanizing evidence for hiv management  also incorporated a full session on tb supported by who .\npolicy makers , subject experts , program implementers , researchers , hiv and tb physicians from different parts of india , researchers from another resource - limited setting like south africa , and researchers from usa took part in the discussions .\nexclusive discussions on diagnosing extra - pulmonary tb , childhood tb , and hiv  tb were conducted as these pose serious challenges to developing universally applicable diagnostic tools for tb . the willingness and determination for better diagnosis and management of tb from laboratory workers to the policy makers\nthis systematic review has not tried to incorporate the strategy of meta - analysis as the reports or publications being considered here are not sufficient to cover the entire range of efforts being contributed .\nrecently , private enterprises are putting in a lot for the development of newer and better diagnostic tools in the field of tb .\nbut the data from this end are not available to statistically assemble the results of studies into a single estimate .\nalthough the review has not taken into view all upcoming and sophisticated technologies which are not evidence based , the aim is to land upon an idea of basic problems being identified in due course of diagnostic development .\ntable 1 reviews the frequently used techniques , problems associated with them , and an approach to solve these problems .\nalso , in normal diagnostic settings which use conventional methods of diagnosis , it is always difficult to maintain quality and ensuring biosafety in the absence of recommended equipments . in a very recent policy recommendation by who\n, a warning has been issued against the use of inaccurate blood tests for active tb , and these tests have been defined as \nsubstandard tests with unreliable results .  who has advised most of the countries which use these methods to ban the inaccurate and unapproved blood tests and instead rely on accurate microbiological or molecular tests , as recommended by who .\nas there is a big market for these tests in india , the focus is now going to be toward alternatives which can be placed in the market for active tb diagnosis .\nthis is going to generate a huge demand of better diagnostic methods . in the light of a recent report \ntotally drug resistant tuberculosis in india ,  followed by a big controversy about the origin and proper identification ,\nit becomes indispensible for a clinician to confirm about the status of infecting species along with the exact nature of drug resistance . at the same time\n, a clinician can not wait for culture - based reports to initiate the treatment .\nin such cases , pcr / marker - based techniques would help getting concrete evidences of the etiology and would direct the treatment options on the right track .\noverview of diagnostic methods and their limitations looking on the other side , wherein commercial automated liquid cultures are recommended for better quality with minimum handling and manipulation of cultures by laboratory technicians , the expense and sophistication required is not a bearable load for all . in such conditions ,\nalternative and novel culture - based approaches with a justifiable balance of cost , biosafety , and sensitivity are highly solicited .\nnucleic acid amplification test ( naat)-based methods seem to be the best and fastest options among all . the big question that arises then is how to facilitate the required resources .\nwe need to upgrade all research and diagnostic units all over the affected regions of the world to equip themselves with basic set - ups of pcr assays and to make confirmative diagnosis a routine and feasible option . in designing assays ,\nsometimes the worker is faced with a significant challenge in selecting the primer and probe combinations that detect all of the organisms to cover a broader range of significant organisms , avoiding cross - reactivity , sequence analysis , etc .\nanticipation and removal of inhibitory substances from the samples before the assay set - up is also a major issue to consider . for this , basic knowledge and training about molecular assays can be made a part of the basic training for technicians and scientists working in the field .\nalso naa tests are not considered for the evaluation of patients receiving therapy as the technology can not distinguish between live and dead organisms .\nthis can still be used with the same specificity if followed by short - term culture - based enrichment .\na possibility of having some method that incorporates both culture and modern methods of detection has been visualized during this review . a culture enriching the initial viable loads followed by a sensitive and specific naa test with a minimized need of containment can make identification safer , faster , and more reliable . with the recent enthusiasm of various policy makers , funding agencies , and grants ,\nthe need is now to foster innovations that deliver better tools to diagnose tb with confidence using affordable approaches .\nafter this only , the next step to treat and eradicate the menace of tb and associated risks can be taken with confidence .\nthis review has been written with an intention to make readers aware of the kind of methodological challenges involved in such diagnosis .\nthe author hopes that this will raise inquisitiveness in the brains of true scientific warriors to strive for newer ideas in making things simple and affordable ."}
{"id": 65, "text": "interferon- ( ifn- )  is an essential cytokine for immunity against intracellular pathogens and cancer .\nmice with targeted disruptions of the ifng gene or ifng gene receptor 1 are highly susceptible to a variety of bacteria , protozoans , and virus infection .\nfurthermore , when mice lacking sensitivity to ifn- were challenged with chemical carcinogens , they developed tumor more rapidly and with higher frequency than wild type animals [ 2 , 3 ] . ifn- is produced by cells that mediate both innate and adaptative immune responses .\nnatural killer ( nk ) and natural killer t ( nkt ) cells are the innate cells sources of this cytokine and rapidly produce ifn- upon activation . on the other hand significant increase in ifn- expression by cd4 t lymphocytes is observed only after t helper ( th ) 1 differentiation .\nin fact , upon activation , cd4 t cells can differentiate into several effector lineages , of which th1 is the only one that produce high levels of ifn-. nave cd8 t lymphocytes do not produce large amounts of ifn- , but after tcr stimulation these cells undergo differentiation into cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctl ) and memory cells , which are capable of producing high levels of this cytokine in response to tcr activation or interleukin- ( il- ) 12 and il-18 .\nthe best characterized role of ifn- in cd8 t cell immunity is in enhancing class i antigen presentation pathway , which facilitates cytotoxic t cells to recognize infected cells .\nifn- signaling upregulation leads to expression of mhc class i and the tap transporter , as well as chaperones such as tapasin .\nifn- also induces a replacement of the constitutive proteasome subunits , 1 , 2 and 5 , for the immunoproteasome subunits lmp2 , mecl-1 , and lmp7 , an essential feature for increasing the quantity and repertoire of peptides presented in the context of class i mhc ( reviewed in ) .\nifn- also plays an important role in cd8 t cell homeostasis that is independent from its function in clearance of infection .\nseveral studies have suggested that ifn- is a key determinant of immunodominance [ 68 ] .\nbadovinac and colleagues   have shown that ifn- deficient mice infected with an attenuated listeria monocytogenes strain exhibited an altered immunodominance hierarchy due to an increased expansion of cd8 t cells specific for a subdominant epitope of l. monocytogenes .\nfurthermore , ifn- seems to be required for subdominant cd8 t cells response suppression by dominant cd8 t cell response   and the cd8 t cells that promptly produce ifn- after stimulation are preferentially expanded .\nthis cytokine is important for the differentiation of tcrcd4cd8 intraepithelial lymphocytes ( iels ) in the gut .\niels are lymphocytes considered  activated yet resting  and their regulation is crucial role in the maintenance of the epithelial cell barrier and gut physiological inflammation .\nifn- also acts directly on cd8 t cells by stimulating their abundance in an acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( lcmv ) infection   and enhancing the development of memory cells .\ninterestingly , sercan and colleagues   show that ifn- produced by innate immune cells contributes to antigen - specific cd8 t cell homeostasis .\nhowever , badovinac and colleagues   also have shown that ifn- deficiency resulted in a delayed contraction of antigen - specific cd8 t cell populations from both listeria monocytogenes and lcmv infections , which suggests an important role of this cytokine in control of death phase of antigen - specific cd8 t cells .\ntherefore , this cytokine has both positive and negative effects on cd8 t cell abundance depending on the phase of the cd8 response and also the biology model evaluated .\nthis dual role is clearly evident in ifn- deficient mice , in which both the expansion and contraction of cd8 t cell response are impaired .\ncd8 t cells are usually characterized by their cytolytic activities involving perforin or fas mechanisms to kill targeted cells . however\ncytokine secretion by cd8 t cells also has an important role in the control of intracellular infections . in 1990 ,\nfong and mosmann   suggested that th1 cells and cd8 t cells could share cytokine mediated functions , like combating intracellular pathogens and tumors cells .\nthey observed that alloreactive murine cd8 t cell clones produced both mrna and protein profile characteristic of th1 clones , which include high levels of ifn-. it is well known that the clearance of several infections also depends on noncytolytic functions of cd8 t cells . the control of m. tuberculosis infections in mice requires the ability of the cd8 t cells to produce ifn- .\nfurthermore , ifn- produced by cd8 t cells is essential to clear numerous viral infections such as measles virus , herpes simplex virus type 1 , lcmv , and borna disease virus .\nthis ifn- mediated response seems to be important to avoid tissue damage and inflammation , which is normally observed in cytotoxic cd8 t cell response ( reviewed in ) .\nindeed , hiv control is associated with polyfunctional cd8 t cells , that is , epitope - specific cells expressing several effector functions , which includes the expression of cytokines such as tnf and ifn- .\nthe ifn- produced by cd8 t cells seems to have other immunomodulatory roles , acting on cd4 t cells and b cells and also on cd8 t cells themselves .\nthe differentiation of cd4 t cells in t helper subsets depends on the cytokine milieu where these primary t cells were stimulated .\nthe main sources of these cytokines are activated innate immune cells . for th1 differentiation ,\nthe cytokines il-12 , produced by apcs , and ifn- , mainly produced by nk cells , are critical to induce and reinforce th1 commitment .\nseveral studies have also suggested that cd8 t lymphocytes could have a role in the generation of th1 immunity and in the inhibition of th2 response [ 1820 ] .\nuzonna and colleagues   have shown that ifn- produced by murine cd8 t cells , in response to low doses of l. major , downregulates an initial th2 response and enhances th1 commitment .\ndata from our group suggest that , besides nk and dendritic cells , cd8 t lymphocytes are also another source of ifn- that enhances cd4 th1 phenotype development .\nwe have shown that , after tcr activation of primary lymph node cells , cd8 t lymphocytes are the major source of ifn- production .\nfurthermore , cd4 t cells cocultured with ifn--competent cd8 t cells clearly produce more ifn- and less il-4 than cd4 t cells cultured with ifn--deficient cd8 t cells .\nthis work also suggested that nfat1 transcription factor - dependent ifn- production by cd8 t cell is important during eosinophil migration to pleura in a pleurisy model , which suggests an important role for ifn- produced by cd8 t cells in the control of allergic diseases .\ntogether these studies reinforce the role of ifn- produced by cd8 t cells in regulation of th immune responses in vivo .\nthe autocrine ifn- signaling is important for th1 differentiation , and recently it has been suggested that ifn- is an autocrine / paracrine factor to promote nave t cd8 cell differentiation .\nlow levels of ifn- produced by cd8 t cells promote the upregulation of t - bet , granzyme b , and ifn- also promotes a week cytolytic activity .\nifn- alone does not support strong differentiation but can synergize with ifn- in driving effector differentiation of these cd8 t cells .\na previous paper has also shown that nave cd8 t cells receive an ifn- signal few hours after l. monocytogenes infection .\nthese studies suggest that the ifn- signals for cd8 t cell differentiation are delivered early in the immune response .\nwhen nave t cd4 and cd8 cells are compared for the ifn- production , it is clear that , after tcr activation , cd8 t cells produce more levels of ifn- than cd4 t cells , and the requirements for tcr induced ifn- production are different between these primary cells . in fact , carter and murphy   have shown that cd4 t cells require stat4 activation beside tcr signalization to produce ifn- , while cd8 t cells need only tcr activation .\nfurthermore , the main difference in transcriptional requirements for ifng expression between cd4 and cd8 t cells seems to be the differential role of members of the t - box family of transcription factors , t - bet and eomesodermin ( eomes ) .\nt - bet is the master regulator of ifng and th1 commitment of cd4 t cells   and sufficient for induction of ifng expression in these cells . on the other hand ,\nadditionally , eomes and t - bet play important roles during cd8 t cell differentiation to effector and memory t cells , where t - bet is associated with effector phenotype whereas expression of eomes increases in memory cd8 t cells .\nthere are several studies about ifn- production by th1 cells and the molecular mechanisms that control ifng expression in these cells\nare widely investigated and extensively reviewed . however , regulation of ifng expression in cd8 t cells is not fairly explored and discussed .\nan effective cellular immune response is characterized by robust stimulation of nave lymphocytes to undergo differentiation into effector cells , which provides pathogen clearance while promoting the development of long - lived memory cells that can respond to reinfection faster than nave cells .\nthe cd8 differentiation is accompanied by large - scale changes in the coordinate expression of genes associated with effector function , survival , and self - renewal   and recently it has been recognized that epigenetic modification is an integral part of this process .\nthis section will focus on the chromatin status of ifng promoter in cd8 t cells .\nhowever , due to the scarcity of studies exploring cd8 t cells and the higher availability of data investigating cd4 t cells , some aspects of cd4 regulation will be mentioned for comparison .\ndifferential gene expression can be regulated from the selective action of transcriptional factors and also from epigenetic mechanisms , such as dna methylation or posttranslational histone modifications .\nthese epigenetic modifications could be heritable and occur without affecting the dna sequence , which makes the epigenetic information potentially plastic .\nit is the whole set of epigenetic modifications at a given locus , including the interaction of atp - dependent nucleosomal remodeling complexes with dna methylation and histone modifications that play a key role in regulating gene expression and chromatin organization .\nmethylation of cytosine residues within cpg dinucleotides is an efficient epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing .\nthe methyl group addition at the 5 carbon of the pyrimidine ring of cytosine is catalyzed by enzymes called dna methyltransferases ( dnmts ) .\ndna methylation in the vicinity of transcriptional start sites results in repression and gene silencing by direct and indirect mechanisms .\nthe direct mechanism is done by affecting the binding of transcription factors that do not recognize methylated cpg sites .\nthese proteins prevent the binding of transcription factors to dna and can recruit several enzymes that catalyze transcriptionally silent histone modifications and other factors that make the chromatin more compact and consequently less accessible to transcription machinery .\nthe importance of cpg methylation for ifng expression is supported by experiments of cd8 t cell cultures stimulated via tcr in the presence of 5-azacytidine ( 5-aza ) , a drug that causes dna demethylation upon proliferation . upon aza treatment , increased levels of this cytokine in culture supernatants were described , as well as an increment in the number of nave cells able to produce ifn- when compared to control .\nseveral genomic regions could be involved in this regulation and a possible role of ifng mouse promoter was particularly investigated .\nnumeration of these sites varies among different publications , but here we will denominate it according to the initial transcription site from the refseq sequence identifier nm_008337 .\ncd8 t cell clonal analysis of ifng promoter methylation by bisulfite genomic dna sequencing and mrna expression by quantitative competitive pcr ( qcpcr ) revealed an overall association between demethylation of ifn- promoter and expression of mrna .\ncpg sites located at 212 , 198 , and 58 were methylated in most ifn--negative mrna clones and their demethylation was closely related to ifn- expression .\nhowever , there is a clonal heterogeneity , with clone- and site - specific differences across the promoter .\ninterestingly much more variability was observed when clones derived from nave cd8cd44 t cells were assayed .\non the other hand , most of the cpg sites in ifng promoter of clones derived from cd8cd44 t cells were demethylated and these clones expressed high levels of ifn-. in line with that winders and colleagues   showed by southern blot analysis with methylation - sensitive enzymes that ifn- promoter is mostly unmethylated at the 301 , 212 , and 58 sites in cd8 t cells from ot - i mice .\nsimilar patterns were observed in cd4 t cells from 5c.c7 mice , and earlier stages of t cell development also revealed hypomethylation at the 212 to 50 cpg sites .\nbut the upstream site 380 was hypermethylated in both double positive and double negative thymocytes . in accord with the hypothesis that cpg methylation occurs in ifn- nonproducers ,\nalso , stimulation of cd4 t cells in th2 polarizing conditions leads to a pronounced increase of methylation at particular sites .\nkersh and colleagues   performed by bisulfite sequencing an ex vivo analysis of nave and in vivo generated effector and memory cd8 t cells from p14 tcr - transgenic mice , which are specific for gp33 - 41 epitope of lcmv glycoprotein .\nbut these cells have posttranscriptional sites ( + 12 , + 91 , and + 114 ) mainly methylated .\nalthough the average numbers of methyl - cpg sites in nave and memory cells were the same ( 2.8 and 2.7 , resp . )\nsimilar to data from northrop and colleagues , effector cd8 cells had a completely unmethylated promoter .\nthe discrete differences in dna methylation between nave and memory cd8 cells may represent a differential regulation in these cell types , because after 5 hours of antigenic - stimulation , a demethylation independent of dna replication was observed in memory cells , but this is not true for nave p14 cells .\nfurthermore , treatment of nave p14 cells with 5-aza led to an increase in the number of cells able to produce ifn- , and no difference was observed when memory cells were used suggesting that ifng is silenced by dna methylation in nave , but not cd8 , memory cells .\nnot only the number but also the amount of intracellular ifn- produced by nave p14 cells treated with 5-aza has increased , when compared to control . in line with that ,\nmakar and wilson   reported that when nave cd8 t cells deficient in the maintenance dnmt 1 ( dnmt1 ) are stimulated for 3 days they increase ifng expression 510-fold after restimulation .\nbut it is important to note that even in dnmt1 deficient mice the ifn- production is higher in cd8 than cd4 lymphocytes , suggesting that maintenance of ifn- expression in specific t cell subsets is not dependent on cpg methylation . in opposition ,\nth2-related cytokines ( il-4 , il-5 , and il-13 ) were significantly expressed only when cd8 t cells lacks dnmt1 .\nthe other study characterizing cpg methylation of ifn- promoter in several cell types investigated the methylation status of the 212 , 198 , 178 , 58 , 50 , 39 , + 12 , and + 91 cpg sites .\nall the cpgs were almost completely methylated in kidney and heart tissues , and entirely unmethylated in nk cells .\nconsistent with other reports [ 32 , 33 ] , cpgs located at untranscribed regions were hypomethylated and those at transcribed regions were hypermethylated in cd8 nave cells from c57/bl6 mice .\nalthough a different mouse lineage was used to obtain memory cd8 t cells , they presented 06% and 3070% methylation in untranscribed and transcribed region , respectively .\nas previously reported , earlier stages of t cell development ( dn , dp , cd4 , and cd8 thymocytes ) have also hypomethylated cpg sites at ifn- promoter .\ncd4 t lymphocytes from the same mice presented a similar cpg methylation pattern of c57/bl6 cd8 nave cells , but polarization to th1 results in a significant level of demethylation in transcribed region .\nlike other reports , th2 underwent some level of methylation at untranscribed region , with the position 58 being more methylated than other promoter sites , while no detectable change was observed when differentiation occurred at neutralizing conditions ( th0 ) .\ntaken together , all these data suggest that nave cd8 t cells exhibit a low methylation profile in untranscribed region and a hypermethylation in transcribed region , and , following tcr stimulation , methylation decreases in both regions .\nthe functional significance of ifn- promoter cpg methylation was assayed by luciferase reporter assays showing that methylation of the whole ifn- promoter vector inhibits its transcriptional activity [ 33 , 36 ] .\nmethylation of the 212 , 198 , and 178 sites individually did not affect the activity of ifng promoter , and little effect was observed when the 50 and 39 sites were exclusively methylated , but modification of 58 cpg site significantly reduced the activity to a level similar to that of the observed for the completely methylated vector .\ninterestingly , methylation of 58 site occurred faster and more completely than the other sites during th1 and th2 polarization , but a more accentuated outcome was observed in th2 [ 33 , 36 ] .\nthe versatile profile of the 58 site could potentially interfere with transcription . the use of oligonucleotide probes with methylated 58 cpg , but not 50 and 39 , abolished the formation of 2 complexes verified when unmethylated probes were used in emsa with nuclear extracts of th1 cell line ae7 . in supershift assays\nc - jun and atf2 were identified in the upper band and creb and atf1/creb in the lower one , and this was also observed when th2 nuclear extracts from d10 lineage were used .\nchromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) assays confirmed the creb and creb / atf1 binding and identified fosb , junb , c - jun , and atf2 interacting with ifn- promoter in th1 cell lineage in vivo . concerning the th2 cell lineage ,\nthe mentioned functional and binding assays were performed in th cells , and although they are related to cd8 lymphocytes , several data suggest that ifng regulation may have particular characteristics in each t cell subset , like data obtained from transgenic mice model which express the luciferase gene under the control of proximal ( 70 to 44 ) and distal ( 98 to 78 ) regulatory elements from the ifn- promoter . in vitro\nprimed cd4 t cells express reporters under control of both elements , while cd8 cells do so only under the distal element .\nin addition , elevated cyclic amp inhibited transcriptional activity directed by the proximal regulatory element in primed cd4 + t cells but enhanced transcriptional activity directed by the distal in primed cd8 + t cells .\nthis differential gene expression depends on the selective action of transcriptional factors , but also from epigenetic modifications that could change the chromatin accessibility to transcriptional machinery .\ndepending on both covalent modification type and the modified residue , these modifications could result in gene activation or silencing .\n( ach3 and ach4 , resp . ) and methylation of lysine 4 of histone h3 are histone modifications associated with poised or transcriptionally active genes . on the other hand , trimethylation of lysines 9 or 27 of histone h3\nin fact , reduced repressive h3k27me3 and h3k27me2 throughout ifng after primary infection and persistence in memory cd8 t lymphocytes was reported , as well as a detection of minor h3k4me3 peaks near ifng tss in effector and memory t cd8 cells .\nin addition to the loss of dna methylation at ifn- promoter in the differentiation of nave p14 cd8 t cells to effector , northrop and colleagues   reported a more pronounced demethylation of the ifn- enhancer at the first intron .\ninvestigation of ach3 by chip and detection by real - time pcr revealed a significant increase in ifn- promoter after stimulation , and similar increase was observed in the comparison of nave cd8 t cells with effector and memory cd8 t cells in promoter and enhancer . nevertheless , when cd8 memory and effector cells were generated in cd4 deficient mice ( b6 cd4 ) , they produced  considerably \nless ifn- per cell and the shift in histone acetylation is no longer seen , suggesting that demethylation of cpg sites within ifn- promoter and enhancer in cd8 effector and memory cells occurred independently of cd4 t help , while histone acetylation at these same regions was highly dependent upon the presence of cd4 help .\nthis effect is cytokine specific , because hypoacetylation of il-2 does not change in differentiated cd8 cells .\nalthough the above data suggest that epigenetic regulation of the ifng promoter may interfere in its expression , transgenes containing the 8.6-kb fragment of human genomic dna containing the full length ifn- gene ( promoter , introns , and up to 3.4  kb of 5 flanking sequence ) do not confer proper t cell subset - specific expression in vivo [ 4143 ] .\nindeed , a transgenic model containing the human ifng gene and 9095  kb of flanking sequence results in high - level , th1-specific ifn- production . therefore , the search for conserved noncoding sequences ( cns ) among different species has been proved as a good method for identification of relevant cis - regulatory elements for ifn- gene . \n in silico searches for cnss across human , mouse , and rat genomes allowed the identification of 2 sequences located at 5.27  kb [ 44 , 45 ] and 17.36  kb of murine ifng translational start site .\nthe first one is referred to as cns-1 or ifn- 5 cns and the second , cns-2 .\nboth of them exhibited enhancer like function in luciferase reporter assays in response to ionomycin in t cell lineages and correspond to a dnase i hypersensitive site in th1 cells but not in th2 cells [ 44 , 45 ] .\nsimilar pattern of ach3 ( and more slightly ach4 ) and h3k4me2 is observed in cd8 and th1 cells , which are good sources of ifn- [ 40 , 44 ] .\ninterestingly , despite the fact that in vitro primed effector cd8 t cells have more levels of ach3 at intron 3 compared to cns-1 , tcr tg effector cd8 t cells primed in vivo displayed greater ach3 at cns-1 compared to intron 3 . increased levels of mentioned modifications were detected at promoter , intron 3 , and cns-2 regions while th2 has more discrete peaks .\ninterestingly , h3ac chip analysis of th1 , th2 , and cd8 cells from mice deficient in t - bet revealed that this transcription factor is required for induction of histone modifications in th1 , but not t cd8 cells . despite some similarities between cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes ,\ncd8 cells seem to have particular regulation of ifn  production . therefore , more research is needed to characterize possible pathways engaged in this control .\nhatton and colleagues   identified a cns located at 22  kb from ifng that when deleted blocks ifng reporter expression in th1 and cd8 t cells .\ntransgenic mouse model also suggests that this element is required for ifn- expression in cd4 and cd8 t cells . in 2007 , schoenborn and colleagues   also performed a comparative genomic analysis that revealed eight highly conserved noncoding sequences ( cnss ) in a ~100  kb region surrounding ifng .\npreviously identified cns-1 ( also called cns-6 ) , 22 , 34 , 54 , and + 18/20 ( also called cns-2 ) were among them , but they further identify the cns+29 , + 46 , and + 55 . although the aim of the study was to characterize regulatory elements that govern ifng expression in cd4 t cells , functional elements identified were also investigated in primary cd8 t cells : cns-6 enhanced expression in stimulated cd8 cells as well as in th0 or th1 cells , but the authors report that cns-34 did so only in cd8 . on the other hand , cns22 enhanced expression in response to il-12 plus il-18 in th0 and th1 cells , but this effect was not consistently evident in cd8 + t cells .\nthese results suggest that some sequences like cns-22 may be necessary for ifng expression in both cd4 and cd8 t cells , while others , as cns-34 , may have regulatory role only in cd8 t lymphocytes .\nmoreover , more studies are needed to explore cnss functions and epigenetic marks in cd8 t cells .\nthere are relatively concordant data concerning cpg methylation of ifng promoter , but fewer studies investigated the status of other relevant sequences for ifn- expression in cd8 lymphocytes .\nthere is also a relative lack of data concerning other epigenetic marks , as histone modifications , and the interplay between factors that may determine or influence this status in cd8 t cells .\nit would be of particular interest to investigate if epigenetic events can influence heterogeneous features of cd8 t cell populations , like the capacity of polyfunctional cells to express several cytokines , and if specific microenvironments could modulate the ifng expression through epigenetic marks , as in iels .\nthese observations reinforce that more studies are needed to understand the transcriptional regulation of ifng in cd8 t cell lineage ."}

{"id": 67, "text": "concurrence of more than one disease in the liver ( thereafter  overlap ) may have a significant impact on disease progression . due to a progressive increase in the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) associated with \nendemic obesity , overlapped nafld , especially in its necroinflammatory form of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) , has gained clinical relevance in the diagnosis and prognosis of chronic liver disease .\nin fact , patients with chronic hepatitis c and nash have more advanced stages of fibrosis accompanied by more severe metabolic syndrome than those with chronic hepatitis c or chronic hepatitis c and nonalcoholic steatosis .\nregarding overlap with other forms of chronic liver disease , nash - autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) overlap syndrome has received special attention for several reasons .\nfirst , histological diagnosis of nash - aih overlap is absolutely required , owing to previous reports that autoantibodies were present in about one quarter of patients with nafld   and that without liver biopsy , almost all the female patients were incorrectly diagnosed with aih .\nsecond , the optimum treatment regimen to achieve biochemical remission has been difficult to standardize ; corticosteroids are likely to worsen nash   but improve aih - related necroinflammation .\nthird , the natural course and postintervention prognosis remain to be characterized . to our knowledge\n, 8 cases of biopsy - proven nafld - aih overlap syndrome have been reported to date [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] , 3 with nash and 5 with nafld ( the latter without detailed information on the presence of steatohepatitis ) . among these ,\n2 cases of nash - aih overlap were treated with corticosteroid , but histological changes as revealed by follow - up liver biopsies have not yet been reported . in this report\nwe describe a patient with nash - aih overlap who successfully achieved histological remission of aih as well as resolution of nash with a combination of prednisolone therapy and weight loss .\nthis is the first report demonstrating that corticosteroids improve the prognosis of nash - aih overlap .\na 57-year - old female patient was referred to our hospital with a 2-year history of low - grade but gradually progressing aminotransferase elevation . on admission ,\nclinical examination was normal but blood tests revealed elevated liver enzymes , i.e. , ast 174 iu / l ( normal < 37\niu / l ) , and -gtp 120 iu / l ( normal < 75 iu / l ) .\nher serum autoantibody profile was as follows : anti - nuclear antibody 1,280 ( speckled ) , anti - smooth muscle antibody 80 , and anti - ss - a 64 , but anti - mitochondria antibody was negative .\nserum igg was increased to 2,370 mg / dl ( normal < 1,700 mg / dl ) and human leukocyte antigen was found to be dr3/dr4 .\nelevated fasting blood glucose ( 123 mg / dl ) coupled with increased hba1c ( 7.3% ) indicated comorbid diabetes mellitus .\nthe homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( homa - r ) was 11.4 , though the patient was not significantly obese ( body mass index was 23.6 ) .\nas abdominal ct scan and ultrasonography both suggested the presence of fatty liver , subsequent liver biopsy was required to narrow down the differential diagnosis that included nafld , aih , and their concurrence .\nsteatosis and pericellular / bridging fibrosis were also prominent , accompanied by hepatocyte ballooning , implicating concurrence with the histological features of steatohepatitis .\na diagnosis of nash - aih overlap was made ( aih score was 18 , i.e. , definite , together with nash grade 2/stage 3 according to the blunt classification system ) , and 30 mg of prednisolone per day p.o . was initiated .\nprednisolone exacerbated the patient 's diabetes during the 1st week of treatment , necessitating the administration of rapid - acting insulin .\nas aminotransferase levels began to decrease shortly after the initiation of treatment , prednisolone was gradually tapered to 15 mg / day over 6 months until liver enzymes normalized .\nprednisolone was further tapered to 5 mg / day over the next 12 months , without any hepatitis flare -

aih overlap patient who successfully achieved histological remission of both aih and nash following prednisolone therapy . to our knowledge , this report is the first to document the detailed clinical course of nash - aih overlap during prednisolone therapy , accompanied by documentation of histological improvement .\ninformation regarding treatment regimen was presented in 6 out of 8 nafld - aih overlap cases in the literature [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] : 2 patients were given prednisolone combined with diet therapy , resulting in a partial biochemical response .\non the other hand , 1 out of 2 patients treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and modified diet was reported to show normalized aminotransferases .\nthe remaining 2 cases were not treated , in 1 case due to coexisting diabetes and dyslipidemia despite the presence of definite aih . due to the anti - inflammatory action of glucocorticoid , fibrosis in aih commonly\nimproves or does not progress during therapy [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] . reflecting glucocorticoids cell- and tissue - specific mode of action through the glucocorticoid receptor ,\npersistently elevated glucocorticoid levels have been associated with fatty liver development and their consequent phenotype in nafld . moreover , dose - dependent association of glucocorticoid with secondary nash was demonstrated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus , and hepatic fat accumulation has been documented in patients with cushing 's syndrome . in accordance with clinical findings ,\nlemke et al .   recently reported that liver - specific glucocorticoid receptor knock - down by shrna , through induction of transcriptional repressor hairy enhancer of split 1 ( hes1 ) , caused a pronounced decrease in hepatic triglyceride levels in the livers of obese db / db mice .\nthe above findings raise concerns about the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of nafld - aih overlap . in our case the clinical benefit of prednisolone 's immunosuppressive and fibrolytic action clearly outweighed its steatogenic properties .\nour findings thus emphasize the need of appropriate immunosuppressive treatment even in comorbid aih and nash , though interindividual differences and genetic susceptibility may affect the glucocorticoids steatogenic actions .\nit should be noted that our study used a shorter duration and lower total dosage of prednisolone administration for aih compared to that for systemic lupus erythematosus , and this may not exacerbate concurrent nash if it is accompanied with appropriate diet therapy , the gold standard treatment for nash .\nloria et al .   reported that 3 out of 84 nafld patients ( 3.6% ) were diagnosed with true nash - aih overlap after liver biopsy , whereas 1 out of 212 japanese nafld patients ( 0.5% ) had definite aih .\ngiven ethnic differences in susceptibility to the development of nash - aih overlap , the increasing prevalence of nafld worldwide probably makes nash - aih overlap more clinically relevant .\nobviously , the false diagnosis of overlapped aih in female nash patients who have not undergone liver biopsy should be avoided , but true diagnosis of nash - aih accompanied by appropriate corticosteroid induction is needed to prevent disease progression .\nwe presented a patient with nash - aih overlap who achieved histological remission as a result of prednisolone therapy .\nfuture prospective studies and the accumulation of definite cases are needed to validate the effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy for nash -

{"id": 68, "text": "increase in the number of the elderly and in the prevalence of chronic diseases presses healthcare systems to offer individuals with chronic diseases more comprehensive care through primary healthcare ( phc ) [ 13 ] . to meet these needs , different models of chronic disease management\nthe most widely known is the  chronic care model  that advocates an integrated approach to care at all levels of the healthcare system for comprehensive and multidisciplinary management of chronic diseases .\nit also advocates for the establishment of organizational mechanisms to support provision of services and interorganizational linkage to achieve better coordination and integration of services .\nrelated to the  chronic care model ,  other models have been proposed for the delivery of primary healthcare , including the  patient - centered care medical home\nall proposed models focus on common elements , including sharing of responsibilities between healthcare professionals in a multidisciplinary teamwork perspective , active role of individuals in monitoring of their diseases , importance of communication facilitated by a clinical information system , and integration of services in an organizational framework that supports clinical practices and fosters linkages with other components of healthcare systems [ 3 , 10 ] . based on these models ,\ntwo new forms of phc practices were created in the early 2000s in quebec : family medicine groups ( fmgs ) aimed at improving continuity of care and network clinics ( ncs ) intended to provide greater accessibility of services .\na fmg is composed of 6 to 10 physicians with no geographical catchment area for patients they can register ( between 10,000 and 15,000 patients by fmg ) . the fmg can count on a grant from the ministry of health and social services to support its operations , in exchange for a contractual engagement to register a predetermined number of patients and to provide a minimum of specified services .\nit also provides greater accessibility through extended hours and participation in a regional on - call system . as of november 2010\n, there were 217 accredited fmgs , including 25 in montral and 35 in montrgie , the two regions that participated in this study .\nthe nc is a complementary phc practice model implemented in both regions , but mainly in montral at the initiative of the regional health and social services agency .\nit specifically aimed to improve accessibility , through providing walk - in services and ensuring access to radiology and laboratory tests as well as medical specialist services .\nit receives financial support from the regional agency . in august 2010 , there were 33 ncs in montral and 4 in montrgie . the distinction between fmg and nc\nis often blurred , especially as some phc practices have a dual fmg - nc status , thus benefiting from two sources of funding .\nthe complementarity between fmgs and ncs was to allow the provision of more complete and better integrated care , particularly for individuals with chronic diseases [ 1113 ] . in november 2010 , 19 phc practices had a fmg - nc status in montral and none in montrgie .\nseveral studies have explored the association between structural features of phc practices and experience of care [ 1418 ] .\nstudies have also assessed the impact of implementing specific components of the chronic care model on various care processes and outcomes [ 1921 ] .\nfew studies have looked at phc practice organizational attributes to assess their potential for managing chronic diseases [ 3 , 4 ] .\nan ontario study found that chronic disease management was superior in community health centers compared to other types of practices mainly due to the presence of nurse practitioners and interdisciplinary teams . in the context of a large study conducted in 2005 in two quebec regions\n, we examined the overall patient experience of care in phc practices and found a better continuity of care among practices that were more integrated and coordinated , but the model that focused on walk - in visits provided more accessible care [ 13 , 23 ] .\nthis study reported on the situation prevailing in 2005 and did not address the impact of the new phc practices as it was too early to assess the change .\na related cohort study found that fmgs represented an integrated model of phc delivery associated with higher levels of achievement in chronic care . in close collaboration with the regional health and social services agencies of the two most heavily populated quebec regions , montral and montrgie\n, we conducted a second study in 2010 to assess the evolution of the phc reform and its impacts on patients ' experience of care , unmet needs , and use of services .\nthe main objective of this paper is to assess the extent to which new phc practice models implemented in the two regions ( fmg - nc , fmg , and nc ) have improved patient experience of care , unmet needs , and use of services for individuals with and without chronic diseases , compared with other forms of phc practices that did not undergo such a change .\nthe study design corresponds to a before - after natural experiment in which fmgs , ncs , and fmg - ncs constituted the experimental group and the other practices formed the control group ( figure 1 ) .\nthe study consisted of population and organization surveys conducted in 2005 and 2010 in montral and montrgie . at that time , the two regions were divided into 23 local territories ( 12 in montral and 11 in montrgie ) under the governance of health and social services centres .\nthe population surveys were carried out on independent samples of the 2005 and 2010 populations .\nthey included 9,206 adults aged 18 or more in 2005 with a response rate of 64% and 9,180 in 2010 with a response rate of 56% .\nfor the purpose of this study , we excluded respondents who did not have a regular source of care since only those who had a regular source of care reported on their experience of care .\nwe also excluded those whose usual source of care was not identified at both time periods .\nshort telephone surveys of all phc organizations were also carried out : 659 organizations in 2005 and 606 organizations in 2010 .\nbasic information such as type of practice ( solo , group , fmg , and nc ) , number of practicing family physicians , having a nurse in the clinic , and offering walk - in services was gathered through telephone calls to the receptionists of all practices .\npopulation survey samples were stratified with approximatively 400 respondents in each of the 23 local territories regardless of their total population .\nthe questionnaire was constructed drawing mainly on two validated instruments : the primary care assessment survey and the primary care assessment tool , to which we added questions when the topic had not been addressed [ 2628 ] .\nit focused on respondents ' attachment to a phc practice , experience of care , and use of services in the two years preceding the surveys as well as unmet needs in the six months preceding the survey .\nthe population questionnaire documented also individual characteristics such as gender , age , level of education , economic status , perceived health , and presence of morbidities .\npopulation surveys data were linked with information gathered on phc organization through respondents ' identification of their regular source of primary care in the two years preceding the survey ( 20032005 and 20082010 ) . failing to precisely identify a usual source of primary care\n, respondents identified the phc practice most frequently attended in the two years preceding the survey .\nphc organizations were classified into two groups : an experimental group that included new model practices ( fmgs , ncs , and fmg - ncs ) and a control group that included all other practices ( local community services centres ( lcscs ) , family medicine units ( fmus ) , and solo and group practices that were not fmg or nc ) .\nfmus are academic training units that are likely to reflect current practice of family medicine and thus espouse hosting practices ' dominant philosophy of care .\nfor the purposes of this study , fmgs implemented in lcsc and fmu were included in the experimental group .\nthese represented 11 lcscs out of 49 and 9 fmus out of 12 . in 2010 , among the different phc organization models in montral and montrgie , group and solo practices that were not fmg or nc were dominant , as they represented 73% of all organizations and were the usual source of care for 50% of all service users .\nregardless of their status ( fmg , nc , or none ) , they are privately run by physicians , who are paid on a fee - for - service basis .\ninformation concerning patients ' experience of care , use of services , and unmet needs was gathered from population surveys .\nexperience of care and utilization referred to the two years preceding the survey and unmet needs to the six months preceding the survey .\nvariables of experience of care were accessibility , continuity , comprehensiveness , responsiveness , and perceived care outcomes .\nthe 28 selected indicators of experience of care were grouped under five dimensions : accessibility ( 6 items ) , continuity ( 5 items ) , comprehensiveness ( 5 items ) , responsiveness ( 7 items ) , and perceived care outcomes ( 5 items ) .\nwe carried out factor analysis within each of the five dimensions and calculated cronbach 's alpha which reached values of 0.60 or more for continuity ( 0.61 ) , comprehensiveness ( 0.79 ) , responsiveness ( 0.63 ) , and care outcomes ( 0.82 ) but was low for accessibility ( 0.30 ) , presumably reflecting the formative nature of this index .\nrespondents were asked if a doctor had told them they were suffering from specific chronic diseases .\nwe then classified chronic diseases as follows : heart disease ( coronary artery disease , heart failure ) , respiratory disease ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma ) , musculoskeletal disease ( arthritis , osteoarthritis , and rheumatism ) , cardiometabolic diseases ( hypertension , diabetes , and hypercholesterolemia ) , and other chronic diseases which was a residual and more heterogeneous category that included all remaining chronic diseases such as cancer , anemia , and gastrointestinal disorders .\nmental illnesses were not excluded ; they were considered as comorbidities associated with all the above categories , including the no chronic disease one ; to be included in the broad category  with chronic disease , \nall others were included in the no chronic disease category . to test for differences in the evolution of experimental and control groups between 2003 and 2010\n, we applied the difference - in - differences ( dd ) technique and matched individuals with the propensity score method to ensure better comparability of the two groups [ 3236 ] .\nthis method is particularly well suited to compare change in outcomes over time between individuals exposed to an intervention ( the experimental group ) and individuals that were not ( control group ) .\nindividuals were matched on the basis of propensity scores that estimate the probability for an individual with given characteristics to be attached to a phc organization of the experimental group .\nthe propensity score acts as a balancing score that renders the distribution of observed baseline covariates similar between the experimental group and the control group .\nthe propensity score was calculated with logistic regression using sex , age , level of education , economic situation , immigration status , perception of health status , and morbidities as predictors .\nthe subjects were then matched applying the kernel method , in which treated subjects are matched with a weighted average of all controls with weights that are inversely proportional to the distance between the propensity scores of treated individuals and controls .\nas the groups were very similar at the onset , nearly all subjects could be correctly matched .\ndifference - in - differences analyses were conducted separately on respondents with and without chronic diseases .\neffect size , which expresses the magnitude of change , was measured in percentage and calculated by dividing dd scores by the average value of the indicators in the experimental and control groups at the baseline time period .\n\n table 1 presents the percentage of respondents with a regular source of primary care .\nas expected , the percentage is higher for those with than for those without chronic diseases at both time periods . for both groups\ntable 2 shows , among those who had a regular source of primary care , percentages of users with different chronic diseases in the 2005 and 2010 surveys . \n\ntable 3 presents for each category of chronic diseases in the two time periods the percentage of those who , aside from that disease , also present other chronic morbidities .\ndata for the two time periods are generally comparable except for  cardiometabolic  and  other chronic diseases .\n tables 4 and 5 present data on other users ' characteristics for differences between control and experimental groups of the two samples .\nthe impact of the introduction of new phc models for individuals with chronic diseases was tested by comparing , in 20032005 and 20082010 , individuals attached to fmg - nc , fmg , and nc ( experimental group ) to those attached to other practices that had not changed ( control group ) with regard to experience of care , unmet needs , and use of services . as shown in table 6 , accessibility presents the lowest score among indices of experience of care .\nit decreased in both control and experimental groups over the years , but the experimental group remained with higher score and statistically significant differences at both times ( p = 0.048 ; p = 0.004 ) .\nhowever , the change was not sufficient to yield a significant dd value ( p = 0.640 ) .\ncontinuity was high in both groups . at both times , scores were higher for the control group , and the difference even increased in 20082010 ( p = 0.001 ; p < 0.001 ) .\nthe dd value approached the 0.05 level of significance ( p = 0.08 ) with a small negative effect size of 1.5% .\nthe pattern for comprehensiveness and responsiveness is very similar to that of continuity with nonsignificant dd values .\nthis resulted in a significant dd value of 1.6 in favor of the control group ( p = 0.044 ) and an effect size of 1.8% .\nfor unmet needs and utilization indicators , the results show no significant results except for high utilization of the usual source of primary care that decreased in both groups , but more so in the experimental group ( 7.9 ) than in the control group ( 4.0 ) , resulting in a significant and negative dd value ( p = 0.049 ) , corresponding to a 12.7% decrease .\ndata presented in table 7 show overall decline in accessibility over time in both experimental and control groups .\nhowever , the decline was larger in the control than in the experimental group while it was very small in the experimental group , yielding a positive and significant dd value ( p < 0.001 ) with a 5.5% increase .\nas regards continuity , the differences between groups remain constant over time in favor of the control group and this lack of change resulted in a nonsignificant dd value ( p = 0.563 ) .\nthe difference between groups for responsiveness turned in favor of the experimental group in 20082010 , resulting in a positive and significant dd value ( p = 0.007 ) with a positive 2.3% change . aside from these results , the evolution in both groups for all other indicators has been comparable , with no significant dd values .\npatients with chronic diseases in the experimental group had a worse experience of care than those in the control group in 20082010 on all indicators , except accessibility that was better and responsiveness that showed no difference .\nthe percentage of users who reported unmet needs was lower in the control group and hospitalization was slightly higher in the experimental group , but these differences were not significant .\nlooking at the evolution of experience of care for patients with chronic diseases in the two groups , measured by dd values , we observed that continuity increased more in the experimental than in the control group although the dd value failed to reach the 0.05 level of significance ( p = 0.081 ) .\nperceived care outcomes increased more in the control than in the experimental group resulting in a negative and significant dd value .\nthe percentage of users attending more often their usual source of primary care also declined more in the experimental than in the control group and these results are statistically significant ( p = 0.049 ) with a percentage of change close to 13% . the findings for patients with no chronic disease contrast with those of patients with chronic diseases .\nin 20082010 , accessibility was better in the experimental group than in control group ( p < 0.001 ) , but continuity was worse ( p < 0.001 ) .\ndd values are positive and statistically significant for accessibility with a 5% effect size , indicating less unfavorable evolution for the experimental group ( p < 0.001 ) .\ncontinuity shows no difference between groups in its evolution , nor with all the other indicators of experience of care , unmet needs , and utilization .\nfirst , it is disappointing to see that while continuity improved in the population it did so more in the control than in the experimental groups .\nthe main objective pursued by the reform in providing additional resources to new model practices was precisely to improve continuity of care , especially among individuals with chronic diseases [ 11 , 12 ] . a possible explanation for this result could be that financial incentives to enrollment of patients with chronic diseases were extended to all phc organizations , thus offsetting the advantage enjoyed up to that point by fmgs .\nanother explanation may be increased provision of services by nurses in fmgs and ncs that are not included in our measures of continuity .\nthese findings regarding continuity do not support those of an earlier study conducted by tourigny et al . among 1,275 patients followed up in five fmgs .\nthat study found an increase in continuity among patients 18 months after their enrollment in fmgs .\n. 's study did not have a control group and was limited to only five fmgs . a second unanticipated result concerns accessibility which showed less unfavorable evolution for patients without chronic diseases in the experimental group than for patients with chronic diseases .\nagain , the establishment of new models of phc organizations , and particularly of ncs , was aimed at improving accessibility to care for the general population , but in priority to the neediest individuals .\nit is rather ironic that the ones more in need were more affected by the unfavorable evolution of accessibility .\nanother finding that raises concerns is the lack of impact of the reform on unmet needs and use of services .\nconversely , the larger decrease in the percentage of the high users of services at the usual source of primary care in the experimental group can be considered as a positive outcome , possibly associated with more comprehensive and preventive care .\nit could also result from substitution between services provided by physicians and those provided by nurses or other health professionals .\nhowever , the impact of this outcome remains marginal if not coupled to decrease in er attendance and hospitalization that represent the most costly services .\nour findings regarding accessibility and utilization corroborate studies reporting on fmgs . in an ecological study of the entire quebec population , dunkley - hickin found that a higher degree of physicians ' participation in fgm in a geographical area was not associated with improved accessibility among users of services living in that area . in a large scale cohort study involving 79 fmgs ,\nstrumpf observed no improvement in accessibility but a slight reduction in use of primary care and specialist services .\n. followed up a cohort of 122,722 patients enrolled in fmgs compared to 675,102 who were not .\nthey found a small reduction in number of emergency visits for those attached to fmgs , but , as in our study , no change in hospitalization .\nnone of those studies has reported specifically on patients with chronic diseases compared to those without chronic diseases . in an earlier study conducted on the 2005 sample\nwe concluded that the  coordination - integrated model ,  which matched the attributes of the ideal type of fmgs that were to be implemented at that time , emerged as the model with the greatest potential to concomitantly achieve high levels of accessibility and continuity for patients with chronic diseases .\nit could be that the reform had an effect on both phc organizations that have become fmgs or ncs and those that have not changed their status .\nit was not possible with our data to test that spillover effect hypothesis . according to rothman and wagner ,\nthe future of primary healthcare largely depends on ability to improve healthcare delivery to meet the needs of chronically ill patients .\nthe chronic care model provides six interrelated components for achieving such change among which is delivery system redesign .\nthis last condition does not seem to have been met in the implementation of new phc models in quebec .\na recent report of the auditor general of quebec to the national assembly casts a critical look at the implantation of fmgs and ncs .\nit explains the relative failure of these phc organizations to fully attain the objectives established by the ministry of health and social services by many factors , notably the absence of clear rules , guidelines , and incentives and , above all , the lack of control of the ministry and the regional agencies on the process of implementation .\nthis means that several new phc practices received complementary funding without respecting all the components of the contractual engagement .\nhowe institute underlines that important factors associated with the slow implementation of fmgs are the low registration rate of patients and the deficient development of teamwork .\nthe findings of our study concur with those of other studies and support concerns expressed by analysts .\nthe use of difference - in - differences ( dd ) method for isolating the specific effect of the reform is fully justified because it provides good internal validity .\nhowever , when carried out in a complex system such as the healthcare system , dd analyses can not completely rule out the possibility of spillover effects .\nfor example , it is possible that some aspects of the healthcare policies spilled over and influenced phc practices of the unexposed control group or that new phc model practices exerted a mimetic influence on the other practices . surveys lend themselves to possible recall bias by respondents .\nconcerning experience of care , unmet needs , and use of services , if present , biases should be equally distributed among respondents .\nrecall biases are less likely to occur when reporting events extending over a certain period of time rather than single events taking place at a given point in time .\nresponses are always limited by respondents ' subjective understanding and their capacity to report accurately medical information .\nthe wording of the questions attenuated this possible effect by referring to validation of the diagnosis by a doctor ( i.e. ,  has a doctor ever told you that you have diabetes ?  ) .\ncategories of chronic diseases were defined and operationalized in the same way in both 2005 and 2010 surveys . however , for the category  other chronic diseases ,  it is possible that our redefinition and classification were more inclusive in 2005 , which may explain the higher percentage of respondents reporting this type of morbidity in 2005 . as pointed out in methods , mental illnesses were not excluded but left in all categories of physical chronic conditions , including the no disease category .\nthe questions concerning mental health problems were slightly different in 2005 and 2010 as well as the time period reference :  have you ever had   in 2005 and  in the last 2 years , did you see your doctor   in 2010 .\nthis may explain the higher percentage of individuals reporting mental health problems in 2005 than in 2010 .\naside from this difference between the two surveys , mental health problems happened to be evenly distributed among our categories of chronic physical diseases , including the no disease category .\nconsequently , we thought that their inclusion would minimize potential biases while increasing statistical power .\nthey are subjective but still most appropriate to use in a patient - centered perspective .\nour questionnaire largely draws from two validated instruments ( pcas and pcat ) [ 2628 ] .\nwe constructed new scales of experience of care , more adapted to our context . following the classical theory of measurement\n, we carried out factor analysis and calculated cronbach 's alpha coefficients which have values close to the commonly accepted level ( 0.70 ) except for accessibility ( 0.30 ) .\nin contrast to the classical reflective approach , in the formative approach items composing an index are not necessarily correlated or substitutable with each other , as is the case in reflective scales [ 30 , 31 ] . as mentioned earlier\n, our scales of experience of care may fail to include processes of care rendered by health professionals other than doctors . in that sense\n, they may underestimate experience of care in contexts of multidisciplinary work and thus fail to fully account for the effect of introducing new types of professionals , as is the case in fmgs and ncs .\nthe possibility of such a bias has been suggested , particularly by researchers using large administrative data banks based on physicians ' reimbursement claims [ 47 , 48 ] .\nthe first fmgs were accredited in march 2003 . since questions related to experience of care and use of services referred to the two years preceding the population surveys , we are confident that the 20032005 time period was a valid baseline in the context of a natural experiment . furthermore ,\nas expected , changes took some time before being fully implemented in phc practices after their accreditation .\nour study 's findings raise questions concerning benefits resulting from the introduction of new phc practice models in qubec .\nthe aim of the phc reform was mainly to improve accessibility and continuity of care for the entire population , but especially for individuals in greater needs such as those with chronic diseases .\nour findings show that , for patients with chronic diseases attached to new phc model practices , continuity increased less than for those attached to other practices .\naccessibility decreased for all users of services but much less for those with no chronic disease in the new model phc practices but did not change for those with chronic diseases .\nthese results raise equity concerns since the ones with more needs seem to have benefitted less from the reform than those less in needs .\nfurthermore , the reform did not reduce the use of the most costly services , er attendance , and hospitalization , nor did it reduce the reporting of unmet needs . based on those findings ,\nit is difficult to conclude that the qubec healthcare reform has been so far successful ."}

onset bilateral ptosis .\nthe 24-year - old female patient complained of double vision and the inability to open both eyes for the past 6 months .\nthe onset of the ptosis had slowly progressed , starting a year prior after the mother noticed her daughter s unequal pupils .\nthe mother reported that her daughter had twitching and gradual closure of her right eye that spread to the left eye within 6 months ( figure 1 ) .\nthe patient s past medical history is significant for premature birth at 28 weeks gestation with corpus callosum agenesis , cerebellar vermis agenesis , a molar tooth -

to - nose test , with the left worse than the right .\na baseline magnetic resonance image of her brain 6 years prior to her first admission due to shunt malfunction revealed dysgenesis of the corpus callosum with colpocephaly , atrophy of the cerebellar vermis , and a large posterior interhemispheric cyst causing anterior displacement of the diencephalon and third ventricle .\nthe brainstem of the patient did not look like the classical  molar tooth sign .\na cystic lesion was located in the right cerebral peduncle , suggesting an entrapped section of the fourth ventricle .\nafter several revisions of both shunts , the frontal shunt tip was placed adjacent to the third ventricle in the region of the right foramen of monro , and the infratentorial shunt tip placed in the cerebral aqueduct .\na computed tomography scan of her head upon admission revealed that the cyst in the right cerebral peduncle had enlarged in size to 11.2 mm . due to her diplopia and bilateral ptosis ,\nmyasthenia gravis was considered . however , the anti - acetylcholine antibody level results and the ice test were within normal limits .\ngenetic testing was carried out in suspicion of dandy walker malformation , but the results revealed a normal female karyotype .\nthe patient was brought to the operating room for bilateral ptosis repair with silicone sling implants .\nseiff slings ( seiff frontalis suspension et , beaver visitec , waltham , ma ) were inserted and tightened until the upper lid was at maximal height whilst still maintaining globe contact . on a follow - up appointment ,\nthe patient was able to open and close her eyes well with frontalis and orbicularis contraction , respectively ( figure 2 ) .\nmany ophthalmic features have been associated with joubert syndrome , such as saccadic dysfunction , primary nystagmus , strabismus , and ptosis.4 however , those features were exclusively described in children , whereas our patient developed bilateral ptosis as a young adult .\nher ptosis and eye movement dysfunction could be a progression of her joubert syndrome , or possibly a complication of multiple ventriculoperitoneal shunting .\nher late - onset ptosis could also be a complication of the fibrocystic changes in her midbrain from multiple ventriculoperitoneal shunting .\nrepeated shunting may also cause further dilatation of the aqueduct , which could disrupt the oculomotor nucleus located anterior to the cerebral aqueduct at the level of the superior colliculi.5 the enlarging midbrain cyst adjacent to the posterior shunt tip could also be the cause of her abnormal ocular motility and bilateral ptosis .\nthe abducens palsy of the left eye could be a sign of increased intracranial pressure from shunt malformation.6 however , we should have been able to identify papilledema in our patient .\nthere have been documented cases of increased intracranial pressure presenting with an isolated abducens palsy without papilledema.7 nystagmus is commonly found in joubert syndrome yet was absent in our patient .\ncongenital ocular fibrosis is characterized by the abnormal insertion and fibrosis of the extraocular muscles with ptosis and compensatory chin elevation , which could account for our patient s ocular findings .\nhowever , the patient s extraocular muscles appeared normal without signs of fibrosis intraoperatively with forced duction testing .\nshe developed bilateral ptosis as an adolescent , and the cause of the ptosis is still unclear .\nwe present a rare case of central third nuclear ptosis secondary to joubert syndrome or perhaps its management of cerebrospinal fluid flow blockage .\nto our knowledge , this is the first such case of adult -

assessed health instruments specific to the knee in the 31 studies that were included . also , wang et al .\nidentified twenty - four unique instrument outcomes measurements for the knee . regarding functional performance tests\nthe review done by clark reported that more than 18 tests were used to evaluate the function of lower extremity following an acl deficiency or acl reconstruction . in light of the abundance of tests available\n, there appears no consensus regarding which test or combination of tests is most appropriate for evaluating recovery following acl reconstruction .\nit has been recommended that a multiplicity of assessments , incorporating both functional performance testing and patient reported tools , is important to evaluate functional ability and outcome for patients following acl reconstruction , but which of these tests or combination of tests provides the most rigorous test for outcome remains unclear . as no single instrument or functional performance test is currently capable of measuring all the multitude of parameters believed to relate to outcome , it is rational to accept that a range of tests should be administered to facilitate a full comprehensive evaluation of outcome .\nfunctional performance testing is likely to indicate the outcome of the neuromuscular training and appears to consist of two components .\nthe first component is the quantity of movement or the capabilities of the production of the force , for example , muscle strength measurements and hop tests .\nthe second component is the quality of movement , for example , the total knee flexion when landing from a jump or the occurrence of dynamic knee valgus [ 9 , 10 ] .\nthese two components are important in rehabilitation and prevention of acl recurrent injuries or surgery failure [ 8 , 11 , 12 ] .\nmost papers describing the functional performance following acl reconstruction are using the limb symmetry index ( lsi ) and thus are limited to quantitative measurements [ 13 , 14 ] .\nfunctional performance testing using qualitative methods evaluates compensation , or asymmetry , through clinical observation . the limb symmetry index ( lsi )\nthe lsi is the percentage deficit of the distance hopped on the involved leg compared with the contralateral noninvolved leg .\nthe use of the lsi minimizes the probable confounding variable of the biological variation between people , which may affects the results .\nthe work of munro and herrington   showed lsi needs to be in excess of 90% to be deemed normal .\na functional outcome is a predicted result of care that is meaningful and practical for the patients and sustainable beyond the rehabilitation environment .\nthere are advantages and limitations to each measure used independently or in conjunction with other measures .\nthe practicality of functional outcome measures employed in the clinical / research setting is an important consideration .\nfunctional or performance tests provide an objective assessment of components of the patients ' ability in a structured , controlled setting .\ncombining several tests to assess function may serve to minimize any trade - offs between specificity and sensitivity . regardless of which tests\nare selected , it is imperative that they be standardised , reliable , valid , and responsive to change with time as well as being clinically relevant [ 2022 ]\n. ideally , outcome measures in research and clinical practice should be low - cost , take an acceptable length of time to administer , be convenient for researcher and clinicians to use , and be acceptable to the participants under investigation [ 21 , 22 ] .\ntherefore , the purpose of this scoping review was to identify and explore a number of commonly used outcome measures for patients following acl reconstruction and postoperative rehabilitation to assess both aspects ( quantitative and qualitative ) of functional performance tests and self - reported questionnaires that have been used in last decade .\n\n we adopted a  systematic  scoping review approach  this is a combination of a scoping review methodology  to ensure the inclusion of broad areas of research and study designs and a systematic review of the methodology of the reviews .\na scoping review is a relatively new type of study providing an assessment of available evidence from the literature in a broad area of research such as the compliance in the reporting of clinical studies to established guidelines .\nit also serves to identify information gaps in the field and provide recommendations for implementation .\nthe methodology of scoping reviews was first described in detail by arksey and o'malley   in their pivotal paper published in 2005 , which provided the foundation for carrying out a scoping review .\nthis framework was further refined , and five stages were proposed to be followed when conducting a scoping review , including ( 1 ) the identification of a research question ; ( 2 ) finding the relevant studies ; ( 3 ) the selection of studies to be included in the review ; ( 4 ) data extraction from the included studies ; and ( 5 ) assembling , summarizing , and reporting the results of the review . a prisma compliant search strategy was used for study selection .\nthe inclusion criteria of studies were as follows : ( 1 ) at least one lower extremity / knee functional performance test used as an outcome measurement of the article and/or patient reported outcomes , ( 2 ) subjects who were post - acl reconstruction , ( 3 ) studies which were either randomised control trial ( rct ) , cross - sectional , or cohort designs , and ( 4 ) studies published in english between april 2004 and april 2014 .\nthe electronic databases used were medline ( mesh terms ) , pubmed , cochrane library ( systematic reviews and controlled trials registers ) , embase , cinahl , sportdiscus , pedro ( physiotherapy evidence database ) , and amed ( allied and complementary medicine index ) . in order to capture as many relevant references as possible ,\nan expanded search was performed , including hand - searching the reference lists of all relevant articles , texts , and systematic reviews .\nsearch was conducted using the terms  knee  and  acl injuries  or  functional performance  and  measure  or \ntest  or  screen  or  assessment  or  patient reported . \nthe keyword search was also performed on pubmed utilising the key terms  anterior cruciate ligament  and  surgery  and  injury  and  physical performance outcome measurements  to ensure a detailed and comprehensive search strategy , and the additional search was performed in academic textbook that contained an extensive review of functional performance tests   ( see table 1 ) .\ntwo reviewers ( adel almangoush and lee herrington ) independently reviewed all titles and abstracts that were identified from the search strategy . in accordance with the predefined eligibility criteria the full - text manuscripts for all potentially eligible studies were obtained , and then in accordance with the predefined eligibility criteria the reviewers independently reviewed them a second time .\ndata extraction for each eligible paper was performed independently by two reviewers ( adel almangoush and lee herrington ) using a predefined spreadsheet .\nthe standardised data extraction form included details on ( a ) focus of study , study design , participant details , outcome measure ( functional performance tests and patient reported outcomes ) , and results . in cases where\ninsufficient data were provided within the publication , attempts were made to contact all corresponding authors to identify such data .\neach study 's methodological quality was assessed by using an appraisal tool devised to specifically evaluate functional performance testing and patients ' reported questionnaires of studies that included those patients following acl reconstruction .\nthis was based on the critical appraisal skills programme ( casp ) critical appraisal tool ( casp , 2007 ) , which has been widely used and employed in previous systematic reviews to evaluate the methodological quality of clinical studies [ 4345 ] .\nthe tool assessed domains such as the identification of the research questions , appropriateness of the research design , surgery and rehabilitation outcomes , the accuracy of description of methodology and population , appropriateness of analysis methods , and interpretation of findings .\nthe appraisal was independently undertaken by two aforementioned reviewers ( adel almangoush and lee herrington ) .\nif any disagreements arose regarding the study selection , data extraction , or appraisal score , these were sorted out through discussion between the two reviewers until a consensus was met .\nstudies were excluded if they achieved a very low methodological score of less than 50% through the casp scoring system .\nall analyses were initially undertaken by one reviewer ( adel almangoush ) and verified by the other reviewer ( lee herrington ) .\nan assessment of the quantity and quality of functional performance testing and patient reported tools of those patients following acl reconstruction by means of a meta - analysis was planned .\nhowever , unfortunately due to the heterogeneity of the studies , in particular the information regarding surgery and rehabilitation outcomes , it was not possible to complete this analysis .\na prisma compliant search strategy was used , and results are presented in a prisma flow diagram ( figure 1 ) . as figure 1 demonstrates ,\neleven studies assessed knee laxity using a variety of instrumented laxity tests . nine studies used a kt-1000 arthrometer ( medmetric , san diego , ca , usa ) [ 26 , 27 , 29 , 31 , 3337 ] .\none study used a manual maximum test with a rolimeter ( aircast , summit , nj , usa ) .\nall studies assessed the anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur , except one study which used medial joint space opening on manual valgus stress testing .\nonly six papers ( 38% ) justified their sample sizes based on power calculations . whilst the surgery management strategies undertaken were clearly described in most of these papers , only four publications presented sufficient information to reproduce their methodologies for physiotherapy treatments and described the rehabilitation programs undertaken ( 25% ) .\nfurthermore , whilst all studies reviewed used appropriate outcome measures to evaluate their participants , only a few of them defined the presence of an observer . whilst inferential statistics were presented in all included publications , confidence intervals\nhowever , all authors interpreted their findings appropriately and related these results in a suitable manner to clinical practice and the existing evidence base .\noutcome measures . a variety of different functional performance tests and patient reported outcomes measures have been reported in patients following acl reconstruction .\na number of different assessment methods were used to determine the functional performance of patients following acl reconstruction .\nthese methods included the one - leg hope for distance ; this is a commonly used functional performance test of both strength and confidence in the tested leg ; it correlates positively with muscle strength and power [ 7 , 47 ] .\nthe one - leg hope for distance was assessed in fourteen studies ( 88% ) of the papers included .\ntriple hop test for distance was evaluated in four papers [ 31 , 32 , 34 , 37 ] .\nthree studies described a 6-meter timed hop test for speed [ 31 , 32 , 34 ] ; crossover hop of distance was assessed in two studies [ 31 , 34 ] ; side hop and vertical jump were also assessed in two studies [ 21 , 38 ] ; triple - jump test and stair hop test were evaluated in one study only ; and functional squat test was assessed in only one study also .\nmore than 50% of studies used the hop tests as a measurement of function within the battery of different tests completed .\nonly seven studies used multiple hop tests ( 44% ) , and only seven papers ( less than 50% ) reported limb symmetry index ( lsi ) comparing the injured with uninjured leg .\nonly one study described the quality of movement whilst carrying out the test ( e.g. , dynamic knee valgus or knee flexion angle ) .\npostural stability of patients following acl reconstruction was assessed in four studies by using different measurement methods .\nused the modified star excursion balance test ( sebt ) to evaluate the postural control of their patients [ 24 , 28 ] .\nbalance was recorded using static and dynamic balance tests on an instrumented unstable platform ( kat2000 ) .\nseveral reported questionnaires presented in the papers were evaluated in this scoping review , whereas koos and ikdc were assessed in most of the selected papers .\nonly four studies used lysholm score [ 29 , 32 , 33 , 36 ] , three papers assessed the tegner activity level rating scale [ 23 , 27 , 32 ] , and only two studies per each score evaluated the global rating scale [ 31 , 34 ] , the kos - adls questionnaire [ 31 , 34 ] , and the cincinnati knee score [ 35 , 37 ] .\nthey concluded that subjective variables are more important for evaluation of patient reported outcomes than objective findings .\nthey found 7  key  symptoms that together accounted for 83% of the variability in patients reported outcomes .\nthe authors of the current review aimed to identify existing functional performance testing and patient reported outcomes for patients following acl reconstruction in the last decade .\nthe most important finding of the present study was that all included articles used limited quantitative measurements to determine functional performance , except the study done by trulsson et al . .\nin the last decade most of the studies included in this review were focusing on the hop tests especially the single - leg hop test and few of these studies looked at a postural stability . regarding the reported outcomes the focus was on the koos and ikdc questionnaires .\nalthough the included articles reported the use of several hop tests , fourteen studies used a single - leg hop for distance as the gold standard for measuring functional performance after acl reconstruction because the reliability of this test is high ( icc ranging from 0.86 to 0.95 ) [ 49 , 50 ] .\nthe relative reliability of the single hop for distance test in patients 1 to 2 years following acl reconstruction has previously been reported .\nhowever , several studies showed that the sensitivity increases when two or more different hop tests are performed [ 5052 ] . by using multiple hop tests ,\ntheir qualities can be assessed and thereby the opportunity to detect discrepancies in hop performance increases .\nthere is a strong relationship between crossover hop performance and functional outcome   correlating significantly to ikdc subjective and koos questionnaire scores .\nthe most reliable and valid of the multitude of hop tests in relation to the aclr patient would appear to be the single hop for distance and the crossover hop tests [ 7 , 50 , 54 ] .\nthe ability of the aclr patient to perform well during hop tests is of paramount importance when judging functional performance .\nhop testing has frequently been proposed as a practical performance - based outcome measure that reflects the integrated effect of neuromuscular control , strength ( force - generating capacity ) , and confidence in the limb and requires minimal equipment and time to administer .\nbased on a review of the potential use of hop tests as measures of dynamic knee stability , fitzgerald et al .   suggested that hopping may be appropriate for use as a predictive tool for identifying patients who may have future problems as a result of knee injury or pathology and as an evaluative tool to reflect change in the patient status in response to treatment . within the published literature , the  gold standard \nis often regarded as having a limb symmetry index ( lsi ) of greater than 85% , indicating that anything less than a 15% deficit in strength between the operated and nonoperated limb is acceptable .\na study conducted in   has shown that the contralateral ( noninjured ) leg is significantly weaker than matched controls .\ntherefore , this assumption of normality should be viewed with caution , as the period of time during both preoperative and postoperative rehabilitation is likely to have caused atrophy of the noninjured leg .\nhowever , using the lsi is debatable because recent studies have shown that an acl injury could lead to a crossover effect in the uninvolved leg resulting in strength and function loss based on biomechanical and neuromuscular changes . to the best of the knowledge of this study 's researchers , there are few published studies that search for postural stability following acl reconstruction .\nfor example , the sebt outcome measure offers a simple , reliable , valid , and low - cost alternative to more sophisticated instrumented methods , to assess dynamic balance ability [ 59 , 60 ] ; unlike force plates or electronically controlled balance platforms , it is an easy and highly portable test that could be employed in a range of clinical environments . according to logerstedt et al .  \nthe grid required testing for acl deficiency patients , three lines are positioned on the grid ( anterior , medial , and lateral reach distance ) which are labelled according to the direction of excursion relative to the stance leg .\nhigh intertester reliability of the sebt has previously been reported . whilst previous studies have evaluated intratester reliability ,\nonly one study has evaluated between - session reliability of the sebt with normalised scores with icc values ranging from 0.89 to 0.93 . however , only 3 reach distances , anterior , posteromedial , and posterolateral , were evaluated .\ntherefore , further study of between - session reliability of all reach directions is warranted .\nprevious research has suggested that the sebt is reliable and sensitive enough to detect dynamic postural control deficits in patients with an acl - deficient ( acl - d ) limb [ 62 , 63 ] . in these studies ,\npatients who were injured were shown to have lower sebt scores compared to those of their uninjured limb and those of healthy participants .\nin particular , herrington et al .   found that patients with acl deficiency showed functional deficits in the anterior , medial , lateral , and posteromedial reach directions .\nfunctional tests are a quick and inexpensive method of obtaining an objective measure of lower limb function following surgery .\nthese tests are thought to provide an indication of muscle strength and power , neuromuscular control and confidence [ 64 , 65 ] .\nadditionally , a number of authors have highlighted that a single functional test may not be sensitive enough to detect performance limitations and that at least two functional tests should be used [ 51 , 52 , 55 ] .\nonly one study described the quality of movement whilst carrying out the test ( e.g. , dynamic knee valgus or knee flexion angle ) .\nstudies focusing on prevention showed that the risk for acl injuries was reduced when training was done before high quality trials [ 6668 ] .\nfor acl injury screening , ekegren and his colleagues examined dynamic knee valgus during a drop - jump task .\nthe drop jump turned out to be a reliable and valid instrument in observing the dynamic knee valgus .\ninvestigated videotaped functional performance tests in acl injured subjects , and they reported that observation is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing knee flexion angles of the one - leg hop for a distance .\nthe single - leg squat ( sls ) test is a cost - effective and simple movement to determine lower extremity alignment in the coronal plane . carried out with a single camera in any setting ,\nthis procedure can visibly identify a valgus lower extremity alignment on landing , which is considered to be a potential risk factor for a possible noncontact acl injury .\nthe sls test has been described in a number of studies as a useful clinical measure to identify hip muscle function and dynamic knee control .\npatient reported instruments are normally related to signs and symptoms experienced by the patient and/or the functional tasks that individuals are able to achieve during their activities of daily living .\na commonly used knee outcome instrument is the cincinnati knee scoring scale , and although it has been demonstrated to be an adequate tool to evaluate knee function following acl reconstruction , it also includes manual and instrumented stability testing to assess symptoms and function ; thus it becomes more difficult to separate various aspects of knee function following acl injury .\nthe international knee documentation committee ( ikdc ) developed a scoring system for knees with acl injuries .\nthe ikdc , the cincinnati knee scoring scale , and the first version of the lysholm score are assessor reported scores , which have been exposed to be biased when applied to individuals with an acl injury . on the other hand ,\ncarlos argued that for those clinicians and researchers considering using only the ikdc as their patient reported outcomes for acl reconstruction , they should include as a minimum the koos subscales that address broader areas of concern , including quality of life and emotional health that are most important to patients following acl reconstruction and are not wholly represented in ikdc .\nmoreover , there is a suggestion that the koos is perhaps more suitable for the assessment of patients in the longer term unlike the ikdc .\nthe koos has shown good validity and demonstrated that it is responsive to acl reconstruction and rehabilitation ; it shows that it is a reliable instrument for patients undergoing acl surgery and rehabilitation .\nkoos has been used in an extensive amount of current research protocols and it has been translated and culturally adapted into various languages .\nclinicians and researchers looking to use a patient - based score measure of outcomes must consider the specific patient population in which it has been evaluated .\nusing a diagnostic algorithm that measures the anatomic parts of the knee as separate constructs may solve this dilemma , allowing for the measurement of treatment outcomes across patient groups and the selection of the optimal clinical intervention .\nin general , the papers in this literature review included poorly described sample sizes and whether or not the sample size was based on power calculations .\naccordingly , the samples recruited may not necessarily have been big enough to identify a difference in outcome following a rehabilitation programme , irrespective of whether or not a difference existed .\naccordingly , it was not possible to determine whether measurement error influenced the results obtained or whether the experiences or training of the assessors was a variable which may have accounted for any between - study differences . \n limitations .\nfor instance , the authors established very specific inclusion / exclusion criteria for selection of functional performance tests included inthis review .\nmany tests were excluded because the studies were performed on healthy people or subjects with various neurological or debilitating comorbidities .\nthis may modify the interpretation of the values attained for a specific functional performance test , and this was also the reason for the small number of studies included .\nfuture studies are required to establish the reliability and validity of existing functional performance tests or explore new , relevant quality measurements of the functional performance tests to be used in patients following acl surgery .\nthis review shows that , following the acl reconstruction , the one - leg hop for distance or a combination of different hops and the limb symmetry index ( lsi ) of functional performance tests was used as a main outcome parameter of several studies .\nno extensive research has been carried out over the past 10 years to measure the control stability of patients following acl reconstruction .\nfurthermore , no observation or videotaping was used to assess the quality of any test of any functional performance and control stability of acl patients following surgery except for one study . because previous studies discuss additional important parameters , a more extensive battery of tests\nis suggested to measure both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of functional performance after the acl reconstruction .\nthe koos and the ikdc are both measures that are increasingly being used for acl reconstruction during the last 10 years ."}
{"id": 72, "text": "breslau and associates estimated the lifetime prevalence of physical assault in the united states to be 8.3% for both genders .\nother studies have reported lifetime rates of physical assault from 7% to 12% for women and from 10% to 19% in males.[25 ] although the risk for assault exists in all ethnic , racial , and socioeconomic classes , certain demographic groups experience disproportionate rates of physical violence .\nseveral studies show racial disparities exist among victims of assault.[246 ] amstadter and associates showed african americans were two - fold as likely to have experienced a new physical assault compared to their caucasian counterparts .\nother studies have confirmed the finding that african americans are at the greatest risk of violence . in his assessment of lifetime rates of violence among men and women ,\nkilpatrick et al . found 28% of african americans reported that they had been assault victims , compared with 19% of caucasians .\nlow income is also reported as a predictive factor for assault . a study of income and risk of assault by kessler et al .\n, found persons of both sexes with annual household incomes below $ 15,000 are one and a half times more likely to be physically assaulted as persons with annual household incomes above $ 15,000 .\nthe inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and susceptibility to assault was confirmed again in a study in milwaukee , wisconsin study adolescent assault victims which found subjects with lower median household incomes experienced higher rates of interpersonal violence .\nthe costs of nonfatal physical assault are significant and entail more than simply the physical injury sustained by the victim .\nvictims of violent assault also experience psychological injury , lost productivity from missed work and school days , and loss of quality of life due to pain and suffering .\nlifetime costs for intentional injury for patients twelve and older were estimated at $ 187 billion during the period from 1987 - 1990 , with $ 96 billion dollars attributed to injury from assault .\nthe estimate $ 96 billion dollar cost associated with injury from assault included approximately $ 8 billion dollars for medical costs , $ 53 billion for mental health care costs and $ 35 billion for lost quality of life .\nthis breaks down to a per physical injury cost for assault victims of $ 22,000 .\nalthough racial and socioeconomic disparities and the costs of these disparities to assault victims is well documented , the predictive factors that lead to these disparities in female assault victims remains an open area of research .\nthe interplay between the identified predictors of assault and their combined contribution to violent victimization in women is better elucidated .\nexisting literature fails to show the influence that one predictor of assault has on the co - existence of other predictors of assault .\nthis interplay suggests that even though individual risk factors may increase the likelihood of assault , the combination of multiple risk factors , creates a susceptible patient population that is significantly more likely to experience assault .\nthe identification of this interaction between two different risk factors could be useful to select a population more susceptible to the risk for assault and trauma than any other individual risk factor alone would be able to predict . selecting for a susceptible population would allow public health efforts to be focused appropriately on the highest risk population .\nadditionally , existing literature largely draws conclusions from all emergency room visits and fails to specifically analyze \" severe assaults , \" or assaults serious enough in nature to necessitate trauma activation .\nthe purpose of this study is to determine predictors of assault and predictors of high - risk behaviors in women who sustain injuries significant enough to require state of illinois trauma activation . identifying the predictive factors that make women a susceptible population to assault requiring trauma activation will help inform injury prevention efforts and ideally lead to a reduction in violent victimization among women .\nto identify both predictors of severe assault and the high - risk behaviors of severely assaulted women , a retrospective analysis of all female trauma patients was performed using the illinois department of public health trauma registry .\nthe registry is a state - wide , mandatory reporting system that contains de - identified information for all trauma patients from all trauma centers in illinois .\npermission to use the database was obtained from the illinois department of public health and this study was approved by the university institutional review board . for the period 1999 - 2003 , all female trauma patients aged 15 - 50 were identified . the following e - codes for assault were used to identify the female victims : 960 ( 0.0 - 0.1 ) , 961 , 962 ( 0.0 - 0.9 ) , 963 - 964 , 965 ( 0.0 - 0.9 ) , 966 , 967 ( 0.0 - 0.9 ) , 968 ( 0.0 - 0.9 ) and victims of gunshot and stabbing wounds were included in this group . the remaining women ( n = 23,841 ) who had other , non - assault mechanisms of injury served as the control group .\ndemographic data was collected on both the study and control groups to include age , race , pregnancy status , alcohol and drug use , insurance status , residence in a rural area [ table 1 ] .\ndrug use was based on the presence of one or more of the following seven substances : amphetamine , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , cocaine , marijuana , opiates , and phencyclidine .\npatients were considered uninsured if they had medicaid or were listed as having no insurance .\nmedicaid patients were considered uninsured because many of these patients entered the hospital without insurance and were enrolled in medicaid only during their hospital stay .\nchicago , springfield , and east saint louis are considered urban ; all other areas fall under the rural category . demographic characteristics and predictors of assault in female trauma victims by mechanism of injury data\na logistic regression model was used to compare the two groups of female victims ( those who were assaulted against those who had other mechanisms of injury ) on variables including age , race , pregnancy status , alcohol and drug use , rural residence and lack of insurance , in order to identify factors predictive of assault and high - risk behaviors .\nonce factors predictive of assault were identified , a separate analysis was conducted to study interaction affects among these identified risk factors .\nthis additional analysis examined the combined effect of the identified predictors of assault on end outcome- all possible variations of combined risk factors were studied .\nin a retrospective review of all trauma patients from all trauma centers in the state of illinois for the time period 1999 - 2003 , 26,602 female victims were identified . of these 26,602 female victims , 2,761 ( 10.4% )\nreported assault as their mechanism of injury , and the remaining 23,841 women had other listed mechanisms of injury . in comparing the two groups ,\nthe age distribution in the assaulted women group was younger than in the other mechanism of injury group .\nabout 53.4% of the assaulted women group was in the ages 15 - 30 , while in the other mechanism of injury group , only 48.1% fell in this age range . in regards to race\n, 75.6% of assaults were against non - white women , in contrast to the female victims of non - assaultive traumas , of whom only 35.6% were non - white .\nthis disparity was largely due to the significant percentage ( 64.3% ) of assaulted women who were of african american descent .\nother races did not factor significantly in the racial disparity between the assaulted and other mechanism of injury groups , largely due to small total numbers in the study population . in addition to being non - white , women who were assaulted were also more likely to use alcohol ( 54.7% versus 39.6% ) and drugs ( 25.0% versus 16.2% , p\n< 0.001 ) than women in the other mechanisms of injury group [ table 1 ] .\nafter comparing demographic differences between female trauma victims who were assaulted and female trauma victims who reported other mechanisms of injury , attention turned to identifying specific predictors of assault among the female assault victims .\non multivariate regression analysis , three variables were noted to be independent predictors of assault in the female victims including african american race ( or 3.88 , p < 0.001 ) , lack of insurance ( or 1.79 , p < 0.001 ) , and drug use ( or 1.32 , p < 0.001 ) [ table 2 ] .\nage under 30 also predicted assault ( or = 1.17 , p < 0.001 ) .\nneither pregnancy nor rural residence appeared to play a role in female victims likelihood of being assaulted .\npredictors of assault in women in this data set , female victims with one identified predictor of assault often exhibited other predictive factors for assault .\nmultivariate analysis to predict the likelihood of certain risk factors among female assault victims was undertaken . in table 3\nthe data shows assaulted women who use alcohol are also significantly more likely to be uninsured ( or 3.5 , p < 0.001 ) and also more likely to use drugs ( or = 1.7 , p < 0.001 ) .\npredictors of alcohol use in female assault victims these findings were confirmed again when predictors of drug use and uninsured status were analyzed individually .\nfemale assault victims who used drugs were also more likely to be uninsured ( or = 1.8 , p < 0.001 ) and to use alcohol ( or = 1.7 , p < 0.001 ) .\nafrican - american race also appeared to be more prevalent among female assault victims who used drugs ( or = 1.5 , p = 0.009 ) .\nin contrast , neither latina race nor age appeared statistically significant predictors of drug use in female assault victims [ table 4 ] .\npredictors of drug use in female assault victims predictors of uninsured status in female assault victims included african american race ( or 4.6 , p < 0.001 ) , alcohol use ( or 3.3 , p < 0.001 ) and drug use ( or 1.7 , p < 0.001 ) .\nadditionally , latina race was also a statistically significant predictor of being uninsured for female trauma patients who reported assault as their mechanism of injury [ table 5 ] . predictors of uninsured status in female assault victims clearly , female assault victims often exhibit more than one high - risk behavior or risk factor for assault .\nthese risk factors may not just exist in tandem but may also interact to exert a shared and therefore increased influence on the overall susceptibility of female victims to assault . the combined influence , or interaction\naffects , of these risk factors on violent victimization was tested in a regression analysis [ table 6 ] .\nthe regression model showed that drug use and being uninsured had a combined effect of predicting assault ( or 1.67 , p < 0.02 ) .\ncharacteristics of female assault victims and predictors of physical assault in female trauma patients were examined in this study .\nthe study showed women of african - american race , women without insurance , and women who used alcohol and/or drugs are disproportionately represented among assault victims .\na significant finding of this study was that female assault victims with one predictor of assault were more likely to have multiple predictors of assault and when drug use is combined with lack of insurance the likelihood of being assaulted increases . while there are known disparities in trauma , this paper highlights the interaction between these risk factors , which has not previously been studied in this patient population .\nlack of insurance and drug abuse are more frequent among people with low socioeconomic status , however , having both of these factors increase the risk more that each individual factor would predict . therefore\n, this susceptible population bears more of the risk for assault and trauma than any individual risk factor would predict .\nthis underscores the observation that there are racial and socioeconomic disparities with respect to violent victimization , and makes an argument for specific interventions to this high risk population .\nthis study demonstrates that predictors of assault in women frequently coexist and both independently and in combination may increase risk .\none possibility is that one of the predictors of assault identified in this study , for example , lack of insurance , is the unifying link that increases the likelihood of a victim exhibiting all other predictors of assault .\nanother possibility is that an unnamed risk factor such as poverty or education level is the link that explains the co - existence of all of these high - risk taking behaviors in one setting .\nthere is also the possibility that the temporal order between victimization and the identified predictors of assault is inverse to what is interpreted in this paper .\nthat is , instead of drug use and lack of insurance being factors predicting the likelihood of women to experience assault , females may be more likely to use drugs and alcohol and not have insurance precisely because they have been assaulted .\nthe significance of the co - existence of multiple predictors of assaults in female victims is relevant both to the understanding of what leads to gender - based violent victimization and how healthcare providers and society can most effectively intervene .\nhowever , this study is not without limitations , including defining a rural / urban dichotomy on the basis of population , without considering boundaries or suburbs , and possible lack of generalizability as this study is restricted to urban patients from a single state in the u.s .\nit also would have been beneficial to have data on a wider range of predictors of assault including socioeconomic status , education level , u.s .\ndespite its limitations , this is a powerful study that demonstrates the interdependence of risk factors for assault in a population - based sample of women in a large midwestern state .\nthis study helps us gain an understanding of how predictors of assault in female victims interact and lead to an increase susceptibility to violent victimization .\nalthough there is no acceptable justification for violence against women , understanding the factors that predict assault in women can serve as a way to increase awareness of the victimization of women and to help better direct intervention and prevention efforts , especially in areas such as multimodality drug or treatment programs or comprehensive domestic violence shelters offering drug and alcohol services .\nfuture research should also be directed at identifying protective factors against female violent victimization , which remains a yet unexplored area of study ."}

however , about 3040% of patients do not respond to this treatment .\nin addition , performing bivp can be challenging with a long procedural time and might even be impossible due to the coronary sinus anatomy .\nrehwinkel et al . demonstrated that upgrading to hbp could be an effective alternative to bivp for picm with preserved his - purkinje conduction . because our patients native rhythm remained 2:1 av block with a narrow qrs\n, we attempted hbp as the first - line treatment based on the assumption that his - purkinje conduction might be preserved .\nanother benefit of hbp in this patient with ckd is that the use of iodinated contrast media could be avoided .\nhbp using a deflectable lead delivery system was easily achieved with a fluoroscopic time of 8 minutes .\nlustgarten et al . reported that hb pacing lead placement with this system was no more difficult and took less time to implant than placement of a lv lead .\nour patient is thought to be a super - responder to crt by hbp although the form of hbp was nonselective\n. however , there seems to be no significant clinical difference between selective hbp ( his - only capture ) and nonselective hbp because both forms do not alter physiological impulse conduction and possibly maintain rapid and synchronous lv activation .\nindeed , catanzariti et al . reported that no difference was observed between the two forms of hbp at acute measures of dyssynchrony .\nmost patients with picm having a native narrow qrs have preserved his - purkinje conduction , and therefore upgrading to hbp would be expected to restore physiological synchronous lv activation .\nrecently , vijayaraman et al . demonstrated that his - purkinje conduction could be normalized by permanent hbp in 76% of patients with infranodal av block and a wide qrs complex , indicating intra - his block .\nthis finding suggests that many patients with picm having a native wide qrs might have preserved distal his - purkinje conduction , and permanent hbp at the distal hb ( distal to the site of the block / delay ) could restore physiological synchronous lv activation .\nthe hb pacing threshold remained excellent in our patient at the 6-month follow - up ; however , long - term follow - up is necessary .\ntheoretically , hbp is a more physiological treatment than bivp in patients with picm having preserved his - purkinje conduction .\nfurther studies are needed to evaluate the long - term safety and efficacy of permanent hbp in patients with picm . in conclusion\nthis case shows that permanent hbp can be an effective alternative to bivp with significant improvements in heart failure symptoms and lvef ."}

isoleucine covalently bound to the cofactor pyridoxamine phosphate \n ( pmp ) , bound form of the enzyme ( pdb code : 1kt8 ) , and the pmp bound form ( pdb code : 1kta ) .\nboth were downloaded from www.pdb.org and prepared \n using the visual molecular dynamics ( vmd ) software .\nas 1kt8 is missing residues near the mutation site , it was used as a reference \n structure onto which the coordinates of 1kta were superimposed in order to include \n the coordinates of residues 175 to 191 .\nresidue 186 ( please , \n note that our residue numbering scheme in this paper follows the recommendations \n of human genome variation society and thus may differ by six from \n other authors ) was then mutated from threonine to arginine , and hydrogens \n were added .\nthe resulting coordinates were stored and from them \n an additional starting structure was generated in which the arg186 \n backbone  dihedral was rotated from + 132 to 60 \n by rotating parts of both arg186 and pro187 , while  was held \n constant at 80 . after rotation , residues 185188 were \n minimized with the remainder of the protein fixed .\nboth these final \n coordinates and the original unrotated structure were then minimized , \n holding all atoms of the protein fixed except for those in residues \n 175191 .\nthe final coordinates of each were stored and used \n as the basis for side chain rotamer generation . for \n both\nthe original and rotated  backbone structures , \n the side chain angles 1 and 2 of \n arg186 were subsequently rotated in six increments of 60 , yielding \n a total of 72 structures . from the original structure ,\nthe side chain \n was rotated about the 1 bond without altering the \n original 2 torsion , generating an additional six \n structures .\ntwo independent minimizations were performed on \n each of the 78 structures : one in which the entire system was minimized , \n and one in which only residues 177188 were minimized while \n all else was held fixed .\nthe final coordinates of each minimization \n were used for electrostatic free energy calculations and structure \n analysis .\nelectrostatic free energy calculations were conducted on the first \n monomer ( chain a ) of each of the 156 bcat2 structures .\nthe pdb 2pqr software was used to generate pqr files for each structure . \n here\n, the charmm27 parameter set was used to obtain partial atomic \n charges and atomic radii , and a ph of 7.0 was used in assigning protonation \n states for titratable residues .\nthe total electrostatic free energy \n of the system was calculated using the apbs software package .\nthe structures of each minimization set were \n ranked by their corresponding energies and the best ten structures \n of both sets were analyzed using vmd .\nwe addressed the determination of mutant proteoforms \n in biological samples , a high priority within the c - hpp . a novel systematic \n approach\nwas developed that is based on searching shotgun proteome \n tandem spectra , collected via data dependent analysis , against a customized \n protein sequence database containing chromosome 19 savs .\nthe new database \n used for identification of mutant proteoforms was compiled with all \n human consensus proteins together with a new set of missense snv - derived \n sequences of chromosome 19 . to improve search quality , the frequently \n used crap contaminant protein database was also included , resulting \n in a database of 172  927 protein sequences in total . when search space is confined to short sequences derived from only \n one chromosome , a problem\nis expected that is similar to one observed \n when a search is performed against a database for a partially sequenced \n organism . in a standard target - decoy approach , a number of high quality \n spectra will be wrongly matched to decoy sequences simply due to the \n absence of correct peptide sequences in the target database .\nthis \n makes adequate significance estimation , often represented in proteomics \n as global false discovery rate , rather challenging .\nbecause many proteins \n exist in multiple isoforms , for example , structural proteins such \n as myosin or tubulin , there is a high risk that a spectrum may be \n also erroneously assigned to a sav - containing peptide .\nthose issues \n can be addressed by creating a custom decoy database , a task that is not trivial in the case of short , low complexity \n sequences .\nalternatively , protein sequences from the other homologous \n species , or in our case the rest of the canonical proteome from the \n same species , could be appended to a database of interest , adding \n more possibilities for the correct peptide - spectrum matches in a target \n data set and , therefore , enabling target - decoy approach implemented \n by standard search engines .\nbecause \n protein databases for shotgun proteomic searches do not \n commonly include sav sequences , and different search engines may perform \n differently with the same database ; three search engines ( sequest , \n peaks , and mascot ) were employed and the corresponding search results \n were compared .\ntriplicate data files for each cell line were used \n as a single input for database searching , initially performed with \n nearly identical search parameters .\nan initial search and validation \n on a subset of the gscs revealed \n several savs .\nmanual verification of spectra containing savs led to \n confirmation of a t186r substitution of branched - chain aminotransferase \n 2 ( bcat2 ) ( see figure 1 ) , a known natural variant \n of the protein , in gsc28 .\nthis finding was further \n validated at the transcript level and by srm ( see sections 3.2 and 3.3 , respectively ) .\nhcd -

containing peptide of bcat2 ( pvlignepslgvsqpr ) in gsc 28 was used as a positive control \n for all database searches .\naccording to the snap database of gpmdb , \n this tryptic peptide of bcat2 is less frequently observed compared \n with its longer , miscleaved forms ( http://snap.thegpm.org/%7e/dblist_protein_mut/label=ensp00000322991 ) .\nhowever , this may be a biased result of search algorithms that \n consider such peptides as false .\ninterestingly , \n peaks db was the only search engine that successfully identified the \n peptide containing bcat2 p.thr186arg , with a 10log p score of 74 .\nneither sequest nor mascot identified this \n peptide , despite the high confidence of the assignment in peaks .\nour \n initial thought was that both failed to identify the peptide due to \n trypsin cleavage specificity assigned in the search parameters , as \n the n - terminus of the sav - containing peptide arises from cleavage \n between arginine and proline .\ntherefore , we adjusted the trypsin specificity \n in mascot to allow for cleavage n - terminal to proline and repeated \n the search using gsc 28 as a positive control . because mascot again \n failed to identify the peptide containing bcat2 p.thr186arg , we focused on peaks db to identify savs in the remaining cell lines \n ( see table 1 for a verified list and supporting information table 1 for a complete \n list of sav peptides identified by peaks ) . annotated hcd \nms / ms spectra \n and the corresponding ion tables can be found in supporting information figure 1 .\nconflict in dbsnp and ensembl databases , \n which indicates this mutation q  h. for those peptides that were confirmed to be truly \n unique by homology \n searching , manual verification of spectra was performed in order to \n ensure that the assigned savs were correct . because our data were \n acquired using high resolution ms in an orbitrap , mass error for the \n precursor ions was used as an initial filter of quality . because the \n mass errors for peptide assignments in each lc  ms / ms file fall \n into a normal distribution , and 95% of correct assignments fall within \n two standard deviations of the mean error , we removed peptides whose mass error was dramatically higher than \n for other peptides within the same analytical run .\nin a similar manner , \n high mass accuracy ms / ms data facilitates spectral verification .\nleucine \n and isoleucine are indistinguishable from one another by exact mass \n and chemical deamidation can convert glutamine and asparagine to glutamic \n acid and aspartic acid , respectively .\nfurthermore , the carbamidomethyl \n group ( 57.02146 ) has the same exact mass as a glycine residue .\ntherefore , \n species formed due to overalkylation ( addition to nucleophilic amino \n acid side chains or the peptide n - terminus ) can be assigned incorrectly \n as being due to savs .\ntherefore , it is often critical to have orthogonal \n validation of savs at the transcript level .\nms / ms is presented in table 1 . a further list of sav - containing peptides that \n require additional transcript level validation is provided in supporting information table 2 . each identified peptide containing\n, \n we evaluated the individual reads from the transcriptome sequencing \n to quantitate the frequency of c ( acg coding thr ) and g ( agg coding \n arg ) alleles .\nthe c  g variant occurs at position 613 in the \n reference mrna sequence of bcat2 nm_001190 ( rs11548193 in dbsnp ) .\na total of 8 gsc lines contained reads of > 50% \n with c613 g variant , including gscs 28 , 274 , 711 , 275 , 17 , \n 280 , 289 , and 293 ( data not shown ) .\nthe successful identification of sav proteoforms \n in gscs was further \n validated by srm .\nselected unique peptide sequences with a single \n mutation were synthesized and srm assays were developed using multiple \n transitions for each peptide ( supporting information table 3 ) .\na subset of ten gsc samples ( gscs 28 , 627 , 20 , \n 112 , 129 , 522 , 275 , 711 , 274 , and 72 ) was \n tested for four newly identified mutant proteoforms .\nthe primary target \n of srm confirmation was the bcat2 p.thr186arg mutation \n that was unambiguously verified in samples gsc 28 , gsc 711 , \n and gsc 275 by perfectly matching transitions and retention times \n of heavy labeled internal standard and native peptides ( see figure 2a ) .\n( a ) bcat2 p.thr186arg was confirmed by matching heavy -

a2 mutation ( q99961 - 2 p.leu95ile ) was investigated ( see figure 2b ) . besides their validation power\n, srm assays can be further utilized \n in quantitative analysis of mutant allele expressions in biological \n samples .\nthis information is necessary in the case of heterozygous \n samples , in particular when the expression of the mutant allele has \n a strong concordance with biological activity of cells .\nthe p.thr186arg mutation on bcat2 , confirmed at the rna level to be in eight of \n the 36 gsc lines , is located along a flexible loop in close proximity \n to the cxxc center ( figure 3 ) . to study the \n possible effects of this mutation\n, we generated 78 p.thr186arg bcat2 variant structures by rotating the arginine side chain about \n the 1 and 2 and scanning the  \n backbond .\nthe structures that where highest \n in electrostatic free energy or contained severe violations of the \n chemical constrains were removed from the data set . of the structures \n\nlowest in electrostatic free energy , which satisfied the packing and \n stereochemical constraints in minimization , four were grouped within \n a few kilocalories per meters , whereas the rest were separated by \n over 100 kcal / m in electrostatic free energy and so were not considered \n for further analysis .\nbest four bcat2 p.thr186arg structures \n are superimposed \n with arg186 , glu229 , and the cxxc ( cys321 and cys324 ) highlighted . \n among rotamers with residues 177188 minimized ,\nthe four overlaid \n here were hundreds of kcal / m lower than the average of all rotamers . \n\nthe arginine side chain is found in a salt bridge with glu229 and \n toward the inside of the flexible arm , where the arginine side chain \n has the most stable hydrogen bonding .\nthese lower energy positions \n of the arginine side chain all greatly change the electrostatic environment \n as compared with the thr186 wild type , and this may influence the \n cxxc oxidation reaction that regulates enzyme activity . as seen by the four lowest energy structures ( figure 3 )\n, the arg186 side chain gravitates toward the carboxylate \n group of glu229 , as well as inward toward the cxxc site , both of which \n provide stability through hydrogen bonding pairs . compared with the \n thr186 wild type\n, the arginine side chain significantly changes the \n electrostatic environment near the cxxc , potentially shifting the \n pka of the cysteine residues . the electrostatically \n induced pka shift could influence the \n cysteine protonation state and therefore the equilibrium of the oxidation \n reaction ( figure 4 ) , consequently altering \n enzyme activity . although direct interaction , for example , through \n hydrogen bonding , is not sterically forbidden ,\nit is also not required . \n the electrostatic shift of the intrinsic pka of the cysteine would be sufficient to explain a change in activity . \n\nit has been demonstrated that the cxxc center ( cys321 and cys324 ) \n contributes to enzyme activity through reversible disulfide bond formation \n that prevents substrate from correctly orienting with the pyridoxal \n phosphate ( plp ) cofactor .\nreaction mechanism for \n bcat2 , which catalyzes the transfer of an \n amino group from leucine , isoleucine , and valine to -ketoglutarate \n to form glutamate .\nwe demonstrated the utility of our custom protein database in the \n identification of chromosome 19 savs in gscs . through a combination \n of homology searching and manual verification of spectra identified \n by peaks db\none of these savs , \n bcat2 p.thr186arg , was validated orthogonally in \n multiple cell lines by srm and by rna - seq future studies will be directed \n toward verification of the remainder of these savs and a study of \n the biological implications of these savs . the identification and \n characterization of savs in glioma\nhas already yielded the identity \n proteins that will be of further interest to study as potential modulators \n of gliomagenesis , contributors to glioma pathology , and resistance \n to standard of care treatments .\nwe expect that our methods are readily \n transferrable to other cancer cells and tissues as well . to \n improve visibility of savs , we strongly suggest extending the \n registry of protein sequences in nextprot with information about the \n mutant proteoforms pointing to identification levels as well as expression \n sites ."}

b and formation of vitamin d2 at 01,000 mj cm supplementary uv - b during the growth phase .\nthe outputs from the linear regressions were very similar with a - factors of 0.118 and 0.108 for the range of 0250 mj cm and 01,000 mj cm , respectively , and high correlation coefficients ( fig . 2a and b ) .\nthe linearity of the relationship found in these two experiments was previously reported by roberts et al .\n2008 ( 6 ) following post - harvest exposure in the range of 5001,000 mj cm supplementary uv - b after overnight cooling of white button mushrooms . however , in the present study , the a - factor of the linear regression was 0.11 at exposure during the growth phase , compared to 0.06 calculated from roberts et al .\nthus , exposure , for example , to 500 mj cm during the growth phase formed vitamin d2 of approximately 57 g 100 g fresh weight compared to 37 g 100 g at post - harvest exposure ( 6 ) .\nhowever , the difference between the two studies can not be ascribed to a higher efficiency of vitamin d2 conversion at exposure during the growth phase . in the present study , mushrooms sampled after overnight cooling and post - harvest exposure\nwere found to have a higher vitamin d2 content compared to those exposed during the growth phase , and this difference was not caused by effects of overnight cooling on dry matter content ( table 1 ) .\nthe higher conversion of vitamin d2 in the present study compared with that of roberts et al .\n( 2008 ) ( 6 ) was probably caused by differences in spectral distribution of the uv - b from different types of lamps .\nalso , experimental conditions , such as temperature and moisture content , have been shown to affect the formation of vitamin d2 ( 5 ) .\norientation of the mushrooms to the uv source has also been a factor that contributes to vitamin d2 level , that is , the content of vitamin d2 varies within an individual mushroom ( 8) ; however , in this study and that of roberts et al .\nfinally , also the difference between our hplc - dad and the lc - ms / ms methods used in ( 6 ) may give a bias in the results . \n  the relationship between vitamin d2 concentration in mushrooms and exposure to uv - b dose up to 250 mj cm in experiment a and up to 2,400 mj cm in experiment b. error bars\nindicate standard errors in experiment a ( n=4 ) , and in experiment b for the highest dose ( n=6 ) .\nthe effect of source of uv - b and timing of exposure in relation to harvest on vitamin d2 in wild and cultivated agaricus mushrooms   within columns means followed by different letters are significantly different .\nmeans followed by the same letter are not ( p<0.05 ; n=4 ) ; samples taken from other flush .\nthe formation of vitamin d2 levelled off at a content of 164 g 100 g at the high dose of 2,400 mj cm supplementary uv - b as also reported for doses beyond 1,200 mj cm by others ( 5 , 6 ) . in this study ,\na clear browning effect was observed on the surface of the exposed mushrooms indicating that at high doses of uv - b , there was damage to the surface cells ( 8) . it has been suggested that high doses of uv cause photodegradation of vitamin d2 ( 3 ) .\nthus , very high doses of uv - b are relatively less efficient for conversion of ergosterol to vitamin d2 and cause surface discolouration .\nuv - b exposure did not affect the growth rate of the mushrooms in experiment a ( fig .\nthe average yields were 2.25 , 4.83 and 3.36 kg m , and the number of mushrooms were 236 , 322 and 163 pieces m on the first , second and third day of the flush , respectively .\nthe dry matter contents were 8.4 , 8.3 and 9.3 g 100 g , respectively .\nover the three days , the vitamin d2 content of mushrooms decreased sharply from 24 to 3 g 100 g when measured after one exposure at 200 mj cm of supplementary uv - b ( fig .\nthis decrease was observed mainly from the first to the second day of the experiment . by day 3\n, 94% of the vitamin d2 formed during one exposure to uv - b on day 1 could be accounted for in the large harvested and the small remaining mushrooms ( table 2 ) .\nthus , the fast growth rate of the mushrooms diluted the vitamin d2 formed after the exposure on day 1 , as the high recovery of vitamin d2 indicated that there was no significant degradation or transport of vitamin d2 from the mushrooms . \n  the yield of mushrooms obtained during the three days of experiment a after ( a ) no exposure to uv - b , exposure to supplementary uv - b of 200 mj cm , ( b ) the first day and ( c ) repeated every day .\nthe vitamin d2 concentration in mushrooms found during the three days of experiment a after exposure to supplementary uv - b of 200 mj cm ( a ) the first day , and ( b ) repeated every day .\nrecovery of vitamin d2 calculated on basis of production area for three days of experiment a after one exposure to supplementary uv - b of 200 mj cm the first day based on the biomass of small remaining mushrooms and the assumption that their vitamin d2 content equalled that measured in large harvested mushrooms .\nwhen the uv - b exposure was repeated at daily intervals ( day 13 ) , the vitamin d2 content increased to 33 g 100 g. these results suggest that repeated exposure to uv - b is needed just prior to harvest and during all days of a flush to ensure a high level of vitamin d2 in the final product .\nthe increase in the vitamin d2 content after repeated exposure may be explained by a carryover of vitamin d2 formed in the small mushrooms left growing for the next day .\nthere was no indication that one exposure to uv - b stimulated or inhibited the formation of vitamin d2 at later exposures .\nthe vitamin d2 content was much lower in cultivated mushrooms exposed to sunlight of 200 mj cm uv - b or in wild mushrooms samples compared to mushrooms exposed to supplementary uv - b ( table 1 ) .\nthe samples of cultivated mushrooms without exposure to uv - b or of miscellaneous origin ( strains and producers ) were found to have the lowest content of vitamin d2 . to our knowledge\n, the vitamin d2 content of 1.5 g 100 g is the first report on wild agaricus sp . , while higher contents have been reported for other wild grown species such as cantharellus cibarius and c. tubaeformis ( 1013 and 2130 g 100 g , respectively ) as well as for boletus edulis ( 359 g 100 g ) ( 1 , 2 ) . the low vitamin d2 contents of wild agaricus sp .\nand cultivated a. bisporus exposed to 200 mj cm uv - b in sunlight were surprising considering the results of other reports and the present study of cultivated a. bisporus forming high amounts of vitamin d2 when exposed to supplementary uv - b ( 6 , 4 , 8) . even though a. bisporus does not produce as high levels of vitamin d2 after uv exposure as wild c. tubaeformis ( 2 ) and cultivated pleurotus ostreatus ( 5 ) .\nthe difference between the effect of uv - b from sunlight and from the supplementary uv - b unit may have been caused by differences in the distribution of wavelengths within the range of uv - b that are integrated in the measurement of the uv - b sensor .\nthe tubes of the uv - b unit emit some radiation of wavelengths shorter than 290 nm ( fig .\n1 ) , which is the part of the uv - b range that is almost absent in sunlight after absorption in the earth 's atmosphere ( 9 ) .\nthis short - waved uv - b is close to the uv - c range that has , however , been found to be less effective than uv - b in the conversion of ergosterol to vitamin d2 ( 5 ) .\nlentinus edodes was found to have higher vitamin d2 content when harvested on sunny as compared to cloudy days ( 10 as reported in ( 4 ) ) .\nthe uv - exposure is similar to the exposure of wild mushrooms that is not reported to cause toxic elements in mushrooms .\nthe level of vitamin d2 content in wild and cultivated mushrooms with or without exposure to sunlight ( table 1 ) is comparable to that of , for example , 0.40.7 g of vitamin d3 in 100 g of pork and beef meat and 0.20.4 g of vitamin d3 in 100 g of a variety of cheeses ( www.foodcomp.dk ) .\ncommercial growers may consider using uv - b during the growth phase for vitamin d2 formation in white button mushrooms . in this case , the need for prolonged exposure time is less critical as treatment times do not have to be confined to the time available during the post - harvest processing on a conveyor belt .\ninstead , an automatic moving uv - b unit can be constructed , for example , for overnight exposure of mushrooms on the growing shelves just prior to harvest . with the high intensities used in the present study , doses of 200 mj\ncm could be obtained with an exposure time of < 2 min and resulting in vitamin d2 contents of around 24 g 100 g. at this vitamin d2 level , approximately 35 g of mushroom is equivalent to the recommended daily intake of 7.5 g vitamin d2 for adults in denmark .\nthe upper safe limit for daily intake of 50 g vitamin d2 should be taken into consideration ( 11 ) .\nmushrooms with a vitamin d2 content of 24 g 100 g would contribute to 26% of the recommended daily intake of 7.5 g based on the average intake of mushrooms by adults of 3 kg yr in 2006 in denmark ( 12 ) . therefore , uv - b - enhanced vitamin d2 levels in mushrooms provide a potentially important food source of vitamin d.\nthe close to linear relationship between uv - b dose and formation of vitamin d2 at exposure just prior to harvest makes it possible to produce mushrooms with a well - defined content of vitamin d2 .\ntherefore , mushroom products will be a rich source for increased intake of vitamin d2 in food . due to the dilution of vitamin d2 by the fast growth of the mushrooms , uv - b exposure needs to be repeated daily during the harvest flush to maintain a high content of vitamin d2 in the end product .\nsupplementary uv - b from tubes is a more effective source of uv - b for the formation of vitamin d2 in mushrooms as compared to natural sunlight that gave a low content of vitamin d2 equivalent to that found in wild agaricus sp . mushrooms .\nthis work was supported by the danish food industry agency , the committee for horticultural sale and egehej champignon a / s ."}

nave patients presented at least one ns3/4a pis rav .\nthe most prevalent variant was s122 g ( 56.6% ) , which has been confirmed as one of the major ravs of simeprevir ( one of the first - generation second - wave pis ) . in concerto trial conducted in japan ,\nthe baseline prevalence of s122 g variant was relatively lower ( 34.9% ) than that of our findings , while the baseline prevalence of v170i variant was relatively higher ( 39.6% vs. 13.1% ) than our findings .\nt54s variant detected in our study was also correlated with resistance to simeprevir , with relatively low prevalence ( 5.5% ) .\nmutations associated with first - generation first - wave pis detected in this study were t54s ( telaprevir and boceprevir ) , s122 g ( telaprevir ) , and v170i ( telaprevir ) . however , these ravs only conferred low - level resistance to these two licensed daas . with respect to other reports\n, none of other baseline polymorphisms correlated with treatment outcomes of pis were detected in our study .\nfor example , r155k and d168e / v variants were ravs of asunaprevir ( had licensed in combination with daclatasvir as interferon [ ifn]-free regimens in japan ) and mk-5172 ( one of the second generation pis ) , none of which were found .\nthis discrepancy might be due to the fact that virus of different quasispecies even within the same subtype has different mutations . since all of the ravs detected by ultra - deep sequencing could be detected by population sequencing\n, we can conclude that population sequencing could qualified for baseline pis ravs screening in china .\nas one of the most important ravs of most of the ns5a protein inhibitors , y93h variants were detected in 10.1% of patients included in our study .\nl31 m variants , another mutation associated with treatment outcomes of ldv , daclatasvir , and abt-267 , were only detected by ultra - deep sequencing in three patients with low mutation frequencies .\nseveral in vitro studies have reported that single l31 m variant could only lead to 3-fold change with ec50 of daclatasvir .\nsingle y93h variant could lead to 24-fold change of it while combination mutations of l31 m plus y93h could lead to 7105-fold change with ec50 of daclatasvir . in addition , single y93h variant could lead to 77-fold change of ec50 of abt-267 while l31 m plus y93h could lead to 142-fold change of it .\nwhat 's more , y93h variant could lead to extremely high - level ( 994-fold ) fold - change with ec50 of ldv .\nalthough ns5a protein inhibitors were usually used in combination with pis ( such as asunaprevir ) , baseline polymorphisms of l31 m or y93h could make patients to experience virologic relapse more easily and achieved much lower svr rates .\ndata by ultra - deep sequencing revealed that most of the ns5a protein inhibitors ravs detected here were with relatively high mutation frequencies , except for l31 m variants .\nnevertheless , l31 m variants occurred only in three patients with low mutation frequencies . in this way\n, population sequencing might be qualified for baseline ns5a protein inhibitors ravs screening in china .\nthe detection of naturally occurring ravs of ns5b polymerase inhibitors at baseline has been reported in numerous studies . some of them may influence the treatment outcomes of daas - containing regimens . in the clinical trials of sof - containing regimens ,\nthe primary concern lies in the s282 t , an important variant associated with treatment - failure .\nhowever , a representative study conducted by fda from the us suggested that ns5b - c316n was found to be associated with treatment failure when patients chc genotype 1b receiving sof plus rbv therapy , throughout re - systemizing all the data from sof - containing trials where ultra - deep sequencing was performed . in the clinical trial p7977 - 2025 , 16/61 posttransplantation patients failed therapy of sof plus rbv , where 6/16 patients harbored c316n at baseline , in other words , all of the six patients did not achieve svr . on the contrary , for the other 45 patients who achieved svr12 ,\neighty - two percent ( 45/55 ) of the patients who did not carry c316n pretreatment achieved svr12 .\nhowever , 66.7% ( 4/6 ) of patients harbored l159f at the same time . in clinical trial neutrino , 4/66 of the patients harbored c316n variant at baseline , 50% of which ( 2/4 ) experienced virologic relapse after receiving treatment of sof plus rbv . in this trial ,\nrav c316n is located in palm ii ( allosteric ) . despite the fact that the majority of ravs of sof reported are at the active sites ( such as s282 t and n142 t )\n, position 316 was deemed as the only different residue within 8 a in the ns5b polymerase between hcv genotype 1a and 1b .\nn316 in hcv gt1b polymerase structure is much larger than c316 , which might lead to the block of the active site of sof .\nhowever , c316 has been reported to be relatively conserved in gt1a , but polymorphic in gt1b .\ndata from los alamos databank showed that the prevalence of c316n was much higher in asia than worldwide ( 91.6% vs. 36% ) as well as american continent ( from 0% to 18% ) . in our study , both the ultra - deep sequencing and population sequencing revealed that the prevalence of c316n variant in treatment - nave chinese gt1b chc patients was quite high , which is in good agreement with previous findings .\nas part of ifn - free regimens , sof in combination with ldv with and without rbv has been one of the most important regimens nowadays . combination treatment could help patients to overcome antiviral resistance more easily .\n, data showed that the patient presented ns5a - l31m - y93h joined variants as previously stated , simultaneously harbored ns5b - c316n . even in the combination regimens of sof plus ldv , baseline polymorphisms of y93h\nresults by ultra - deep sequencing showed that the mutation frequencies increased dramatically at the time of relapse . both rav\ns282 t and n142 t were at the active site of ns5b polymerase , but none of the 137 patients exhibited the existence of these two variants .\nsince most of the patients presented ravs of one category , cross - resistance seems less likely to occur .\ndata by ultra - deep sequencing revealed that most of the ns5b polymerase inhibitors ravs detected here were with high mutation frequencies , especially for c316n variants .\nnevertheless , l419 m variants occurred only in two patients with low mutation frequencies . in this way\n, population sequencing might qualify for baseline ns5b polymerase inhibitors ravs screening in china . in conclusion , we have employed both the ultra - deep sequencing and population sequencing methods to detect daas ravs in genotype 1b treatment - nave patients , among which the prevalence of variants related with treatment - failure of ns3/4a pis ( s122 g ) , ns5b polymerase inhibitors ( c316n ) and ns5a inhibitors ( y93h ) were quite high , in particular , c316n . currently high prevalence and high mutation frequencies of rav c316n in china might impede the virologic response when distributing sof - containing regimens in the near future .\nour findings suggest that pretreatment sequencing of hcv genome might need to be performed when patients infected with gt1b hcv receiving daas - containing regimens in china .\nthis work was supported by grants from the china national science and technology major project for infectious diseases control during the 11th 5-year plan period ( no . 2008zx10002 -

{"id": 77, "text": "whilst both natural evolutionary processes and modern genetic selection result in phenotypic changes , the mechanisms that determine the changes are quite different .\nthe environmental pressures are managed through intervention strategies such as providing high quality feeds , artificial housing or drugs to restrict disease .\nthese intervention strategies are energy dense and enable agriculture to maximize outputs ( productivism ) ; however , they result in populations that are unable to withstand the pressure of more  natural environments . in some cases , the extreme selection for a single trait can result in physiological breakdown as resources are channelled towards particular production proteins .\nthis study explores how evolutionary genetics might help inform modern cattle breeding programmes and shows some examples from tropically adapted cattle .\nwe consider the importance of environmental stress for identifying robust genotypes in production systems that will increasingly need to focus on efficiency rather than total productivity . since the 1950s in the developed countries , the era of agricultural productivism emerged with a corresponding demise in the influence of natural selection in livestock production systems .\nlivestock productivism was characterized by a significant use of technology , both mechanization and biotechnology , to maximize productive output .\nthis productivism was facilitated by relatively abundant cheap fossil fuels ; environmental regulation removed environmental stressors to allow intensification , concentration and specialization of the systems ( ilbery and bowler 1998 ) .\nthe genetic diversity of both bos taurus and bos indicus cattle was reduced with the concentration on breeds and sires within breeds that had the highest production potential .\nmore recently , there has been a trend for a measured increase in productivity and growing pressure for cattle production systems to manage their total carbon budgets , which will require a reduction in their greenhouse gas emissions .\nthe reduction in the use of fossil fuel derived energy and nutrients ( direct : fuel and fertilizer ; indirect : acaricide , anthelmintics and vaccine ) will reduce the ability to manage directly environmental stress . a paradigm shift in priorities\nis therefore required  more diverse genotypes that are productive in a range of environments will need to be developed . the evolutionary path of cattle since domestication provides insight into the current fitness levels as well as a better understanding of the interactions between cattle genotypes , environments and management intervention strategies ( hence forth called g  e  m interactions ) .\nthere has been a long history of domestication and implicit genetic selection ; however , systematic breeding programmes have only been used over the last 60 years .\nthese breeding programmes have enabled cattle to meet specific roles : predominantly supplying meat and milk for human consumption .\nhowever , a recent article published in science ( the bovine hapmap consortium 2009 ) looked at the process of cattle domestication . their analyses ( based on mutation rate , inbreeding rate , linkage disequilibrium levels , etc . ) revealed that cattle have undergone a rapid recent decrease in effective population size from a very large ancestral population , possibly due to bottlenecks associated with domestication , selection and breed formation .\nhence , any future proposal for evolutionary management of cattle domestication should consider this worldwide structure of the breeds to design conservation programmes and mating schemes . the reduction in the ancestral population diversity has important implications for breeding programmes in the 21st century . the opportunity for modern cattle breeds to evolve in response to environmental stress is restricted as the diversity of the gene pool of cattle populations diminishes . however , there are examples of cattle breeds that have demonstrated rapid evolutionary change : in particular where b. taurus cattle have been reared in challenging tropical environments .\nshorthorn ) that has undergone a relatively rapid transition from extreme susceptibility to extreme resistance to cattle tick via a synergy between natural and artificial selection for tick resistance ( frisch 1981 ; hetzel et al . 1990 ; frisch et al . 2000 ) .\nthe evolution of the adaptaur under tropical stress provides a model approach to cattle breeding , which , if applied within the broader livestock industries might determine more favourable genotypes especially in the advent of escalating environmental stress due to climate change .\nthis study explores the consequences of selection for production traits and demonstrates evolutionary genetics of taurine cattle in both temperate ( favourable ) and tropical ( unfavourable ) environments . as an example of evolutionary adaptation we focus on the adaptaur from northern australia ; however , we also draw on examples from three other b. taurus breeds that all have evolutionary backgrounds in unfavourable environments : senepol from the caribbean , the criollo breed group from central and south america and the n'dama from west africa .\nwe show how exposure to a specific environmental stress ( cattle tick infestation in a tropical environment ) demonstrates the potential for experimental evolution to generate new more robust genotypes that can perform in environmentally stressful environments .\ngenetic adaptation of cattle for a successful transition into the postproductivism era must incorporate alleles of economic importance from genotypes adapted to potentially more stressful environments .\nthe principles of evolutionary genetics can be used to facilitate darwinian fitness in future livestock breeding programmes to generate optimal genotypes for a low - cost and environmentally sustainable production system .\nin essence , there are complex interactions between genotype , environment and management ( g  e  m ) in the livestock systems and the implications relate to : ( i ) fitting the right genotypes to the right environments and production systems and ( ii ) determining the optimal genotype across a range of environments and production systems .\nwe provide some perspectives on g  e  m and how this could contribute to evolution of future strains or breeds of cattle .\nabout 10 000 years bp ( before present ) , neolithic hunter - gathers began to domesticate simultaneously both b. taurus ( fertile crescent and saharan africa ) and b. indicus ( indian subcontinent ) ( bradley et al .\n2010 ) . the history of b. indicus in asia ( harris 1992 ) , and more recent introduction to africa via the african east coast about 3500 years bp ( hanotte et al .\n2002 ) , is notable for the high levels of environmental stress associated with indicine evolution .\nthe heterosis achieved from b. taurus  b. indicus crossbreeding is well documented ( e.g. mcdowell et al . 1996 ) .\nhowever , some african taurine breeds , such as n'dama , were able to survive in stressful tropical environments with little or no b. indicus hybridization1 ( frisch et al .\n2007 ) . in europe , b. taurus accompanied neolithic man 's conversion from nomadic hunter - gatherer to a sedentary agriculturalist and cattle evolved adaptations to temperate climates . under various celtic ,\ngermanic and nordic tribes , there was a general divergence of the larger continental breeds ( e.g. charolais , simmental ) from the medium - sized british breeds ( e.g. hereford , red poll , murray grey ) and specialization into dairy ( e.g. holstein , jersey ) , beef ( e.g. angus , shorthorn ) and dual purpose ( e.g. brown swiss ) . in the developed regions of europe\n, cattle increased their propensity to supply meat and milk through increased industrialization and dedicated breeding programmes .\neuropean taurine cattle were also subjected to the stressors of tropical and semi - arid regions as these cattle were a significant component of the human colonization of central and south america by the spanish and portuguese during the 16th century .\ncattle from the colonization were collectively known as creole or criollo,2 and adapted to the environments that ranged from semi - arid to the wet tropics ( russell et al .\nalso regarded as tropically adapted is the senepol , a two - breed composite of n'dama and red poll cattle , bred on the caribbean island of st croix in 1918 ( hammond et al .\nherefords and shorthorns , first imported into australia from united kingdom in 1826 , along with the south african cattle breed , africander imported from king ranch , texas , usa in 1953 formed part of a csiro research programme at the belmont research station , rockhampton in the 1950s ( kennedy and turner 1959 ) .\nselection lines within a four - breed composite of africander , brahman , hereford and shorthorn , commercialized as belmont red , and a two - breed composite of hereford and shorthorn ( hs line ) were established .\nmodern genetic selection programmes are capable of delivering cumulative gains of 12% per annum for the trait ( or combination of traits ) under selection ( simm et al .\nquantitative genetic methods have been a crucial component of productivism : development of selection index principles in animal breeding programmes in early 1940s ( hazel and lush 1943 ) followed by application of best linear unbiased prediction ( blup ) of animal 's genetic merit from early 1970s : the animal model ( henderson 1975 ) .\nthese methods accurately quantify breeding potential ( estimated breeding values or ebvs ; expected progeny differences or epds ) for economically important traits and are expressed in real units of measurement ( e.g. kg for growth rate ) . to assess the relative superiority of a bull or a cow , the animal 's ebv is compared with those reported by a breed average . with continuing advances in statistical and computing technology , quantitative geneticists successfully refined and modified blup methodology as new performance records ( e.g. on daily growth ) and associated new traits became available . utilizing these sophisticated levels of technologies , livestock industries of the developed countries\nhave achieved significant increases in the product quantity and quality within the optimal ( i.e. stress - free ) environments ( rauw et al .\nhigh performance under these stress - free environments does not , however , imply high performance in all environments . whilst quantitative genetic techniques have successfully identified superior performing individuals and selectively bred from them , the selection process has been largely under increasingly optimal environments ( i.e. stress - free ) .\nthere is an emerging question of the costs of  stress - free selection as genotypes are exposed to more stressful environments .\nwhilst management intervention has increasingly reduced environmental stress the ability for an individual to respond has decreased as genetic selection has refined metabolic pathways towards product output at the expense of other traits such as disease resistance .\nproduction diseases ( e.g. lameness and metabolic and reproductive disorders ) , in parallel with increasing levels of milk production ( lucy 2001 ; mulligan and doherty 2008 ; ward 2009 ) .\nhowever , research and breeding programmes of dairy cattle have started to shift emphasis from production - only traits in the breeding goal to traits that are associated with robustness ( e.g. resistance to clinical mastitis , lameness and milk fever ) and sustainability ( e.g. fertility , feed efficiency , conformation , optimal behaviour ) ( distl 2000 ; kadarmideen et al . 2000 ; kadarmideen and pryce 2001 ; neuenschwander et al . 2005 ) .\nbeef cattle breed societies have gone down a similar path to the dairy industries with the emphasis on performance recording production traits . in beef cattle breeding ,\ngrowth , calving ease , reproduction and meat quality traits such as muscle and/or fat depth and tenderness are the main drivers of commercial operations . as with the dairy industries\nthere has been an increase in persistent production diseases in the beef industries ; namely respiratory diseases and metabolic disorders in the feedlot systems ( e.g. owens et al .\ncontinuing outbreaks of the ocular disease called infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis ( ibk ) also generates significant economic and welfare issues for the cattle industries ( brown et al .\nthese problems have been addressed through research to develop animal management protocols , feed additives , pharmacological agents and vaccines to combat the diseases ( quigley et al .\nenvironment control strategy . however , genetic methods for the identification of host resistance / susceptibility for diseases such as ibk in the us department of agriculture reference cattle population ( casas and stone 2006 ) and australian adaptaur cattle ( ali et al .\nthe animal model can be used to evaluate genetic merit of animals for traits associated with the production diseases described above ( heringstad et al .\nit is not only possible to select animals for just one trait , but rather a combination of traits .\nhence , animals ebvs for different traits ( e.g. growth , reproductive success and some measures of adaptability like ibk resistance ) are combined to form an aggregate or total breeding value ( tbv ) .\ntherefore , a multi - trait breeding objective would appear as : where   is the total breeding value , bi is an economic weight for the ith trait in breeding objective , ebvi is the ebv for the ith trait and n is the number of traits in the breeding goal .\nbreeders can modify their herd 's genetics based on assigning different economic weights to different traits ; for instance if adaptability or disease resistance is more important than other traits in tropical environments , then there needs to be higher weights for those traits in the breeding goal .\napplication of these novel methods has had major beneficial effects on the cost and quality of food , and on the efficiency , competitiveness and welfare status of the livestock industries concerned .\nthe incorporation of resistance traits ensures that the tbv is also driven by evolutionary principles of adaptation .\nhowever , in any breeding programme the animal 's physiological limits must be considered . in production systems of negligible environmental stress ,\nthe need for both energy and physiological mechanisms to alleviate stress are not required . in theory , the metabolic energy is therefore available for production traits but with continued selection for high production the dairy cow is unable to consume enough energy to meet this production potential and the cow 's fertility ( butler and smith 1989 ; kadarmideen et al .\n2003 ; wathes et al . 2009 ) and health ( ingvartsen et al . 2003 ; zuerner et al . 2007 ; mulligan and doherty 2008 ) suffer as a consequence .\nmoreover , a number of studies have shown a negative relationship between metabolic rate and resistance to stress ( see parsons 1990 and hoffmann and parsons 1991 ) .\nanimals of low resistance to environmental stress have inherently higher rates of growth , appetite and fasting metabolism than animals relatively resistant to environmental stress ( frisch and vercoe 1984 ) .\nthus , selection for production traits , disregarding physiological limits , fertility and resistance to environmental stress , would have serious negative consequences for future cattle herds as cows can only be maintained with high inputs that are unsustainable in the longer term .\nthe three main genetic processes involved in the evolution of animals during domestication are selection , genetic drift and inbreeding ( falconer and mackay 1996 ) , and inbreeding is posing additional problems for the intensive cattle industries .\ninbreeding can lead to loss of fitness and even survival of a breed or species . for the dairy industry in the usa ,\n( 1998 ) found that the effects of inbreeding in the holstein herd , years 19831993 , were cumulative and larger on lifetime profit functions than on lactation traits .\ntechniques are now available to control inbreeding using conventional blup methods ( villanueva et al .\n2006 ) or using molecular genetic markers in genetic improvement programmes ( e.g. li et al . 2008 ) .\nhence , any future breeding programmes must be designed to manage inbreeding depression ( kearney et al .\ncattle breeds of the developed countries have been subjected to breeding programmes that are not sustainable and inappropriate for determining genotypes that are productive in unfavourable environments .\nstern and orgogozo ( 2009 ) suggest that there is a need to identify and select specific mutations without negative consequences .\nwe argue that for cattle of the 21st century it will be necessary to also explore the evolution of cattle in unfavourable environments , where there has been selection for alleles at many loci offering specific environmental adaptations .\nthe next section provides some examples of breeding programmes that have identified desirable genetics contributing to adaptations of temperate cattle breeds to unfavourable tropical environments .\nmodern agricultural populations of plants and animals have shown rapid evolutionary adaptation to environmental stress in timeframes of decades ( or less ) ( thompson 1998 ; bell and collins 2008 ; campbell et al .\nenvironmental stress is defined as an environmental force , from either biotic or abiotic factors , that impairs an animal 's regulatory mechanism to such an extent that fitness is compromised .\nfitness , an animal 's ability to grow and reproduce viable offspring will be adversely affected if the animal is unable to mount an appropriate response to the stressor via means of its physiology and/or behaviour .\nthe degree of sensitivity to these stressors , or homeostasis , will be regarded as an aspect of fitness ( falconer and mackay 1996 ) . in a relatively short period of time , european b. taurus relocated from temperate to tropical regions and had to achieve higher fitness in the presence of tropical stressors .\nthis higher fitness was achieved through the application of evolutionary principles within a genetic selection program .\nthe response to environmental stress involves a synergy between behaviour and physiological adaptation ( hart 1990 ; hoffmann and parsons 1991 ; lomborg et al . 2008 ) . documenting\nthe plethora of tropical environmental stressors and the corresponding responses of b. taurus to these stressors is beyond the scope of this study .\ntherefore , we present data from experiments that aimed to assess the evolutionary adaptation of b. taurus cattle to stress from infestations of the ectoparasite cattle tick rhipicephalus ( boophilus ) microplus .\ncattle tick infestations have a substantial negative impact on host fitness ( frisch and vercoe 1984 ; lehmann 1993 ) . by the end of last century , estimates of the yearly global costs of cattle tick and tick - borne diseases were between us$13.9 and us$18.7 billion ( de castro 1997 ) . the global costs of ticks are set to escalate ; increasing levels of acaricide resistance ( sangster 2001 ) , limited efficacy of anti - tick vaccines and emergence of nonresponders to vaccination ( outteridge 1993 ; sonenshine et al . 2006 ) , the genetic antagonism on fitness traits from biased artificial selection for production traits ( frisch 1981 ; kadarmideen et al . 2000 ) and the potential negative impact of climate change ( white et al . 2003 ) .\nexploring the full repertoire of the animal 's anti - tick mechanisms is warranted if genetic technologies that utilize naturally occurring adaptation to parasitic stress are going to contribute to sustainable livestock production .\neuropean taurine cattle , such as the criollo in the 1500s , were relocated to their respective tropical environments from temperate environments that were free of parasites endemic in the tropics .\na similar case occurred in 1952 with the introduction of herefords and shorthorns ( hs line ) on the csiro belmont research station , a property located 26 km nnw of rockhampton , in north - eastern australia .\nas a research station located in the tropics , acaricide was initially used routinely to treat tick infestations but from 1966 it was used only as an experimental treatment or to prevent mortalities from tick infestations ( frisch 1981 ) . thus on belmont , there was a need to select european b. taurus cattle which had anti - parasitic mechanisms to enable them to survive and maintain fitness .\ncattle , as with other herbivores , have evolved various anti - tick mechanisms : multiple immunological processors , hypersensitivity and exudate and grooming behaviour ( riek 1962 ; roberts 1968a ; schleger et al . 1981 ; brossard and wikel 2004 ) . roberts ( 1968b ) also showed that rejection of larvae on b. taurus occurred within 24 h of infestation and the effect was greater in animals resistant to tick .\nas pointed out by roberts ( 1968b ) the early mortality of larvae has implications for the restricted transmission of such tick - borne diseases as babesia bigemina .\na family within the hs line on belmont did acquire extreme resistance to infestations of cattle tick ( frisch et al . 2000 ) .\nthe origins of the adaptaur began on belmont in 1980 with the identification of a heifer ( animal identity : 790546 ) of the 1979 calf crop of the hs line and after 1980 selection for both high growth tick resistance within the hs line focused on this family .\nthe heifer acquired extreme resistance to field infestations of cattle tick soon after weaning ( subsequent counts of zero or one regardless of tick counts of cohorts  see fig . 1 for tick counts of cohorts ) .\nthere was no evidence of hypersensitivity ( j. e. frisch and c. j. o'neill , unpublished data ) and a grooming response to remove larvae within 24 h of infestation ( c. j. o'neill and j. e. frisch , unpublished data ) .\nfigure 1 presents a compilation of tick count data from various studies of the 1980s on adaptation , production or heterosis [ see frisch and vercoe ( 1984 ) , frisch ( 1987 ) , frisch et al .\n( 2000 ) for details of environment , breeding programmes experimental designs and various analyses of data ] .\nthese studies were conducted as a precursor to a major heterosis study conducted during the 1990s , involving breeds of european , indian and african origins , to identify the optimal genotype for herd productivity in a stressful tropical environment ( frisch and o'neill 1998a , b , c ) .\nfigure 1 illustrates that there is a strong tendency in low tick counts of progeny from sires of the 790546 family compared to progeny from sires of the remaining adaptaur herd and progeny from the brahman sires . the focus on the maternal lineage of 790546 not only assisted in rapid reduction in the phenotypic trend in tick count ( fig .\n1 ) , but also a corresponding linear ( r = 0.93 ) genetic trend from 1983 to 1998 of a mean rate of 7 ticks / year of the adaptaur herd ( frisch et al .\narithmetic means ( three highest counts for the calf crop ) ( sem ) of field tick ( rhipicephalus microplus ) infestations of heifer progeny of brahman and adaptaur sires for calf crops 1979 , 19831984 and 19861988 on belmont research station .\nnumber of sires and progeny per group : brahman , 24 sires with 159 progeny , adaptaur maternal lineage 790546 , five sires with 55 progeny , and remaining adaptaur , 20 sires with 109 progeny .\ntwenty - seven years after the identification of heifer 790546 , in 2007 descendents from this heifer exhibited high tick resistance ( table 1 ) and with some straightbred animals ( e.g. animal identities : 060017 and 060031 ) resembling the extreme phenotype of 790546 ( table 2 ) .\ntick count data from an experiment conducted on belmont during november and december 2007 , involving 2-year - old heifers are presented in tables 1 and 2 .\nthis experiment was aimed at studying tick resistance of different breed types and observing host hypersensitivity to tick larvae .\nanimals were sourced for this experiment as follows : there were 15 brahman heifers chosen at random from a calf crop of 140 heifers from belmont research station and the adaptaur and adaptaur crossbreds were sourced locally from commercial seedstock producers vineree and ben m'cree . to restrict the immediate host grooming to remove tick larvae , we fitted a collar to the animal and taped a tube of larvae onto the collar .\nthese cattle were artificially infested with 10 000 two - week - old tick larvae ( r. microplus , queensland department of primary industries and fisheries , yeerongpilly , australia ) . at 48-h postinfestation ,\nthe adaptaur straightbred has not lost its high resistance to cattle tick , even after 27 years ( table 1 ) , and this high tick resistance appears to be conferred to other taurine breeds regardless of their genetic background for tick resistance ( table 2 ) .\nthe finding that some heifers with high counts at 6 months of age have progressively lower counts at 12 months of age and 24 months of age ( table 2 ) confirms that resistance is acquired .\nalthough general hypersensitivity was not observed in this experiment , five of the most tick resistant b. taurus heifers had a small area ( approx .\n5 cm in diameter ) of exudate ranging from minor to excessive at the site of larval release ( table 2 ) , indicating a host immune response to the parasite . by day 15\nthe relatively high weight gain on pasture of the adaptaur straightbred and f1 compared to the brahman ( table 1 ) would suggest that neither the imposition of 10 000 tick larvae nor the adaptaur anti - tick mechanism was detrimental to their productivity .\nthe results presented in tables 1 and 2 suggest a relative advantage of adaptaur and adaptaur cross - over brahmans in tick resistance at the same level of growth . however ,\nif strong conclusions are to be made , a larger sample size in each of the breed classes would be required and a statistical analysis conducted .\nnumber of bos indicus ( straightbred brahman ) and bos taurus ( adaptaur and f1 adaptaur cross ) 24-month - old heifers in each class of tick resistance from an

above heifers at belmont and produced a count of 233 mature ticks by day 21 of the artificial infestation . tick resistance class was based on number of maturing ticks from cumulative tick counts (

to tropical stress so did the european b. taurus .\nthere are a number of adaptation mechanisms that could explain the relatively high levels of resistance to tropical stressors for the adaptaur , n'dama , senepol and criollo breeds .\nthe following scenarios highlight the complexity of disease resistance and pertain to evolutionary genetics : chance mutations , a synergy between natural selection and artificial selection and phenotypic plasticity .\n( 2005 ) contend that the host 's optimum immune response to parasites and pathogens is one of immunosufficiency , because the former is a balance between energy loss due to pathogen infection and energy expenditure mounting an immune response that is conducive to fitness .\nnaessens ( 2006 ) has shown that it is the inappropriate response of the immune system that results in the mortality and morbidity of trypanosome - infected cattle .\nn'dama not only possesses a genetic capacity to control parasitism ( claxton and leperre 1991 ) , but also to avoid anaemia and the severe pathology associated with trypanosome infection ( murray and dexter 1988 ; naessens 2006 ) . a major gene for hair length  slick hair that contributes to improving the animal 's thermoregulatory ability , has been described in both senepol and venezuelan carora  a two - breed composite of brown swiss and local criollo ( olson et al . 2003 ) .\nit could be speculated that the senepol also has the potential for high tick resistance given its n'dama origin and slick coat ( claxton and leperre 1991 ; hammond et al .\no'kelly and spiers ( 1983 ) using animals from the hs line , among other breeds , demonstrated that fewer ticks matured on clipped areas of coat compared to unclipped areas .\nrelative to their temperate origins , the environmental assault on the hs line on belmont was extreme , from solar radiation , heat stress , parasites and periods of poor nutrition , thus creating strong natural selection .\na livestock population surviving with minimal intervention to remove environmental stress , such as not treating the adaptaur with acaricide to remove parasites , means that the population was under natural selection pressure . using both calf survival data and a multi - trait mixed model genetic analysis of growth rates from 1966 to 1981 , hetzel et al .\n( 1990 ) concluded that the fitness of this population was increasing under natural selection .\nmoreover , with the artificial selection protocol in place , selecting sires for high growth rate in a stressful environment ( frisch 1981 ) , was working in synergy with natural selection ( hetzel et al .\nfrisch ( 1981 ) also concluded that the increasing level of resistance to environmental stress was solely responsible for the improved growth rates for this population . since 1983\n, the additional selection protocol of high tick resistance focusing on a single family with selection for high growth rate , confirmed the value of targeting components that positively impact on productivity in a stressful tropical environment .\nthe 33% improvement in calving rates of adaptaur cows from 1992 to 1996 , compared to adaptaurs before selection 19641972 ( o'neill and frisch 1998 ) , is further evidence that high selection intensity ( high growth and high tick resistance ) on fitness traits was successful for european b. taurus in a tropical environment . in a large australian purebred - crossbreeding study from the cooperative research centre for cattle and beef quality , newman et al .\n( 2002 ) found that progeny from belmont red sires produced carcasses with the lowest sub - cutaneous fat and highest retail beef yield , desirable traits for human consumption .\nthe above - mentioned research work with adapted genotypes has highlighted the importance of the synergy between natural and artificial selection for both adaptation and production traits .\nthe transition from unadapted to an adapted state for the n'dama , adaptaur , senepol and criollo could also involve elements of phenotypic plasticity , defined as the ability of a genotype to produce more than one phenotype in response to differing environments ( scheiner 1993 ; de jong 2005 ; fordyce 2006 ) .\ngarland and kelly ( 2006 ) point out that directional selection should support alleles that increase phenotypic plasticity in the direction of selection .\nwhen animal breeders are faced with multiple environments , models of phenotypic plasticity could contribute to the development of appropriate selection programmes for their production system ( de jong and bijma 2002 ) .\nit is conceivable that the mexican criollo from the chihuahuan desert3 possess alleles pertinent to plasticity for variations in water consumption , extreme fluctuations in ambient temperature , metabolism of a variety of herbaceous plants , and alternating between browsing and grazing .\nexistence of such alleles has implications for other semi - arid regions such as the livestock component in the management of dryland salinity of southern australia as described by masters et al .\n( 2006 ) . given the extreme range of environments involved , plus the simultaneous natural and artificial selection pressure applied to achieve fitness , phenotypic plasticity could have contributed to the adaptation of the b. taurus to extreme and highly variable environmental parameters , and therefore future breeding programmes in variable challenging environments .\nextreme environmental conditions that result in high selection intensity on traits directly related to fitness have been shown to impact directly on the evolutionary process .\nsuch high selection intensity tends to rapidly fix pleiotropic genes with predominantly positive effects ( lande 1982 ) .\nhoffmann and parsons ( 1991 ) also point out that short periods ( years , decades ) of high selection intensity , rather than long periods ( century or more ) of low selection intensity , favour genes of major effect in the evolutionary process  hence the emergence of a major gene for  slick hair that contributes to heat resistance in the senepol and carora breeds ( olson et al .\n2003 ) . the identification and evidence of a putative major gene for tick resistance in the adaptaur ( frisch 1994 ; kerr et al .\n1994 ) was not confirmed by henshall ( 2004 ) with additional data and inclusion of polygenic effects in the statistical model .\n( 2009 ) have shown evidence of major gene effects in this breed . the first large - scale gene expression profiling study ( skin cdna microarrays )\nwas undertaken using resistant / susceptible adaptaur cattle and identified several candidate mechanisms ( e.g. antibody immune response day 1 of the infestation ) that were involved in adaptaur tick resistance ( wang et al .\n2007 ) . nevertheless , because complex response mechanisms to multiple and variable stressors are involved , the contribution of quantitative genetics and molecular biology for the improvement of b. taurus to a stressful tropical and/or semi - arid environment remains to be fully assessed . the completion of the bovine genome assembly ( the bovine genome sequencing and analysis consortium 2009 ) provides an opportunity to understand how cattle evolved and adapted to different geographical regions and production systems .\nthe biological systems most affected by changes in the number and organization of genes in the cattle lineage include reproduction , immunity , lactation and digestion , all of which are important to our discussion on tropical adaptation .\nthey concluded that these changes in the cattle lineage probably reflect metabolic , physiologic and immune adaptations due to microbial fermentation in the rumen , the environment and its influence on disease transmission , and the reproductive strategy of cattle .\nindeed , understanding the taurine evolutionary trajectories also provides an insight into the predictability of cattle performance in cattle industries of the 21st century .\nawareness of the taurine evolutionary trajectories in favourable environments will provide a guide to future breeding experiments .\nbreeding goals are enhanced by not only knowledge about the diseases associated with production and the stress they cause but also mechanisms of resistance to diseases .\nglobal warming , with elevated ambient temperatures , altered rainfall patterns and changed distributions of parasites and pathogens ( sutherst 2001 ; howden et al .\n2009 ) , will also impact livestock evolutionary trajectories ( burdon and thrall 2008 ) and provide new challenges for livestock producers . in the previous sections , we reviewed and discussed the evolutionary history and genetics of b. taurus cattle and the selection pressures imposed by different environments and/or production systems using tick resistance as a case study . in a systems framework\n, it is the interactions between genotype , environment and management that contribute to evolution of different genotypes .\ncompared to the tropically adapted b. taurus , the evolutionary history of temperate ( productivism ) b. taurus possess inheritantly higher levels of production potential , the production achieved in the absence of all environmental stress , and attributed to traits such as higher metabolic rates and appetites of the temperate taurine breeds .\nconversely , the evolution of b. taurus in environmentally stressful regions has ensured that those genotypes possess mechanisms of adaptation ( e.g. resistance to cattle tick ) unlike their temperate counterpart ( see hoffmann and parsons 1991 ) .\nhence , the metabolic rates of breeds such as charolais and angus would be higher than the tropically adapted breeds n'dama and criollo\n. however , in terms of adaptation to environmental stress the reverse is true and the n'dama and criollo possess relatively higher levels of environmental adaptation than breeds synonymous with productivism .\nhistorically in commercial livestock production systems environmental stress is alleviated with strategies such as parasite control and supplementary feeding .\nfigure 2 shows the g  e  m interactions in terms of relative production potential of temperate and tropical b. taurus ( g ) in the presence and absence of management ( m ) to negate the effect of increasing levels of environmental stress ( e ) .\nthe relative levels of production potential are shown on the vertical axis whilst the increasing levels of environmental stress are shown on the horizontal axis .\nthus , as the level of environmental stress increases , the decline in production of the tropically adapted b. taurus is substantially less than the decline of the temperate b. taurus but if there is intervention to remove environmental stress then the response on production by the temperate taurine breeds would be greater than the response by the tropically adapted taurine breeds ( fig .\nthis implies that the costs associated with maintaining high productivity in temperate b. taurus might negate the profit obtained via high production .\ndiagrammatic representation of the g  e  m for bos taurus adapted to a temperate environment ( e.g. angus ) and b. taurus adapted to a tropical environment ( e.g. n'dama ) showing the proportional decline from optimal production potential for growth when there is no intervention by management to alleviate increasing levels of tropical environmental stress .\nthe two shaded horizontal lines indicate the level of management required to maintain production potential .\nwe have specifically avoided discussing g  e  m interactions that exist within breed between animals at the level of genes which respond to different environments and/or different management interventions .\n( 2006a , b ) and are outside the scope of this study . in practice ,\nthe major hurdle to achieving economic sustainability will be the acknowledgement that no single genotype will outperform all other genotypes regardless of environmental conditions .\nmoreover , interactions between genotype and management ( e.g. use of acaricide to control cattle tick ) occur when performances of different genotypes are not equally affected by different management inputs .\nif n'dama and angus cattle are given the same dosage of acaricide in a region of tick infestation , angus cattle responds better to treatment than n'dama cattle ( response as in growth and fertility ) .\nif , however , n'dama and angus cattle are not given any treatment of acaricide in the same region , then n'dama cattle are likely to achieve higher production performance than angus cattle ( fig .\nthere is g  m. hence , a livestock system in essence is defined by the g  e  m interactions and understanding g  e  m and its impact on genetic , environmental and managerial strategies is crucial in future livestock systems .\nlivestock production in the 21st century will be characterized by systems where both market ( food and fibre output ) and nonmarket ( social , environmental and climate change ) issues are given consideration .\nthus , livestock producers will maintain their drive for maximization of output but with diminished reliance on industrialization and therapeutic agents to alleviate environmental stress and rely more on the genetic make - up of their animals to combat stress from heat , parasites , pathogens and poor nutrition .\nvarious evolutionary trajectories of b. taurus since domestication suggest that the environmentally adapted breeds , along with b. indicus breeds , will play a pivotal role in the transition to sustainable production systems . the review of work on such breeds as the n'dama , senepol , criollo and adaptaur implies that both natural and artificial selection should be incorporated into selection decisions \nonce there is an understanding of the beef and dairy production diseases and the mechanisms of resistance to environmental stress then , as with the plant industries , molecular biology technology may be successfully applied to cattle .\ncorresponding breeding objectives for both production and adaptation traits could also be established via a combination of well - established quantitative genetic methodologies with emerging molecular biology technologies such as functional genomics .\nwe also conclude that the four adapted taurine breeds noted above , along with breeds that have undergone similar evolutionary trajectories , would possess candidate genes that could contribute to improving the productivity of cattle in challenging environments .\nhowever , the physiological antagonism between production potential and adaptation ensures no genotype achieves highest performance in all environments .\nthe evolutionary history and knowledge of the genetic architecture will provide estimates of production potential ( in a favourable environment ) and level of resistance to environmental stress ( in an unfavourable environment ) and therefore estimates of how much production is realized when environmental stressors are controlled .\nhence , the performance of a breed or combination of breeds in a given environment or degree of intervention by management to alleviate environmental stressors , are able to be predicted .

pulmonary effects that may contribute to its severity.2 one of the systemic manifestations that affect these patients is related to cardiac autonomic modulation .\npatients with copd have changes in this modulation that play an important role in the morbidity and mortality of these patients.3 these changes result in reduced heart rate variability ( hrv ) , which provides a noninvasive measure to evaluate modulation of the autonomic nervous system,4 describing the oscillations between consecutive heart beats ( rr intervals),5 and its application in clinical practice has increased considerably.6 muscle sympathetic nerve activity is higher in copd patients compared with healthy individuals.7,8 there is evidence of enhanced sympathetic nerve traffic , elevated catecholamines , and an activated renin - angiotensin system in these individuals.8,9 hrv has been investigated in several pathological conditions such as hypertension,10 myocardial infarction,11 coronary artery disease,12,13 diabetes,14 stroke,15 and obstructive sleep apnea.16 it is known that decreased hrv is considered an independent risk factor for mortality in healthy people , especially after acute myocardial infarction and is related to adrenergic hyperactivity and decreased parasympathetic activity.4,11,17 furthermore , hrv has also been used to investigate physiological changes such as those associated with the execution of exercise.6 exercise promotes important changes in the functioning of the cardiovascular system and its autonomic adjustment mechanisms.1821 in healthy subjects , performing exercise has been associated with decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic modulation22 and , after its performance , the cardiac sympathetic modulation remains increased and the parasympathetic reduced.23,24 in copd patients undergoing exercise , cardiac autonomic modulation has been scarcely studied , especially in the post - exercise period .\nunderstanding these responses may have significant clinical importance in these patients.1 regarding physical exercises in copd patients , resistance exercise ( re ) has been considered an important component in pulmonary rehabilitation25 since these patients have skeletal muscle dysfunction that is associated with limited exercise tolerance , fatigue , and dyspnea26 which are considered negative prognostic factors in copd.27 therefore , considering that hrv has proven to be a clinically valuable tool for evaluation of neurological control of the heart , the scarcity of information regarding cardiac autonomic modulation in the post - exercise period , and considering that physiotherapy utilizes exercise programs as part of copd patient treatment , the aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac autonomic modulation through hrv after an acute session of re at different intensities in copd patients .\nwe hypothesize that the execution of an acute session of re in copd patients modifies autonomic modulation after its completion , and that these responses are dependent on the intensity of the exercise performed .\nit is hoped that this study will contribute relevant information about the impact of re on the autonomic modulation of copd patients .\nfor the realization of this study , data from 12 copd patients were analyzed . to participate in the study the patients had to have undergone spirometry and received a medical diagnosis of the disease , as recommended by the global initiative for obstructive lung disease,1 and not have the following characteristics : smoking , home oxygen therapy use , participation in another physical training program prior to this study , reported presence of heart co -

up before the test and for its realization an initial workload of 20% of body weight for lower , and 5% of body weight for upper limbs was set . for the determination of 1rm , subjects had three to five attempts at intervals ranging between 3 to 5 minutes ( min ) .\nthe test was completed when the patient reached the load that caused mechanical failure of execution , and the final load at which they managed to perform the exercise without mechanical failure was established as a maximum load .\nall tests were supervised by the same evaluator.30 the movements tested to determine the 1rm and , thereafter , were : knee flexion , knee extension , shoulder flexion , shoulder abduction , and elbow flexion .\nthe re series was performed for 50 min on weight training equipment ( ipiranga pulley system ; hard academy , so paulo , brazil ) regulated in accordance with the proper positioning of the patient for the correct execution of the exercises .\nthe movements during the exercises were : knee flexion , knee extension , shoulder flexion , shoulder abduction , and elbow flexion .\nthree series of ten repetitions of each exercise , with intervals of 1 min of rest between each series , at both intensities of 60% and 90% of 1rm were performed .\nthe implementation of protocols of 60% and 90% was performed randomly and with an interval of 48 hours . to control , blood pressure , heart rate ( hr ) , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , and degree of dyspnea were noted before and after exercise . for the hrv analysis ,\npatients hr was recorded beat - by - beat using a polar s810i hr monitor ( polar electro , kempele , finland ) , a previously validated device for capturing the beat - to - beat hr and its utilization for hrv analysis.31,32 after the explanation of the data collection procedures , an elastic catchment strap was placed on the chest of the volunteer , at the height of the xiphoid process , and the hr receiver was attached to their wrist .\ninitially , an hr reading for each patient was taken in the sitting position for 20 min and another after realization of the re .\nthe hrv assessment was performed on 2 separate days , one day at 60% and another at 90% of 1rm intensity for each exercise . for hrv indexes analysis ,\n256 consecutive rr intervals were selected for each time the hrv assessed , 5 minutes more stable from tracings , which were subjected to digital filtering by polar precision performance sw software ( version 4.01.029 ) supplemented by manual filtering to eliminate ectopic premature beats and artifacts , and only series with more than 95% sinus beats were included in the study.21,22,33 kubios software version 2.0 ( mathworks , natick , ma , usa)34 was used to calculate hrv indexes in the time and frequency domains .\nthe calculated indexes in the time domain were the following : standard deviation of normal to normal rr intervals ( sdnn [ ms ] ) and root mean square of differences between adjacent normal rr intervals in a time interval ( rmssd [ ms]).22,35 for hrv analysis in the frequency domain , we used the spectral components of low frequency ( lf : 0.04 to 0.15 hz ) and high frequency ( hf : 0.15 to 0.4 hz ) frequency , in normalized units and milliseconds , in addition to the lf / hf ratio.4,22,35 the hrv indexes were measured at the following times : baseline / rest , immediately after sessions , and at 5 , 10 , and 15 min after . for the population profile data analysis , a descriptive statistical method was used and the results were presented with mean , standard deviations , and minimum and maximum values .\ncomparisons of hrv indices among protocols ( 60% and 90% of 1rm ) and moments ( baseline , immediately after , 5 , 10 , and 15 min after ) were made by the technique of two -

exercise recovery period.23,24,40 in addition , there are no studies that evaluate autonomic modulation during recovery in patients with copd undergoing res and the influence of exercise intensity in this response . the sdnn index , which reflects the overall variability , displayed a significant increase in moments of recovery compared to baseline . during the recovery from exercise period ,\nthe initial return of hr to baseline occurs primarily due to parasympathetic reactivation.41,42 with the cessation of exercise , there is a loss of central command , and the baroreflex activation and other mechanisms contribute to the increase in parasympathetic activity.42,43 this parasympathetic reactivation promotes an increase in rr intervals variation , which may be associated with sdnn index increase .\nincreased sympathetic activity after re has been described in the literature.44 a study by lima et al , that evaluated the acute effects of strength exercise on hrv in young people , showed that when they performed the session with 70% of 1rm there was an increase in the lf index in the recovery period compared to pre - intervention.24 these findings corroborate the present study , since the lf ( ms ) index remained raised after re at both 60% and 90% of 1rm intensities . regarding the parasympathetic component in the recovery period of re , heffernan et\nal showed that 25 min after the cessation of exercise , the hr index remained reduced in healthy subjects.23 the same happened in the oliveira et al study , in which hrv was assessed immediately after the cessation of exercise in healthy men who underwent 12 months of re.44 the data from this study do not confirm these findings since the hf ( ms ) index remained raised throughout the period of recovery from exercise at both 60% and 90% of 1rm in copd patients .\na study by javorka et al,42 which evaluated hrv in healthy men after the step test , which assesses functional capacity , showed a marked reduction in the hf index during exercise and an increase during recovery , indicating parasympathetic reactivation after exercise .\nthe authors also found a gradual increase in the lf index during recovery and suggest that the lf index is directly influenced by changes in parasympathetic activity , through changes in vagal activity that cause fluctuations in the lf band , or indirectly , by changes in baroreflex sensitivity .\nusing hrv , gonzalez - camarena et al45 demonstrated that unlike the parasympathetic withdrawal seen during dynamic exercise , there may be an increase in vagal modulation during static exercise ( resistance ) without any change in lf / hf .\nthus it is possible that modulation in the neuronal sinoatrial node after re may also be different.23 the lf / hf ratio has been shown to increase from 20 to 30 min after exercise and may remain elevated for up to 60 min post - exercise,23,45,46 suggesting a state of sympathetic predominance.47,48 in the present study , although there was no statistical difference in lf / hf ratio between the periods evaluated , we observed an increase in this index both at 60% and 90% of 1rm after re compared to baseline .\nthe results also showed that regardless of the intensity of the exercises performed , autonomic modulation recovery is similar , indicating that the autonomic response after re at 60% of 1rm is the same as at 90% of 1rm in these patients . using diastolic blood pressure , gurjo et al49 showed that in normotensive women different intensities of re did not influence this parameter .\ncopd patients have autonomic dysfunction that promotes reduced hrv compared with healthy subjects.7,50,51 this autonomic dysfunction may , at least in part , explain the absence of differences in the autonomic modulation recovery after re performed with intensity equivalent to 60% and 90% of 1rm .\nthis study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration . the absence of a healthy control group should be mentioned , which could have helped determine whether the responses obtained from copd patients suffer any influence from the autonomic dysfunction presented by these patients .\nanother limitation is related to the impossibility of hrv analysis during the performance of the re series , which could provide important information for understanding the changes in autonomic modulation during the recovery period . during the performance of the re series , rest intervals of 1 min between each repetition\nadditionally , while capturing hr , the patients respiratory rate was not controlled , which may have influenced the hf index . considering the importance of the theme presented ,\nother studies are being conducted to evaluate the acute responses to resistance and aerobic exercise after physical training programs .\nfurthermore , research into the impact of different physical training protocols on autonomic modulation and clinical , biochemical , and functional variables in these individuals is being conducted .\nstudies of this nature can enrich knowledge in the area of exercise physiology in patients with copd . given the importance of understanding the autonomic behavior after re in copd patients , who suffer from autonomic dysfunction , which is considered a risk factor associated with mortality , this study represents a useful clinical tool for professionals in the area since the results indicate that hrv indexes , a noninvasive and inexpensive measurement , can aid both in evaluating the clinical manifestations of the disease and monitoring therapeutic procedures performed with these patients .\nfurthermore , there is no evidence of the impact of post - exercise autonomic modulation on mortality in copd and others diseases .\nfrom the results obtained from this study , it is concluded that acute sessions of re impact on autonomic modulation in copd patients by promoting differences in the recovery period compared to baseline ."}
{"id": 79, "text": "there are numerous reports of tissue volume increase in human1,2 and animal ( rodents , bovines , swine , etc.)3 - 5 tissues , and in cell cultures.6,7 however , such increases have never been observed in any other adipose flaps.8,9   the omentum is composed of highly vascularized fatty connective tissue ; it is approximately 2535  cm long , its volume varies according to the size of the patient but it is not always predictable.10 the use of the omentum for various purposes has been reported,8 - 14 because of its peculiar structure , its rich vascular supply that enables its high capacity of absorption , its pronounced angiogenic activity that supports local ( and ischemic ) tissues , its innate immune function , its ability to adhere to local structures and its high concentration of  tissue factors  that promote hemostasia.8,11 - 14 it may promote angiogenic activity in structures adjacent to where it is applied to in animals15 and in human beings.11   the omentum is predominantly composed of mature adipocytes that do not multiply and that represent an important share of visceral fat in the human body .\nit contains adult stem cells and progenitor cells or preadipocytes , which are smaller and able to differentiate.16 adipocytes are now seen as energy storage cells as well as cell with endocrine function.17 the observation that they secrete leptin established that adipose tissue is an endocrine organ communicating with the central nervous system.18 hypoxic adipocytes express more angiogenic factors , suggesting that hypoxia might be one of the modulators of the angiogenic process.19 - 21   zhang et al in 1997 , suggested that the vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) is probably the main angiogenic factor produced by the omentum.3 increased vegf expression by hypoxic omentum cells may be responsible for increased omentum angiogenic activity under ischemic conditions through paracrine regulation .\nthe trauma of surgically transplanted omentum induces increased vegf expression , similar to that induced by hypoxia.3,5   adipose tissue growth can be controlled by local vascularization .\nadipocyte development and vascular morphology are dependent on triglyceride deposit whereas adipocyte size does not depend on storage volume.5 increased triglyceride induces preadipocytes to become mature adipocytes with consequent hypertrophy and hyperplasia .\nthe increase in the bulk of adipocytes is accompanied by an increase in the microvascular network22 and , conversely , neovascularization accompanies adipose tissue growth .\nevidence suggests that the o2sensitive signaling mechanism regulates adipogenesis.19 however , preadipocyte differentiation is inhibited by hypoxia leading to adipocyte hypertrophy without hyperplasia.23   measurement of vegf , neoangiogenesis by the cd31 ( cluster of differentiation molecule ) or pecam1 ( platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule ) together with morphometric measurements of the adipocyte represent adequate means to investigate , clarify , and document the increase in postoperative volume of the omentum flap.24 - 26   in this project we used laparoscopically harvested omentum flaps to treat breast deformities , with a significant volume increase of the omentum over the first months following its transposition .\nour main purpose here was to establish whether the volume increase of the omentum flap transposed to the breast region is caused by adipocyte hypertrophy or hyperplasia .\ndocumentation of the direct effect of neoangiogenesis

results indicate an increase in cell volume ( figure 7a and b ) which was consistent when three different measurements were obtained : perimeter , area , and diameter of adipocytes .\nmoreover , the increase in the number of vessels in the second sample ( figure 7c and d ) suggests neoangiogenesis stimulated by the initial increase in vegf values , as documented in the first sample .\nlaparoscopycally harvested omentum flaps were used to treat breast deformities , with significant volume increases , which , to the best of our knowledge has never been reported in any other adipose flap .\nthis volume increase was observed in all of the patients during the first 3 to 5 months following transposition . at the moment of the transposition of the omentum flap to the region of the breast ,\nthe adipose tissue was submitted to a transitory hypoxia , which might conceivably have stimulated vegf and , consequently , neoangiogenesis , leading to the overall increase of the flap volume .\nthis increase might be attributed to cell proliferation ( adipocyte hyperplasia ) or to increased cell size ( adipocyte hypertrophy ) .\nit is very probable that the high initial vegf was responsible for the observed effect , by inducing increased vascularization or neoangiogenesis ; this was confirmed by the increased number of vessels per field in the second sample , similar to what was reported in rabbits by zhong et al.22 in zhong 's study the new vessels disappeared after three months of observation .\nwe have observed a maintained increase in vessel density nearly a year after omentum transposition ; this however can not be explained by the hypoxia , which was only temporary during the perioperative tempo .\nno explanation can be offered for this maintained neovascularization , nor for for the increased omentum volume in all of these patients .\nthe analysis of vegf variation between the samples is marred by a confounding factor , namely the lack of significance of the reduction of values between surgery 1 and 2 .\nthe difference in time intervals between the first and second surgeries ( 74 to 320 days ) and the age heterogeneity of the patients ( 20 to 60 years ) in this study , may be prima facie interpreted as a limitation of the research ; however , it turned out to be of particular interest for making it possible to highlight the consistency of the supposed effect of vegf stimulation , resulting in neoangiogenesis and hypertrophy of the adipocytes in all the patients .\naccording to the bradford hill criteria , the important diversity of ages among patients along with the interval between the two procedures reinforces the consistency of the effect of this study because , in spite of the individual procedural variations , the same effect occurred.27   in this study , evidence showed the extend to which changes in the tissue microenvironment , by temporary hypoxia produced by the mobilization of the omentum flap , are able to produce a cellular response , which in this case is neoangiogenesis and adipocyte hypertrophy .\nthis study was carried out based on the clinical observation of the increase in the volume of the omentum flap which occurred as a spontaneous postoperative evolution , a phenomenon never before induced \nit was probably caused by adipocyte hypertrophy resulting from neoangiogenesis , induced by increased vegf resulting from temporary hypoxia .\ncomplementary studies are needed to investigate why neovascularization and omentum volume is maintained for a long time after the triggering factor stops , a response unlike what happens in other adipose tissues .\nconflict of interest disclosure : none of the authors had any financial or personal conflict of interest ."}
{"id": 80, "text": "rising prevalence of food hypersensitivity and severe allergic reactions to foods have been reported , but the data are scarce . it is stressed that more data are needed regarding patient groups at risk for food hypersensitivity and symptoms and foods responsible for these reactions .\natopic dermatitis is a chronic , intermittent , inflammatory , genetically predisposed skin disease characterized by severe pruritus and xerosis .\nthis disease is one of the earliest manifestations of atopy with the highest incidence during the first 3 months of life , and constitutes , together with allergic rhinitis and asthma bronchiale , the triad of atopic diseases .\nthe prevalence of atopic dermatitis is about 10 - 20% in children and 1 - 3% in adults .\nthe presence of atopic disorders implies an increased risk of food allergy representing only a small percentage of all food hypersensitivity reactions .\nthe term food allergy is used to describe clinical symptoms that are mediated by the immune system while non - allergic food hypersensitivity describes those which are not .\nthe term food hypersensitivity represents the umbrella term for both reaction patterns . according to some studies ,\nfood - induced hypersensitivity symptoms are far more frequently perceived ( 20 - 30% ) than recognized by the medical profession .\nin the period from january 2008 to january 2012 , 228 patients suffering from atopic dermatitis in age 14 years or older , were examined - 72 men , 156 women , average age 26.2 ( sd 9.5 ) years , average scorad ( scoring index of atopic dermatitis affected skin area , intensity criteria and subjective parameters ) 32.9 points ( sd 14.1 ) at the department of dermatology and venereology .\nthe complete dermatological examination was performed and these patients were personally asked to describe all their food hypersensitivity reactions .\nthe patients answered if they suffered from immediate or late food hypersensitivity including oral allergy syndrome , gastrointestinal problems , the occurrence of skin problems , and respiratory problems .\nthe most frequent food allergens were mentioned and patients answered if they had a suspicion of food hypersensitivity , and other foods they suspected a having potential to cause hypersensitivity .\nthe answers concerning the possible food hypersensitivity reactions reflect the patient 's history and were not based on the results of examinations such as specific ige , skin prick tests , or challenge tests .\nthe results of examinations with the patient 's answers were collected and processed by the dermatologist .\na total of 228 patients were examined , 76 men , and 156 women with the average age 26.2 years ( sd 9.5 years ) and with the average scorad 32.9 sd 14.1 points .\na total of 196 patients ( 86% ) from 228 described the food hypersensitivity reactions , no reactions were recorded in 32 patients ( 14% ) .\ncharacteristic of patients the food hypersensitivity reactions are recorded after the ingestion of nuts in 79 patients ( 35% ) , tomatoes in 47 patients ( 20% ) , kiwi in 40 patients ( 17% ) , apples in 38 patients ( 16% ) , spices in 38 patients ( 16% ) , tangerines in 35 patients ( 15% ) , oranges in 35 patients ( 15% ) , capsidum in 30 patients ( 13% ) , fish in 27 patients ( 12% ) , celery in 20 patients ( 9% ) , chocolate in 15 patients ( 7% ) , carrots in 13 patients ( 6% ) , sesame seeds in 10 patients ( 4% ) , milk in nine patients , almond in nine patients and cherry in nine patients ( 3.9% ) , of honey in eight patients and strawberry in eight patients ( 3,5% ) , after ingestion of potatoes in seven and wine in seven patients ( 6% ) , after ingestion of apricots in six patients , garlic in six patients , poppy - seeds in six patients , cacao in six patients , pine - apple in six patients , banana in six patients and egg in six patients ( 2.6% ) , after ingestion of gherkin in three patients , cucumber in three patients , flavored soda water in three patients , pear in three patients , pulses in three patients and beer in three patients ( 1.3% ) , after ingestion of chees in two patients , beef in two patients , gooseberry in two patients , currants in two patients , melon in two patients , spinach in two patients , plum in two patients , rice in two patients , kohlrabi in two patients , ketchup in two patients , mustard in two patients ( 1% ) and after ingestion of parsley , chamomile , caulifower , cafe , chicken , sausages , rye flour in one patient each ( 0.4% ) for every one of the aforementioned items ( 0.4% ) .\nmost subjects reported reactions to a single food ( 47 patients , 20% ) , to two foods by 40 patients ( 17.5% ) , to three foods by 44 patients ( 19% ) , to four foods by 19 patients ( 8% ) , to five foods by 16 patients ( 7% ) , to six foods by 19 patients ( 8% ) , and to seven foods by 11 patients ( 5% ) .\nthese symptoms of food hypersensitivity were mentioned : oral allergy syndrome in 142 patients ( 62% ) , pruritus in 98 patients ( 42% ) , worsening of atopic dermatitis in 65 patients ( 28% ) , urticaria in 20 patients ( 9% ) , gastrointestinal symptoms in 25 patients ( 11% ) , rhinitis in 21 patients ( 9% ) , respiratory problems in 10 patients ( 4% ) , and contact allergic reaction in 10 patients ( 4% )  table 2 .\nthe study group represents patients suffering from atopic dermatitis older than 14 years of age .\nthe food hypersensitivity reactions were recorded in 86% of patients , the majority of them as the early reactions and these reactions have a high diagnostic importance because the early symptoms after ingestion have a clear diagnostic connection with the ingested foods .\nthe majority of these patients eliminated these foods but they recorded that after a casual ingestion the reactions were reproducible .\nmost frequent food hypersensitivity reactions were described after the ingestion of nuts and especially after peanuts with the symptom of oral allergy syndrome .\npeanut allergy represents an increasing problem , involving approximately one in 150 - 200 subjects .\nthe mean age at detection is decreasing and even 2 - 3-year - old children are being affected . a typical at - risk subject is an atopic individual with heightened risk for atopic dermatitis and/or other food allergies .\ntomatoes were mentioned as a cause of oral allergy syndrome and pruritus in 47 patients ( 20% ) .\nthere is an increasing consumption of tomatoes worldwide : fresh in salads , cooked in household sauces , or industrially processed .\nalthough , many tomato allergens have been identified , there is no information in the literature on the allergenic components found in commercial tomato products . in fresh\nindustrial tomato derivatives still contain ltp , thus presenting a problem for lipid transfer protein allergic patients .\nfruits ( in particular acidic fruits such as kiwi , oranges , or lemons ) were frequently mentioned as causing symptoms of oral allergy syndrome , pruritus , worsening of eczema or gastrointestinal reaction . in patients allergic to fruit ,\nmultiple sensitizations to other vegetable products , whether from the same family or taxonomically unrelated , are frequent , although they do not always share the same clinical expression . furthermore , more than 75% of these patients are allergic to pollen , the type of pollen varying in relation to the aerobiology of the area .\nthe basis of these associations among vegetable foods and with pollens lies in the existence of ige antibodies against  panallergens ,  which determines cross - reactivity .\npanallergens are proteins that are spread throughout the vegetable kingdom and are implicated in important biological functions ( generally defense ) and consequently their sequences and structures are highly conserved .\nthe three best - known groups are allergens homologous to bet v 1 , profilins , and ltp\n. allergens homologous to bet v 1 ( major birch pollen allergen ) constitute a group of defense proteins ( pr-10 ) , with a molecular weight of 17 kda , which behave as major allergens in patients from northern and central europe with allergy to vegetables associated with birch pollen allergy . in these patients\n, the primary sensitization seems to be produced through the inhalation route on exposure to birch pollen .\nthe symptomatology characteristically associated with sensitization to this family of allergens is oral allergy syndrome .\nprofilins are highly conserved proteins in eukaryotic organisms and are present in pollen and a wide variety of vegetable foods .\nthey have a molecular weight of 14 kda and present a high degree of structural homology as well as marked cross - reactivity among one another .\nthe presence of anti - profilin ige broadens the spectrum of sensitizations to vegetable foods detected through skin tests and/or in vitro tests but it is unclear whether it is connected with the clinical expression of food allergy .\nfood hypersensitivity reactions are generally divided on a basis of the underlying pathophysiologic changes that produce the reaction as ( 1 ) food allergy , ( 2 ) food intolerance , ( 3 ) pharmacologic reactions , ( 4 ) food poisoning , and ( 5 ) toxic reactions .\nalthough , food hypersensitivity reactions are common , food allergy represents only a small percentage of all these reactions ; only 2 - 4% of these reactions can be attributed to reproducible , immunoglobulin e - mediated food allergy .\naccording to sicherer , food allergy , defined as an adverse immune response to food proteins , affects as many as 6% of young children and 3 - 4% of adults in westernized countries and the prevalence appears to be rising .\nthe importance of food allergy in children with atopic dermatitis was confirmed by extensive studies .\nthe role of food allergy remains controversial and underestimated in older children and adult patients suffering from atopic dermatitis .\nthis study was carried out on all patients with food related symptoms attending a cutaneous allergy clinic .\nit was shown that while the reported prevalence of food allergy in adult patients with atopic dermatitis is low ( 10% ) , more than half of these will show immunological evidence of a food allergy which support the clinical history .\nimmediate symptoms were usual with nuts and tomatoes as the major allergens . according to mattila food hypersensitivity\nis commonly suspected , especially among adults with atopic diseases . in the study of mattila\n, 286 finnish university students were examined ; 87 of them without clinically confirmed atopic disease , the rest suffered with atopic dermatitis / or other atopic diseases .\na thorough clinical examination was performed with a questionnaire specifying adverse events to foods . in the study by mattila food hypersensitivity\nwere recorded in 172 subjects ( 60% ) , most frequently among subjects with atopic dermatitis and other atopic diseases .\nthe authors stressed that , more data are needed regarding patient groups at risk for food hypersensitivity and symptoms and foods responsible for the reactions .\nthe roehr 's study presents the data of the pediatric group ( 0 - 17 years ) of a representative , randomly sampled , cross - sectional population  based survey studying 13,300 inhabitants of berlin regarding food - related symptoms .\nthey concluded that the perception of food related - symptoms is common among children and adolescents from the general population .\nself - report could be confirmed in around 1 of 10 individuals , still resulting in 4.2% of proven clinical symptoms .\nhowever , most reactions were mild and mainly because of pollen - associated food allergy while non - allergic food hypersensitivity reactions were less common .\nsevere ige - mediated food allergy was observed in individuals with pre - existing atopic disease . according to the results of osterballe rising prevalence of food hypersensitivity and severe allergic reactions to foods\nthis study estimated the prevalence of food hypersensitivity to the most common allergenic foods in an unselected population of young adults .\nthey investigated a cohort of 1272 young adults 22 years of age by a questionnaire , skin prick test , and histamine release followed by oral challenge to the most common allergenic foods .\nfood hypersensitivity was divided into primary and secondary , primary food hypersensitivity was defined as being independent of pollen sensitization whereas the secondary one was defined as a reaction to pollen related fruits and vegetables in pollen allergic patients .\nthe primary food hypersensitivity was reported by 19.6% and the secondary one by 16.7% of the participants . confirmed primary food hypersensitivity by oral challenge was 1.7% . in primary food hypersensitivity ,\nthe most common allergenic food was peanuts ( 0.6% ) followed by additives ( 0.5% ) , shrimps ( 0.2% ) , codfish ( 0.1% ) , cow 's milk ( 0.1% ) , octopus ( 0.1% ) , and soy ( 0.1% ) .\nin secondary food hypersensitivity , kiwi allergy was reported by 7.8% of the participants followed by hazelnut ( 6.6% ) , pineapple ( 4.4% ) , apple ( 4.3% ) , orange ( 4.2% ) , tomato ( 3.8% ) , peach ( 3.0% ) , and nuts ( 2.7% ) .\nthe aim of another osterballe study was to estimate the prevalence of food hypersensitivity to the most common allergenic foods in an unselected population of children and adults . in total ,\nthe prevalence of food hypersensitivity confirmed by oral challenge was 2.3% in children at 3 years of age , 1% in children\nthe most common allergenic foods were hen 's egg affecting 1.6% of the children 3 years old of age and peanuts in 0.4% of the adults .\nof the adults , 0.2% was allergic to codfish , and 0.3% to shrimp whereas no challenges with codfish and shrimp were positive in children .\nthe prevalence of clinical reactions to pollen - related foods in pollen - sensitized adults was estimated to be 32% . according to the kanny 's study\nthey performed an epidemiologic survey in france to determine the prevalence , clinical pictures , allergens , and risk factors of food allergy .\nthis study was conducted on 33,110 persons who answered a questionnaire addressed to a representative sample of the french population .\nthe most frequent allergens were 9% vegetables , 8% milk , 8% crustaceans , 5% fruit cross - reacting with latex , 4% egg , 3% tree nuts , and 1% peanut .\nsensitization to pollen was significantly correlated with angioedema , asthma , rhinitis , and fruit allergy .\nthe main manifestations of food allergy were atopic dermatitis in subjects under 6 years of age , asthma in subjects between 4 years and 6 years of age , and anaphylactic shock in adults over 30 years of age . according to roehre , it is well known , that objective clinical symptoms can be reproduced in only a small proportion of subjective reports , probably because of a strong tendency of individuals to casually relate situations of the daily life with ingested foods . on the other hand , these recorded early symptoms at our study were reproducible and clearly described ( oral allergy syndrome , urticaria , breathlessness , anaphylaxis , some gastrointestinal symptoms such as crapms ) . according to godse and\ncol acute urticaria is more common in young adults and children and most often is caused by allergic reactions to foods .\nsometimes patients seek confirmatory testing from a physician about a suspected food or drug trigger .\nsymptoms such as pruritus and worsening of atopic dermatitis do not always have a connection to ingested foods but patients may relate them to foods .\nretrospective analyses by niggeman and breuer have shown that the patient 's history of food related atopic dermatitis does not have a high diagnostic importance .\nhowever , according to the indian study , selected patients were advised to strictly adhere to a diet excluding milk and milk products , all kinds of nuts and nut - containing foods , egg , and egg - containing foods , sea fish and prawns , brinjal and soyabean for a period of 3 weeks . instead of these avoided items ,\nthe food items were dal and dal products , rohu fish , chicken , and fruits .\nthere was a statistically significant reduction in severity scores after dietary elimination alone . according to our results ,\nfood hypersensitivity reactions are common in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis and should not be underestimated .\npatients with these reactions should be examined for evaluations , if they suffer from food allergy , food intolerance or from other kind of food hypersensitivity reactions .\nthese patients describe food hypersensitivity mostly after ingestion of nuts ( 35% of patients ) , with the oral allergy syndrome .\nsuspected rising prevalence of food hypersensitivity in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis was confirmed in our study ; the food hypersensitivity reactions \n were recorded in 86% of these patients .\nfoods with the most often recorded reactions are nuts , kiwi , tomatoes , and citruses ."}
{"id": 81, "text": "previous reports have identified noninfectious uveitis as a potential sequela following both intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections .\nwe present two unique cases of acute anterior uveitis following intravitreal bevacizumab that did not occur with subsequent ranibizumab injections .\nthese cases may reflect differences in the etiology of anterior uveitis following intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab . given these differences , it may be reasonable to offer ranibizumab to patients who have experienced presumed bevacizumab - induced anterior uveitis .\nstudies monitoring the safety of intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections have identified noninfectious acute anterior uveitis as a sequela of both drugs.1,2 although a large retrospective case series failed to detect a significant difference in the incidence of anterior uveitis after either bevacizumab or ranibizumab,3 randomized prospective trials evaluating this complication are lacking.4 we present two cases of acute anterior uveitis following intravitreal bevacizumab that did not recur with subsequent ranibizumab therapy .\nuniquely , the first case describes the risk of continued intravitreal bevacizumab following presumed bevacizumab - related acute anterior uveitis , and the second presents a case of unilateral acute anterior uveitis in a patient who had received long - term bilateral intravitreal bevacizumab injections .\na 75-year - old woman with a history of hypothyroidism received two doses of bevacizumab 8 weeks apart for exudative age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) in the right eye .\nfive days after the second injection , the patient reported tearing , light sensitivity , and decreased vision .\nslit lamp biomicroscopy revealed 1 + conjunctival vascular injection , 1 + corneal edema with intact epithelium , and 1 + flare .\na diagnosis of  decompensated corneal dystrophy was made and sodium chloride hypertonicity ophthalmic ointment 5% ( muro-128 , bausch and lomb , rochester , ny ) and prednisolone acetate 1% were initiated .\nthe visual acuity and ocular findings reportedly returned to baseline within 1 week . on initial presentation at our center 4 months later , the best corrected visual acuity was 20/30 .\nslit lamp biomicroscopy revealed anterior basement membrane dystrophy but no other corneal pathology or intraocular inflammation .\ndilated fundoscopic examination revealed asteroid hyalosis and a serous pigment epithelial detachment without subretinal fluid or hemorrhage .\ntwo months later , the visual acuity dropped to 20/70 , and the pigment epithelial detachment increased in height on optical coherence tomography ( oct ) .\nthe patient underwent a series of 3-monthly intravitreal ranibizumab ( 0.5 mg/0.05 ml ) injections without incident , consistent with reports in the literature supporting the use of anti - vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) therapy to treat amd - associated serous pigment epithelial detachments.5,6 the visual acuity subsequently improved to 20/40 with marked resolution of the pigment epithelial detachment on oct .\ndue to patient preference and the diagnostic ambiguity of the original event , maintenance therapy was initiated with a retrial of bevacizumab .\ntwelve days later , the patient noted tearing , light sensitivity , and pain in the eye .\nslit lamp biomicroscopy revealed 2 + conjunctival vascular injection , corneal edema , and 2 + cell and flare .\nthe patient was treated with topical prednisolone acetate 1% and homatropine 5% for acute anterior uveitis , and the symptoms resolved completely within 4 weeks .\na 69-year - old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and primary open - angle glaucoma received a diagnosis of bilateral exudative amd after reporting a 6-week history of decreased vision .\nhe was initially treated with monthly ranibizumab injections ( two in each eye ) before switching to bevacizumab .\nhe continued to receive intravitreal bevacizumab injections in each eye every 8 weeks for the next 2 years without complication .\nfour days after a routine bevacizumab injection in the left eye , he noticed increasing redness and foreign body sensation .\nthe visual acuity dropped from 20/25 to 20/40 and slit lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates with trace cell in the anterior chamber .\nhe subsequently received intravitreal ranibizumab injections in each eye every 6 weeks , and tolerated the therapy well with no evidence of recurrent uveitis .\nthe anti - vegf agents , bevacizumab and ranibizumab , have enhanced the management of exudative amd.2 however , the safety profile of these drugs continues to undergo scrutiny , and noninfectious intraocular inflammation is a known adverse effect of both drugs.1 a retrospective case series of nearly 2000 injections reported no significant difference between the incidence of post - injection anterior uveitis ( 1.57% bevacizumab vs 1.38% ranibizumab ; p > 0.80 ) or panuveitis ( 0.39% vs 0.41% ; p = 1.0).3 however , randomized prospective trials comparing the rates of uveitis between ranibizumab and bevacizumab are lacking , leading some authors to question whether the complication rates are truly similar.4,7 although underpowered to compare this relatively rare outcome , the 1-year clinical trial results from the comparison of age - related macular degeneration treatment trials reported anterior uveitis in < 1% of study eyes receiving either treatment.8 in retrospect , we believe that the first case was bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis that was originally misdiagnosed .\namd treatment later resumed uneventfully with ranibizumab and was then switched to bevacizumab for maintenance therapy .\nthe anterior uveitis promptly relapsed . to our knowledge , this is the first report in the literature to describe recurrent bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis following a retrial of intravitreal bevacizumab .\nthe second patient likely experienced bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis after previously tolerating the medication without difficulty , which has been reported.9 his case is unique in that he was receiving bilateral bevacizumab injections , yet developed only unilateral anterior uveitis .\nboth cases corroborate reports from raja et al10 and georgopoulos et al14 describing the safe administration of intravitreal ranibizumab after bevacizumab - related uveitis .\nthe etiology of this drug - induced uveitis is speculative at best , since it occurs rarely and there is no histopathologic data with which to correlate the phenomenon .\nthe following mechanisms have been proposed : ( 1 ) toxic response to the drug or excipients ; ( 2 ) direct blood - aqueous or blood - retinal barrier compromise by drug or excipients ; ( 3 ) immune response to the drug or excipients ; and ( 4 ) rebound inflammation secondary to vegf suppression.11 the excipients of both preparations are nearly identical : trehalose dihydrate , sodium phosphate , polysorbate 20 , and sterile water ( histidine hydrochloride  in ranibizumab only ) , which makes it more difficult to implicate them in a differential immune response\n. moreover , there are no reported cases of hypersensitivity to any of these excipients in the literature .\nalternatively , this reaction may occur as an immunologic response to the fc protein portion of the full - length antibody molecule itself ; ranibizumab is an fab fragment whereas bevacizumab is a full - length antibody ( fab and fc ) derived from the same parent molecule .\nthis is an attractive explanation since other drugs , such as heparin , provoke a differential immune response based on antigenic load .\nunfractionated heparin has a higher propensity to cause heparin - induced - thrombocytopenia than low - molecular weight heparin , presumably due to the larger size of the full heparin molecule and its enhanced ability to form immunogenic complexes with other platelet factors.12 the exact immunologic mechanism underlying these cases of uveitis is difficult to ascertain without histopathologic data , though a delayed - type hypersensitivity reaction seems possible given the several - day lapse in time between exposure to bevacizumab and the onset of uveitis symptoms .\ninterestingly , reports in the cancer literature show that infusions of monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab cause immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the majority of cases , though delayed - type reactions can be seen in up to 30% of patients.13 aside from the obvious difference in molecular size between ranibizumab and bevacizumab , it is also possible that differences in drug production could explain the variation in immunogenicity.14 bevacizumab is harvested as a glycosylated product of human ovarian cancer cells , whereas ranibizumab is a non - glycosylated product of bacterial metabolism .\nthe glycosylation of bevacizumab creates more potential immunogenic sites compared to the non - glycosylated ranibizumab , which could translate into a higher propensity for bevacizumab to cause inflammatory reactions .\nfurthermore , it is interesting to speculate on how the variable dosing regimens for bevacizumab and ranibizumab may contribute to the development of inflammatory complications .\nthe predominant anti - vegf dosing schedules used for amd treatment include fixed monthly injections ,  treat and extend , and as - needed ( pro re nata [ prn ] ) injections based on symptoms and oct findings .\nwe could not find anything in the literature to suggest that one dosing regimen may result in more complications than another , though it would seem reasonable to postulate that more frequent exposure to a drug could result in a higher likelihood of it causing inflammatory/ immunogenic complications .\ndata from the second year of the comparison of age - related macular degeneration treatment trial may help to more fully elucidate the role that anti - vegf dosing schedules play in predisposing patients to inflammatory ocular complications . despite our conjecture regarding the enhanced immunogenic potential of bevacizumab over ranibizumab , a large retrospective study failed to detect a significant difference in the rates of uveitis between the two drugs.3 nevertheless\n, bevacizumab has not been subjected to nearly the same scrutiny ( in the form of rigorous clinical trials ) as ranibizumab , and thus safety data for bevacizumab is relatively lacking.4 the results of future prospective randomized trials comparing the efficacy and side - effect profile of ranibizumab to bevacizumab might help to more definitively answer the questions surrounding the inflammatory sequelae of intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab injections ."}

shaking nystagmus hsn test using video \n electronystagmography ( veng ) .\nthe patients were evaluated for uvh , starting \n first with the sst . in this test\n, the subject is asked to stand with their feet together and \n their hands by their sides .\nthe subject is then asked to close his / her eyes or is \n blindfolded .\nthe test is positive if there is involuntary leaning to one side and hip sway . \n\nsometimes , the subject lifts a hand to compensate . in that case , the subject is asked to \n take two steps sideways and stop , first with the eyes open and then with the eyes closed or \n blindfolded .\nthe test was positive if there is any involuntary swaying and/or any steps \n taken to compensate .\nthe suject is then asked to jog on the spot for 30 seconds with the \n eyes closed or blindfolded .\nthe test is positive if there is \n any involuntary drifting to one side or , in some cases , forward or backward .\nafter finishing the sst , the subject is then evaluated with the hsn test using veng , which \n is the gold standard test used to determine whether a vestibular ( inner ear ) disease may be \n the causative factor for a balance or dizziness problem and is one of the only tests \n available today that can distinguish between a unilateral ( one ear ) and bilateral ( both \n ears ) vestibular dysfunction .\nveng testing consists of a series of tests designed to \n document a person s ability to follow visual objects with their eyes and how well the eyes \n respond to information from the vestibular system . to monitor the movements of the eyes , \n\nhowever , \n during veng testing , the therapist moves the patient s head and body into various positions \n to make sure that there are no inappropriate eye movements ( nystagmus ) , when the patient s \n head is in different positions .\nhsn is a latent spontaneous vestibular nystagmus that can be \n recorded with veng . during the test for hsn\n, the examiner turns the subject s head by about \n 45 degrees horizontally about 20 times .\nhsn is defined as the occurrence of at least 5 beats \n of nystagmus immediately after the head - shaking maneuver , which should be performed with \n frenzel veng goggles .\nthere is good evidence that hsn reflects a dynamic ( peripheral and/or \n central vestibular ) asymmetry of the velocity storage mechanism . in peripheral lesions\n, the \n ipsilateral dynamic vor deficits can lead to an asymmetric accumulation within the velocity \n storage , the discharge of which determines the direction of hsn , usually toward the \n unaffected ear9 . the results of both tests \n were then compared with each other ; the results should be the same in both tests . \n\ndata were analyzed using spss for windows version 19.0 ( spss , inc . , chicago , il , usa ) . \n\nfrequencies and relative frequencies were computed for nominal variables , and means and \n standard deviations ( sd ) were computed for the continuous variables .\nthe  test \n of independence was used to assess the relationship between the sst and the gold standard \n hsn test using veng .\nsensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value and negative predictive value also were \n measured .\nthe baseline frequency characteristics of the study group are presented in table 1table 1.baseline frequency characteristic of the study group ( n = 28)validfrequencypercentsexmale1553.6%female1346.4%hsnpositive1346.4%negative1553.6%sstpositive1657.1%negative1242.9% .\nthe results showed that the sst is strongly correlated with the gold standard \n hsn test using veng ( r = 0.81 , p<0.001 ) .\na stepwise linear regression was conducted to \n determine the effect of the sst on the gold standard ( hsn test using veng ) results \n ( r = 0.65 , p < 0.001 ) .\nsixty -

{"id": 83, "text": "the term cardiorenal syndrome has been introduced recently in an attempt to emphasize the tight interaction between the cardiovascular and renal systems in acute or chronic disease settings and to expand our knowledge regarding its pathogenesis , prevention , and potential treatment .\nthe definition encompasses different syndromes , all involving the heart and the kidney ,  whereby acute or chronic dysfunction of one organ may induce an acute or chronic dysfunction of the other  .\naccording to the site of the initial injury and the acute or chronic nature of the process five distinct syndromes ( types ) are defined . in acute cardio - renal syndrome ( type 1 ) ,\nacute worsening of heart function leads to acute renal dysfunction . in chronic cardiorenal syndrome ( type 2 )\n, chronic cardiac dysfunction leads to chronic renal dysfunction . in acute renocardiac syndrome ( type 3 )\n, acute renal dysfunction causes cardiac dysfunction , and in chronic renocardiac syndrome ( type 4 ) , chronic renal dysfunction leads to cardiovascular disease and increased cardiovascular mortality .\nfinally , type 5 , or secondary cardiorenal syndrome , involves systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus , amyloidosis , systemic lupus erythematosus , or sepsis , which simultaneously affect both the heart and the kidney .\nthis paper will focus on cardiorenal syndrome type 4 ( chronic renocardiac syndrome ) presenting epidemiologic evidence of excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) as well as current knowledge on the pathogenesis and management of this syndrome .\nckd is defined as either a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) to values below 60  ml / min/1.73  m , or the presence of kidney damage as reflected in an abnormal urine sediment ( proteinuria , hematuria , and casts ) or abnormalities in renal architecture ( e.g. , polycystic kidney disease ) even if the gfr is preserved within normal levels .\ngfr may be directly measured by renal clearance of specific substances ( e.g. , creatinine , inulin ) and radioactive markers ( e.g. , 99mtc - dtpa ) or it may be estimated ( estimated gfr - egfr ) , by the application of formulas incorporating serum creatinine and demographic parameters ( cockcroft - gault , mdrd ) .  \nboth proteinuria and the reduction of gfr have been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .\nthis association is so strong and clinically relevant that according to current guidelines the diagnosis of ckd places a patient into the highest cardiovascular risk level , irrespective of stratification according to traditional cardiovascular risk factors [ 3 , 4 ] .\ncompared to the general population , ckd patients are still plagued by a frustratingly high mortality , which is mainly attributed to cardiovascular events , with death being far more probable than advancing into the final ckd stages and the need of renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) .\nthe high mortality afflicting patients on renal rrt , which for the ages between 25 and 35 may rise up to 375-fold compared to the general population , is derived almost by half of cardiovascular causes .\nthe abnormal quantities of protein in the urine ( proteinuria ) consist mainly of albumin ( albuminuria ) and can be semiquantitatively identified by urine dipstick testing , estimated by the urine protein - to - creatinine ratio ( upcr ) or albumin - to - creatinine ratio ( uacr ) in a spot urine sample , or directly measured in a timed ( usually 24  h ) urine collection [ 3 , 8 ] .\nthe diagnosis of microalbuminuria ( 30300  mg / day ) and albuminuria ( > 300  mg / day ) is mainly utilized in the evaluation of diabetic nephropathy , while proteinuria ( > 300  mg / day or upcr > 200  mg / g ) is mostly used for nondiabetic ckd .\nwhether considered a marker of systemic endothelial dysfunction or a result of renal damage , proteinuria has been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in the general population , even at levels regarded as normal . in repeated studies ,\nthe presence of micro- and macroalbuminuria and egfr reduction were independent predictors of increased overall and cardiovascular mortality in diabetic   and nondiabetic individuals . in a recently published large community - based study involving nearly one million adult subjects ,\nhigher levels of proteinuria were independently associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and all - cause mortality , as were decreased levels of egfr .\nthe severity of proteinuria was actually a stronger predictor of worse clinical outcomes than was egfr reduction , a fact suggesting that levels of proteinuria may have a role in risk stratification of ckd patients , who are currently staged only according to their level of gfr .\nirrespective of the presence of proteinuria , gfr decline has been repeatedly associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . in a large community study involving more than one million adults ,\nan independent and graded association was observed between egfr reduction and increased risk of death and cardiovascular events including hospitalization for coronary artery disease , heart failure , stroke , and peripheral vascular disease . in middle - aged adults participating in the atherosclerosis risk in community ( aric )\nstudy , a baseline egfr of less than 60  ml / min/1.73  m was independently associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral arterial disease   or heart failure , irrespective of prevalent coronary artery disease . according to united states\nrenal data system 2007 annual report regarding incident dialysis patients , comorbidities included congestive heart failure in 34% , atherosclerotic heart disease in 22.5% , cerebrovascular disease in 10% , and peripheral vascular disease in 15% of cases . in patients with already established cardiovascular disease\nan inverse relationship between egfr and the extent of coronary stenotic lesions was shown , as well as increased probability of having three - vessel coronary artery disease with decreasing egfr . in a study of almost 15.000 patients , who had suffered myocardial infarction , even mild egfr reduction at baseline was independently associated with increased overall mortality or a composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes , reinfarction , congestive heart failure , stroke , or resuscitation after cardiac arrest . in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ,\na reduced baseline egfr has also been associated with increased 30-day and long - term mortality .\nfurthermore , in patients with advanced congestive heart failure , impaired renal function seems to be a stronger predictor of mortality than impaired cardiac function ( left ventricular ejection fraction and new york heart association class ) .\nfinally , in a recent study also involving patients with heart failure , the presence of albuminuria significantly aggravated prognosis by exhibiting a strong and independent association with increased all - cause and cardiovascular mortality .\ndue to the vital importance for the rapidly growing population of ckd patients , the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to cardiovascular damage in renal disease are under constant investigation .\nmore than a dozen of pathways have been identified including hyperactivity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , osmotic sodium retention , volume overload , endothelial dysfunction , dyslipidemia , coagulopathy , inflammation , and anemia , all leading to histomorphological alterations of the heart and vessels .  \nin addition , some key emerging topics in this field include sympathetic hyperactivity , cardiotonic steroids , nonosmotic sodium retention , and catalytic or labile iron .\nsympathetic activation by the failing kidney leading to both renal disease progression and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality may provide a new target for therapeutic intervention .\ncardiotonic steroids are elevated in renal failure and have been linked to hypertension and to the development of uremic cardiomyopathy in animal models .\nnonosmotic sodium stores in the form of water - free na+ accumulation in the skin have been proposed to contribute to the development of hypertension and thus might be associated to ckd progression and cardiovascular complications .\nfinally , labile / catalytic iron is associated with oxidative stress in situations such as acute kidney injury after cardiac revascularisation and in diseases such as diabetes and may result in both kidney disease progression and cardiovascular complications .\nhowever , an extensive analysis of all the above mechanisms lies outside the scopus of the present paper , and readers are referred to some excellent recent reviews [ 2528 ] .\nthis increase is the result of two separate pathways both leading to left ventricular hypertrophy ( lvh ) : pressure overload and volume overload .\npressure overload mainly derives from increased peripheral resistance and reduced arterial compliance due to sympathetic and renin - angiotensin system hyperactivity , hypertension , endothelial dysfunction , and vascular calcification / stiffening .\nit causes thickening of cardiac myofibres by parallel addition of sarcomeres , thus leading to concentric lvh .\nvolume overload is attributed to sodium and water retention , anemia , and the presence of an arteriovenous fistula in patients with end - stage renal disease ( egfr < 15  ml / min/1.73  m anticipating or on chronic dialysis ) .\nit results in lengthening of the cardiac myofibers by serial addition of sarcomeres thus causing eccentric lvh ( left ventricular dilatation ) [ 29 , 30 ] .\nlvh in renal disease is a pathologic process and , unlike physiologic adaptations to increased workload ( e.g. ,  athletes heart  ) , is accompanied by fibrosis , which is also attributed to conditions related to the uremic milieu , including increased levels of parathyroid hormone , endothelin , aldosterone , catecholamines , and cardiotonic steroids [ 26 , 30 , 31 ] . in a study involving 432 esrd patients , only 16% had a normal echocardiogram at initiation of dialysis , the rest exhibiting mainly features of concentric lvh ( 41% ) and left ventricular dilatation ( 28% ) , both associated with increased risk of heart failure and death .\na more recent study demonstrated progression of concentric lvh in 576 new dialysis patients followed up by echocardiography .\nin addition to fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , histological changes of the heart in uremia also include myocyte apoptosis / necrosis resulting in myocyte number reduction , and microvascular abnormalities such as arteriolar wall thickening and capillary rarefaction , the latter being specific to uremia [ 29 , 34 ] .  \nthe functional consequences of all the aforementioned structural changes include diastolic dysfunction , increased oxygen demand and impaired , myocardial oxygenation unrelated to coronary obstruction [ 34 , 36 ] .\nthis may explain the angiographic finding of patent coronaries in 30%40% of uremic patients with ischemic heart disease / angina pectoris , as well as their predisposition to arrhythmias , both atrial and ventricular , and sudden death , which account for more than half of the cardiovascular mortality of patients on rrt [ 37 , 38 ] .\nsusceptibility to arrhythmias and sudden death may be further increased by coronary artery disease / myocardial infarction , left ventricular hypertrophy , congestive heart failure , electrolyte abnormalities , chronic fluid overload , anemia , autonomic imbalance , and inflammation .\never since early reports of aortic thickening in uremic patients by richard bright in 1827 , renal disease has been associated with vascular pathology .\npathologic features include reduced elasticity / compliance of large arteries , as reflected in an increase of the arterial pulse wave velocity ( pwv ) [ 40 , 41 ] , thickening of the arterial wall , leading to an increased intima - media thickness ( imt ) , and , mainly , vascular calcification [ 43 , 44 ] .  \nvascular calcification has recently been the focus of attention mainly because of its established association with cardiovascular mortality in ckd patients .\nmoreover , in the last decade , research has shown that it is not simply the result of passive mineral precipitation but rather an active and highly regulated process , closely resembling osteogenesis [ 43 , 46 ] , and is orchestrated by the arterial smooth muscle cell after its genotypic transformation to an osteoblast - like cell .\nossification of the arterial wall is favoured by conditions like ageing , diabetes , inflammation , and especially ckd . in renal disease , vascular calcification\nis linked to hyperphosphatemia , lack of calcification inhibitors ( i.e. , fetuin - a , matrix gla protein , osteopontin , or pyrophosphate ) and derangements in regulators of mineral metabolism ( i.e. , vitamin d , parathormone , osteoprotegerin , and bone morphogenetic proteins ) , and abnormalities in bone turnover such as secondary hyperparathyroidism and adynamic bone disease [ 4648 ] .  \nin addition , recent studies implied a role for the phosphatonin fibroblast growth factor-23 ( fgf-23 ) in the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease  mineral bone disorder ( ckd - cmd ) and in vascular calcification .\nfgf-23 levels are elevated in ckd patients both on dialysis and on conservative treatment and have been associated with increased mortality and left ventricular hypertrophy .\nmoreover , fgf-23 has been linked to increased arterial stiffness , endothelial dysfunction , and vascular calcification . however , a causative relation and its value as a marker of cardiovascular status and/or phosphate - related toxicity , as well as its potential role as a target for intervention , still await further clarification .  \ncalcium deposits may surround atheromatous plaques in the arterial intima ( atherosclerosis ) or involve the medial layer of the arteries ( arteriosclerosis  moenckeberg 's sclerosis ) .\nthey can be visualised in plain x - ray films [ 51 , 52 ] and quantified by more sophisticated and more expensive techniques like electron beam computed tomography ( ebct ) [ 53 , 54 ] , the latter regarding mainly coronary artery calcification ( cac ) .\nbecause of the results from experimental models as well as their difference in histopathologic features , location in the arterial tree , and pathophysiologic consequences , they tend to be regarded as distinct   although this view has recently been challenged [ 55 , 56 ]\n. both types of vascular calcification appear early in ckd , run an accelerated course , especially after rrt initiation [ 53 , 54 ] , and lead to high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .\nmore importantly , a recent metareview on treatments for vascular calcification in ckd has demonstrated that no therapy to date , including statins and sevelamer , appears to influence their rate of progression .   in ckd patients ,\ncac score measurement as a tool for cardiovascular risk stratification may be affected by the unique presence of medial coronary calcification [ 58 , 59 ] unrelated to obstructive coronary atherosclerosis , thus not necessarily leading to ischemia .\nnevertheless , a high cac score has been associated with increased mortality in ckd patients both before   and after the initiation of dialysis .\napart from medial calcification , another feature characteristic of coronary artery disease ( cad ) affecting ckd patients is the location of culprit atherosclerotic lesions . in renal patients with acute myocardial infarction\n, they were found to be located more proximal to the coronary ostia , which may account for the observed increased mortality .   because cad is highly prevalent in ckd patients ,\nnoninvasive screening tools for the prediction of asymptomatic coronary obstruction are needed . in recent studies ,\ncardiac troponin t ( ctnt ) has emerged as a powerful predictor of multiple - vessel cad in asymptomatic hemodialysis patients [ 63 , 64 ] . in addition , the acute kidney injury biomarker neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( ngal ) has recently been associated with both chronic renal impairment and cardiovascular complications and might potentially prove its worth as a cardiovascular risk predictor in ckd .\naortic calcification assessed by lateral abdominal x - ray has also been associated with all - cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients and has been proposed as a simple tool for cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment guidance [ 52 , 66 ] .\nbecause of the heavy cvd burden affecting ckd patients , risk modification is vital in an effort to improve outcomes . still ckd patients are usually excluded from large interventional trials   because of their expected adverse outcomes , thus hindering the evaluation of therapeutic interventions . furthermore , interventions for traditional cardiovascular risk reduction already established in the general population have proved less effective in patients with ckd [ 24 , 68 , 69 ] .\nthis seems to result into a kind of  therapeutic nihilism  , by denying treatment despite the presence of sound indications , for example , the underutilisation of antiplatelets , statins ,  blockers , and ace inhibitors in ckd patients with known cad .\nfurthermore , ckd patients are less likely to undergo coronary angiography , percutaneous coronary intervention , or bypass grafting , or to receive adjuvant treatments , such as gpiib / iiia inhibitors .\nstrategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in ckd patients should target both traditional and non - traditional , that is , ckd - related factors .\ntraditional risk factors include hypertension , dyslipidemia , diabetes , obesity , physical activity , and smoking habit , while ckd - related factors refer to ckd progression , proteinuria , anemia , inflammation , mineral and bone disorder , lvh , oxidative stress , coagulopathy , hyperactivity of the renin - angiotensin and the sympathetic nervous system , and dialysis dose and quality   ( table 1 ) . setting of specific treatment targets is complicated , especially in patients on rrt , by findings of reverse epidemiology with a u - shaped curve associating mortality with blood pressure , bmi , cholesterol , and phosphate , possibly a result of the malnutrition - inflammation - atherosclerosis ( mia ) syndrome frequently encountered in this patient population [ 72 , 73 ] .\nfurther controversies also derive from recent results of increased morbidity and mortality in ckd patients associated with higher hemoglobin levels , intensive blood pressure   and glucose control , dual angiotensin ii blockade   and suppression of parathyroid function , and bone turnover [ 47 , 48 ] , which question the safety of overaggressive intervention on specific laboratory and clinical parameters in this patient group . rather than meticulously pursuing generalised targets ,\nrecent opinions suggest a potential benefit from a more individualised perspective , that takes into account patient - specific trends and distinctive dynamic features of the actual clinical situation [ 66 , 78 , 79 ] .  \neagerly awaited is the publication of results from large randomised studies evaluating therapeutic interventions to lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ckd patients , such as the ongoing evolve ( evaluation of cinacalcet hcl therapy to lower cardiovascular events )   and the concluded sharp ( study in heart and renal protection ) .\nthe latter , a double blind placebo - controlled study involving almost 9500 ckd patients ( a third of them on dialysis ) in 18 countries , has been able to demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiovascular events , such as myocardial infarction , stroke , or need for coronary artery revascularization , with the use of a combination of ezetimibe plus simvastatin , according to most recent results presented during the american society of nephrology renal week 2010 . until further results are available , current recommendation for predialysis patients suggests regular exercise , where feasible , smoking cessation , blood pressure control to < 130/80  mmhg with preference to angiotensin - ii - targeted treatment , hba1c levels of < 7.0% , hb levels of 1012  g / dl , ldl cholesterol levels as for the general population with high cardiovascular risk , sodium intake < 2.4  g / day , maintenance of a bmi < 25  kg / m , treatment of proteinuria , and avoidance of nephrotoxicity , aiming , apart from cardiovascular protection , at renal function preservation and slowing of ckd progression [ 3 , 67 , 8284 ] .   for patients on dialysis , blood pressure of < 140/90  mmhg before and < 130/80  mmhg after dialysis is recommended .\noptimal levels of hba1c and ldl - c seem to be less clearly defined , since they may not accurately reflect glycemic status   and atherogenic potential , mainly because of the short erythrocyte lifespan   and the qualitative rather than quantitative lipid abnormalities in uremia .\nspecial consideration must be taken to mineral bone disorder aiming at normal phosphorus levels , avoiding hypercalcemia , and treating secondary hyperparathyroidism judiciously in order to maintain the mineral buffering ability of active bone turnover , in order to ameliorate vascular calcification .\nthe latter is portrayed in recent recommendations regarding vascular calcification screening , phosphate binder choice , and target levels of parathormone [ 66 , 87 , 88 ] .\nalso of importance are dialysis adequacy , quality , and hemodynamic stability , as well as the optimization of conditions regarding inflammation and dialysis - related infections [ 89 , 90 ] .   the treatment and prevention of arrhythmias and sudden death remains a challenge .\napart from attention to electrolyte disorders and avoidance of low - potassium dialysate , whenever possible , the use of  blockers seems beneficial .\nace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers appear promising but have yet to prove their efficacy in prospective trials .\nimplantation of cardiac defibrillators in dialysis patients is associated with increased risk for bleeding and infection . compared to patients with normal renal function\n, their use for primary prevention in ckd patients confers a reduced survival benefit , possibly due to comorbid conditions or increased defibrillation thresholds . on the other hand ,\nimplantation for secondary prevention is underused in dialysis patients , despite a proven effect in reducing mortality [ 37 , 38 ] . in summary ,\nthis can be attributed to the high prevalence of traditional risk factors , such as advanced age , diabetes , and hypertension but also derives from ckd - related morbidity , such as sympathetic and renin - angiotensin hyperactivity , sodium retention , fluid overload , anemia , dyslipidemia , mineral - bone disorder and inflammation , which lead to structural alterations of the heart and vessels ( chronic renocardiac syndrome ) .\naggressive risk modification , high index of suspicion for cardiovascular morbidity , proper intervention , and secondary prevention are essential .\nlarge high - quality trials involving ckd patients are urgently needed to provide results , which could support effective treatment strategies . until such results are available , avoiding  therapeutic nihilism  and aiming at established treatment targets with an individualised patient - oriented approach appears sensible ."}
{"id": 84, "text": "loss of interdental papilla can lead to esthetic concerns , phonetic problems , and food impaction which promote periodontal disease .\nwhen the interdental papilla is lost as a

conducted an investigation to evaluate the staining intensity of fibronectin in human marginal gingiva and interdental papilla by immunohistochemical staining .\na prospective analytical experimental study was performed on 16 healthy subjects referred for crown lengthening surgery .\nall participants were medically healthy , non - smokers , with no medication intake , and a healthy periodontium

.\nthe present study revealed statistically significant fibronectin staining intensity in the connective tissue adjacent to s / j epithelium [ tables 1 and 2 ] which may be due to the unique characteristics of junctional epithelium .\nthe latter has a high rate of cell turnover , 50 - 100 times higher than oral epithelium .\ncell proliferation of junctional epithelium is localized to the basal layer adjacent to the gingival connective tissue . since fibronectin is responsible for cell differentiation and growth factor signaling , its high concentration near a region with high turnover rate may be explainable .\nthe high concentration of fibronectin in junctional epithelium is due to the presence of fibronectin receptors ( integrins ) in this tissue .\nstudies in this context were limited and further investigations are needed to clarify whether interdental papilla possess unique composition ."}
{"id": 85, "text": "lewy body disorders ( lbds ) is an umbrella term that includes diseases with alpha - synuclein ( asyn ) aggregates as fibrils in lewy bodies ( lbs ) and lewy neurites .\nseveral lines of evidence support a pathogenic role of misfolded asyn in lbds [ 13 ] .\nparkinson 's disease ( pd ) without dementia ( pdnd ) is the most common subtype of lbds , followed by pd with dementia ( pdd ) and dementia with lewy bodies ( dlbs ) [ 4 , 5 ] . like in pd ,\nthe core feature of pdd is a diagnosis of pd according to the uk brain bank society criteria   but also includes cognitive symptoms severe enough to fulfil dementia criteria at least one year after pd diagnosis with insidious onset , slow progression , and impairment in more than one cognitive domain .\ndlb is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative dementia after alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) .\nclinical diagnosis is based on the presence of a dementia syndrome , accompanied by at least two out of the three following symptoms : fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness , visual hallucinations , and parkinsonism .\nin contrast to pdd , the onset of dementia in dlb is before or within one year of any parkinsonism .\nabout one - fourth of lbds patients show cortical amyloid - beta ( abeta ) deposition , with the highest proportion in dlb subjects , followed by pdd subjects [ 914 ] . according to clinical , neuroimaging , and neuropathological data , co - occurrence of asyn and abeta\nbased on the central role that asyn and abeta play in the pathogenesis of lbds and the increasing body of literature pointing to defective clearance of misfolded proteins as a key mechanism to the pathogenesis of lbds , this paper aims at providing a condensed review of this latter topic .\nalthough not exhaustive , it may provide a basic understanding of such mechanisms eventually contributing to the development of novel disease biomarkers ( which are currently not available [ 16 , 17 ] ) and neuromodulatory treatment strategies for these still incurable and chronic diseases .\nthe main ( intraneuronal ) pathways for the degradation and recycling of proteins are the ubiquitin / proteasome system ( ups ) and the autophagy - lysosomal pathway ( macroautophagy , microautophagy , and chaperone - mediated autophagy ( cma ) ) .  \nthe ups degrades short - lived nuclear and cytosolic proteins or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum .\nit plays a key role in signal transduction , cell cycle progression , apoptosis , and cellular differentiation and has been implicated in several human diseases , including neurodegenerative diseases , cancer , inflammation , and autoimmunity [ 1820 ] .  \nautophagy is a process involving the degradation of components inside lysosomes [ 21 , 22 ] .\nit has a variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles in protein and organelle clearance , development , defence against microorganisms , cell death , and antigen presentation . in macroautophagy ,\norganelles and macromolecular components are first surrounded by a double membrane , defined as the autophagosome or autophagic vacuole ( av ) , which then fuses with lysosomes to form autolysosomes . in microautophagy\n, the transfer of cytosolic components the lysosomal compartment happens by direct invagination of the lysosomal membrane without prior sequestration into the autophagosome .\nfinally , in cma , individual proteins are targeted to lysosomes by the binding of a hsc70-containing chaperone / cochaperone complex .  \nall these pathways are observable in neurons , and both impairment and excessive activation of these pathways are linked to neurodegenerative processes .\n( extraneuronal ) clearance pathways include interaction of neurons with astro- and microglia and with infiltrating macrophages .\n, other populations of cells may also act as phagocytes , including astrocytes , neural stem cells , and neurons [ 2528 ] .\nthere is no clear evidence for a defective protein clearance by the brain innate immune system as a primary pathogenetic event in neurodegenerative diseases .\nhowever , phagocytosis of misfolded proteins by astro- and microglia triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reactive oxygen / nitrogen species , which may , under pathological conditions , further promote neuronal dysfunction and degeneration [ 29 , 30 ] .  \nthe adaptive immune system is also involved in the clearance of misfolded proteins in the brain .\nnaturally occurring autoantibodies are detectable in body fluids of healthy controls and in patients with neurodegenerative disorders [ 3133 ] .\nfinally , protein transport from the parenchyma to the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) and across the blood - brain barrier are relevant clearance mechanisms and have been shown to be affected in lbds .  \nintra- and extraneuronal clearance mechanisms closely interact : as an example , protein aggregates can stimulate the cell surface innate immune receptors , initiating intracellular signaling cascades that , in turn , stimulate phagocytosis .\nan overview of how these mechanisms may interact is schematically illustrated in figure 1 . in the following ,\nall these mechanisms are discussed in more detail with special emphasis on asyn and abeta clearance .\nabnormal deposition of asyn occurs early in the disease process of lbds and may follow an ascending pattern in most of the cases , starting from lower brainstem areas and then affecting limbic and cortical areas .\ndeposition may start even earlier in the autonomic peripheral nervous system [ 35 , 36 ] .\nthe mechanisms responsible for asyn degradation have been controversial , but it appears that , under normal conditions , asyn is degraded by both the ups and the autophagy - lysosomal pathway [ 3739 ] , whereas the autophagy - lysosomal pathway mediates clearance of accumulated and aggregated asyn . in agreement with this observation , activation of autophagy\nleads to increased wild - type asyn clearance and neuroprotection [ 37 , 40 ] .\nnormal asyn binds to the cma - specific receptor lamp-2a on the lysosomal membrane and is subsequently degraded by cma .\nhowever , mutant forms of asyn ( a53 t and a30p ) and asyn modified by dopamine tightly bind to the cma receptors on the lysosomal membrane and inhibit both their own degradation and that of other cma substrates [ 38 , 41 ] . the dysfunction of cma triggers neuronal dysfunction and increases vulnerability to stress .\ninterestingly , both mutant and wild - type asyn can decrease proteasomal activity and increase vulnerability to neurodegeneration , leading to a vicious cycle where an increased amount of intraneuronal asyn can block its clearance by itself [ 38 , 4246 ] .  \nthe main proteins involved in cma ( lamp2a and hsc70 ) are decreased in the sn and amygdala from pd patients .\nmicrotubule - associated protein 1a/1b - light chain 3 ( lc3 , a marker for autophagic vacuoles ) colocalizes with asyn in most lbs and lewy neurites .  \ngenetic mutations leading to parkinsonism support the hypothesis that defective clearance mechanisms are centrally involved also in idiopathic forms of lbds . interaction between pink1 and parkin can modulate mitophagy [ 47 , 48 ] .\na reduced clearance of mitochondria was also demonstrated in cells lacking dj-1 which is another protein associated with recessive forms of parkinsonism .\nmutations in the lrrk2 gene , the most common form of late onset autosomal dominant parkinsonism , may also cause neuronal cell death via impairment of protein degradation pathways as they influence the autophagy - lysosomal pathway , leading to asyn accumulation and aggregation [ 51 , 52 ] .\nheterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase ( gba ) convey an approximately 5-fold risk for pd .\nthese mutations are associated with lysosomal dysfunction and influence binding of asyn to its specific receptor at the lysosome membrane : a recent study demonstrated that the accumulation of the gba substrate glucosylceramide stabilizes asyn soluble oligomers which , in turn , can inhibit normal gba lysosomal activity .\nthe heterozygous gba mutation also seems to directly influence fatty acid metabolism : pd patients with these mutations have lower csf levels of palmitoleic , oleic , linoleic , arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic acids compared with both idiopathic pd patients and controls .  \nalthough asyn is a cytosolic protein , a low quantity of the protein is secreted via vesicle exocytosis and is then present in biological fluids including plasma and csf [ 5557 ] .\nthe mechanisms responsible for the extraneuronal clearance of asyn are not entirely clear ; however , there is increasing evidence that adjacent cells such as astrocytes and microglia as well as the adaptive immune system and local protein transport mechanisms are crucially involved .  \nloss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal degeneration can be preceded by neuroinflammation marked by activated microglia and an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 29 , 30 , 5862 ] .\n, extraneuronal forms of asyn can activate glial cells and trigger inflammation and subsequent release of proinflammatory molecules , a common pathological hallmark of lbds [ 60 , 65 ] .\nseveral studies have reported asyn - containing inclusions in astroglia of pd and dlb patients , and phagocytic microglial cells are very efficient scavengers of extraneuronal asyn aggregates [ 63 , 67 ] .\nresults of recent gwas studies argue for the relevance of the immune system , in the pathophysiology of lbds , as variations in the human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) region were associated with occurrence of lbds [ 68 , 69 ] .\nthis may also be mediated through microglia as these cells are capable of presenting antigens to lymphocytes   via the hla domain .\nactivation of hla - positive microglia is observable in affected brain regions of pd patients .\nthese results were basically confirmed by a recent study where serum asyn autoantibody levels were higher in demented lbds patients than in controls .  \nan overload of local asyn can also occur due to defective transport mechanisms of asyn from the neuron to the csf .\nmost studies investigating csf total asyn levels in pd showed that these levels are reduced in the csf of pd patients compared to controls , whereas oligomeric asyn levels seem to be higher in pd compared to control csf [ 57 , 7377 ] .\na recent study showed that csf levels of phosphorylated asyn correlate weakly with pd severity and , if corrected for total asyn , contributed to the differential diagnosis between pd , multiple system atrophy ( msa ) , and progressive supranuclear palsy ( psp ) .\nhowever , it is neither clear to date how asyn is transported from the parenchyma to the csf , nor why total asyn is reduced and pathological forms of asyn are elevated in the csf of pd patients .\ncomparable to lbds pathophysiology , in ad , only some rare genetic mutations lead to increased app expression or to changes in abeta stability or aggregation .\nthe common late onset sporadic ad seems to be far better explained by impaired abeta clearance mechanisms .\nthus , assuming that similar mechanisms may occur in ( late onset ) ad and lbds and that abeta pathology is a pathophysiologically relevant feature of lbds , a discussion of ( ineffective ) abeta clearance mechanisms as they occur in ad may substantially contribute to our understanding of how abeta may ( or may not ) be cleared in lbds .  \nthere is convincing evidence from electron microscopy studies   that the autophagy - lysosomal pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of ad .\navs which are the major reservoir of intraneuronal abeta are abundant in affected neurons , especially in those with neurofibrillary tangles .\nthese studies argue for an impaired maturation of autophagolysosomes and impaired intraneuronal retrograde transport in ad .\ndefective clearance of abeta - generating avs may result in abeta accumulation [ 83 , 84 ] .\nseveral further findings corroborate the hypothesis that impaired autophagy plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration in ad .\nbeclin1 is decreased in ad brains , and decreased neuronal autophagy and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration are observed in mice carrying a heterozygous deletion of beclin1 .\npresenilin 1 ( ps1 ) is essential for maturation of the lysosomal proton pump and affects autophagocytosis and protein turnover .\nabeta concentration is tightly regulated by amyloid - degrading proteolytic enzymes and perivascular drainage [ 8789 ] .\nneprilysin ( nep ) is an abeta - degrading protein found at presynaptic terminals and in body fluids [ 90 , 91 ] .\nit is a preferentially membrane - bound , presynaptically located protein with an extracellular catalytic site which can degrade abeta [ 90 , 91 ] .\na soluble form of nep is detectable in body fluids such as blood and csf , emanating from a slow release from the membranes .\nmost interestingly , reduced csf nep activity levels have been shown to occur in early ad [ 93 , 94 ] .  \nanother protein involved in defective clearance mechanisms in ad is cystatin c. neurons , among other cells , are able to produce and secrete this protein\n. fourfold higher levels of cystatin c in the csf than in blood   indicate a relevant role of the protein in cns pathways .\nthere is evidence that ad patients have reduced csf cystatin c levels [ 99 , 100 ] .\nthis makes it intriguing to hypothesize that a deficient abeta - binding capacity , as induced by a lack of ( functional ) cystatin c , may contribute to the amyloidogenic process in ad .\nindeed , increased expression of this protein has been shown to reduce parenchymal abeta load in mouse models of ad [ 101 , 102 ] .\nof note , the bb genotype of the cystatin c - encoding gene  which leads to reduced cystatin c secretion from the neuron to the extracellular space [ 103 , 104]conveys susceptibility to ad .  \ninflammatory reactions , characterized by activated microglia and astrocytes surrounding amyloid deposits , are intimately associated with the onset and progress of ad [ 106108 ] .\nreactive astrocytes with abeta - positive granules are found in close proximity to amyloid plaques .\nhuman astrocytes express scavenger receptors and several abeta - degrading enzymes such as nep , insulin - degrading enzyme ( ide ) , endothelin - converting enzyme ( ece ) , angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) , plasminogen activators , and the matrix metalloproteinases-9 and -2 ( mmp-9 , mmp-2 ) [ 109112 ] .\nclinicopathological studies suggest that microglial activation is an early event in ad pathology [ 113 , 114 ] .\nactivated microglia surround amyloid fibril deposits , and postmortem studies have shown significant amounts of abeta in microglial cells of ad patients treated with immunization therapy [ 115 , 116 ] .\nmicroglia express toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , a family of highly conserved molecules that recognize pathogen - associated molecular patterns , including both exogenous and endogenous ligands .\ntlr2 and tlr4 have been associated with the removal of abeta , indicating that the innate immune system plays a key role in preventing the brain from abeta deposits [ 118120 ] .  \nin addition , the adaptive immune system is obviously involved in cns parenchyma clearance mechanisms . naturally occurring antibodies directed against abeta\nhave been detected in the csf and plasma of patients with ad and healthy control subjects .\nsome studies have shown reduced csf levels of anti - abeta antibodies in patients with ad compared with healthy control subjects [ 32 , 121 ] and in individuals at increased risk for ad .\nanother study reported that a subset of conformation - specific , cross - reactive antibodies that may protect against amyloidogenic toxic peptides are reduced in ad patients .\nas a consequence of these findings , a number of phase ii and iii clinical trials are currently under way to test the effect of such autoantibodies in ad patients .\nfirst results are promising : a recent study using carbon 11-labeled pittsburgh compound b ( [ 11c]pib ) positron emission tomography ( pet ) has shown that passive immunization can reduce the level of brain amyloid in vivo after 18 months of antibody treatment .\nto the best of our knowledge there is no study available that investigated intraneuronal mechanisms of abeta clearance in lbds .\nthere is however indirect evidence that deficits of ( intraneuronal ) defence mechanisms against abeta toxicity may exist , at least in demented lbds patients .\nwe recently showed that csf levels of uric acid , an antioxidant detectable in neurons and associated with pd progression , were significantly lower in demented than in nondemented lbds patients .\nin addition , these levels correlated positively with csf abeta42 levels , with highest correlation values in controls and lowest in demented lbds patients . in the light of the recent\nfinding that csf abeta levels increase within hours after trauma and thus reflect a sufficient and fast response to neuronal stress , a weak correlation of csf abeta42 with uric acid may indicate deficits in this repair mechanism .  \nlowered csf nep activity levels have been found in demented lbds patients , compared to nondemented lbds patients and controls .\nthese data argue for a role of nep in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline in lbds .  \nalso cystatin c seems to be relevantly involved in abeta - associated cognitive decline in lbds .\nour group investigated csf and serum levels in lbds patients   and found lower csf cystatin c levels in demented lbds patients compared to pdnd and controls . in additions ,\nthese levels correlated positively with age at onset of dementia but not with parameters associated with parkinsonism .\nnotably , the correlation between csf cystatin c and csf abeta42 levels was highly significant in nondemented individuals , but not significant in demented patients .\nthis indicates that cystatin c - related abeta transport from the neuron to the csf is impaired in demented lbds patients .\nthe risk genotype of the cst3 gene , bb , was detectable only in demented lbds patients and was associated with low csf cystatin c levels .\nthe role of the innate immune system in abeta clearance in lbds is not well understood although neuroinflammatory reactions are a common finding in lbds and are considered to play a key role in the neurodegenerative process .\nactivated microglia is associated with asyn - positive oligodendrocytes in msa patients and in an animal model of this disease [ 131 , 132 ] .\nastrocytic abnormalities also occur [ 133 , 134 ] .   the adaptive immune system is also involved in abeta - associated mechanisms in lbds .\nautoantibodies against abeta were elevated in serum and csf of demented lbds patients , compared to controls and were even higher than in other forms of dementia such vascular dementia .\nstill , many questions remain about the contribution of the immune system , such as microglia , macrophages , and t cells but also other immune cells , to clearance of misfolded proteins in the cns .\nalthough many questions remain open , recent literature suggests that impairment of protein clearance is one of the key factors mediating the degeneration of vulnerable neuronal populations in lbds .\nan improved understanding of such pathways can provide the basis for new developments in the biomarker era and , ultimately , contribute to the development of neuromodulatory or even causal treatment strategies ."}

{"id": 87, "text": "western flower thrips ( wft ) , frankliniella occidentalis , is a highly polyphagous insect that causes both direct and indirect effects on plant development and health .\nthe adults and larvae feed on epidermal and subepidermal cells of both meristematic and mature leaf and flower tissues , inhibiting plant growth and development and causing necrotic or light - reflective blotches on the tissue .\nfurthermore , they indirectly damage plants by transmitting tospoviruses such as tomato spotted wilt virus ( reitz , 2009 ) . as a result\n, wft has become the most serious pest in several vegetable and flower crops world - wide ( daughtrey et al . , 1997 ; reitz , 2009 ) .\nthe widespread use of chemical insecticides to control wft has led to increasing resistance against the major classes of synthetic insecticides ( broadbent and pree , 1997 ; flanders et al . , 2000 ; broughton and herron , 2009 ) . the growing awareness and demand for insecticides that are not environmentally hazardous has stimulated the study of plant - derived compounds for pest control ( boeke et al . , 2004 ) .\nsuch compounds could be used as natural pesticides , and in theory , genes responsible for the biosynthesis of those compounds could be isolated and transferred to crops to improve plant defense against wft ( annadana et al . , 2002 ;\namong the sources of botanical pesticides , pyrethrins from pyrethrum plants ( tanacetum cinerariifolium ) represent the economically most important class of compounds with broad usage both in homes and organic agriculture ( casida , 1973 ) .\npyrethrins are neurotoxins that bind to voltage - gated sodium channels of neuronal cells , causing the channels to remain open ( davies et al . , 2007 ) .\npyrethrins comprise a group of six closely related esters , named pyrethrin i and ii , cinerin i and ii , and jasmolin i and ii . they are found in all aboveground parts of the pyrethrum plants , but predominantly in the ovaries of the flower heads ( brewer , 1973 ) . on average , the concentration of pyrethrins is about 0.1  % ( dry weight ) in leaves and 1 - 2  % ( dry weight ) in flowers ( baldwin et al . , 1993 ) . assuming a water content of 90  % , pyrethrins account for around 0.01  % of the fresh weight of leaves and 0.1 - 0.2  % of the fresh weight of flowers .\npyrethrins are effective against a broad spectrum of insects , while their toxicity for mammals is very low , allowing their use as a preharvest spray ( casida and quistad , 1995 ; schoenig , 1995 ) .\nwestern flower thrips are sensitive to synthetic pyrethroids ( thalavaisundaram et al . , 2008 ) , but there is no report on the effect of natural pyrethrins against wft .\npyrethrins might provide pyrethrum with a broad range protection against many different insect pests , but the role of pyrethrins in pyrethrum defense has not been studied . in initial experiments , we observed that wft adults died within one day when fed pyrethrum leaves , but that they were abundant in open flowers . here , we tested the hypothesis that pyrethrins are responsible for protecting pyrethrum leaves against wft by assessing adult and embryo toxicity , and by examining feeding and oviposition deterrence both in vitro and in planta .\na pyrethrum field close to luxi , yunnan province , china , was used for surveying thrips populations ( 2427'10.34\"n-10332'21.01\"e ) .\nthe field was 0.5  ha in size , and the presence of insect species was monitored during the flowering period of spring 2010 , when the flowers were predominantly in developmental stages 25 [ numbered according to casida ( 1973 ) ] . to assess populations of small resident insects including thrips , flowers at each developmental stage\neach flower was taken by the stem and turned upside down into a jar containing 75  % alcohol .\nthe procedure was repeated until each jar contained the insects from 100 flowers from a single block and at a particular stage .\nthe number of insects of each species for each stage was scored . in the case of thrips ,\nthe number of adults and larvae were scored separately . among all collected thrips , 30 were randomly picked and identified , where possible to the species level .\na population of wft was mass - reared on flowering chrysanthemum ( chrysanthemum morifolium ramat . )\nsunny casa in a greenhouse under a photoperiod of l16:d8 at 25    2c . in this study ,\nthe chrysanthemum plants used for bioassays were from the same cultivar , but were grown in an insect - free compartment of the greenhouse under the same light and temperature conditions .\nall bioassays were conducted in a climate room at 2022c with a l16:d8 photo regime .\npyrethrum oil ( 70  % w / w ) had been extracted from dried and ground pyrethrum flower heads with liquid co2 leaving no solvent residue ( honghe senju biological co. ltd . , yunnan , china ) .\nbutylated hydroxytoluene ( bht ) had been added to the oil ( 1  % ) to prevent oxidation .\nwe confirmed the concentration and composition of the oil by gas chromatography  mass spectrometry comparison to a pyrethrin standard ( nguyen et al . , 1998 ) . since the major insecticidal compounds in pyrethrum\nhave long been known as pyrethrins ( casida , 1973 ) , the effect of pyrethrum oil was considered to be the effect of pyrethrins . when calculating the concentrations of pyrethrins in different solutions ,\nthe percentage of pyrethrins in the oil ( 70  % ) was taken into account .\nfor example , 1  % ( w / v ) pyrethrins was prepared by dissolving 14.3  mg pyrethrum oil in 1  ml solvent . the toxicity of pyrethrins was evaluated by topical application to thrips ( robb et al . , 1995 ) .\npyrethrum oil was dissolved in acetone to achieve a concentration range of 1 to 30  mg pyrethrins per ml , and the solutions were applied to the thorax with a 10-l glass syringe at 1  l per thrips .\nthe droplet briefly covered the thorax of the insect and also the paper support before evaporating in a few seconds , leaving a residue both on the insect and the support .\nafter treatment , all thrips were transferred to petri dishes containing a piece of chrysanthemum leaf embedded in an agar substrate .\nmortality was assayed after 24  h by counting the number of insects that did not respond to prodding with a fine brush .\nsix replicates were used for each concentration , and 10 thrips were used per replicate .\npercent mortality was corrected for mortality observed in acetone control using schneider - orelli s formula ( schneider - orelli , 1947 ) .\na dual - choice leaf disk assay was used to determine the deterrent effect of pyrethrins on wft .\nall leaf disks ( diam 1.6  cm ) were punched from chrysanthemum leaves of similar leaf age .\npyrethrum oil was dissolved in 0.2  % ( v / v ) aqueous tween-80 to achieve 3 concentrations of pyrethrins : 0.01 , 0.1 , and 1  % ( w / v ) .\ncontrol leaf disks were sprayed with solvent solution ( 0.2  % tween-80 ) , and test leaf disks were sprayed with the pyrethrin solutions using a potter precision laboratory spray tower , which produced a uniform deposit ( 3  l / cm ) of solution on the leaf disks .\ngroups of 10 wft were positioned between a control and a test leaf disk placed abaxial side up and 2  cm apart on a 1.5  % ( w / v ) agar - bed in a petri dish ( 7  cm diam ) .\nafter positioning the thrips , the petri dish was covered by a 120  m mesh size nylon mesh lid to prevent condensation .\nthe number of wft on each leaf disk was recorded 0.25 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 20 , and 28  h after the release of the wft .\neach concentration was replicated with 12 leaf disks . at each time point , a student 's paired t - test was used to assess the significance of the differences in the mean number of wft between test and control .\noviposition - deterrent effects were assayed with a non - choice method slightly modified from annadana et al .\nthe assay was conducted in perspex ring cages ( 3  cm in length and 3.5  cm diam ) , which were closed with a nylon mesh at the bottom .\npollen of scotch pine ( pinus sylvestris l. ) was supplied in a small open tube as food source for wft . after placing 10 wft in a cage ,\nthe top was sealed with two layers of stretched parafilm , with 300  l aqueous solution in between the layers .\nthe solutions used were water , 0.2  % tween-80 , or pyrethrins at 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1  % dissolved in 0.2  % tween-80 .\nwft were allowed to adapt to the diet ( pollen and water ) for 3  d , and then every day for 5  d fresh test solution was provided .\nall eggs were deposited in the solutions , and were counted daily under a binocular microscope .\ndata were analyzed by a one - way anova and a mean separation test was conducted using lsd (   =  0.05 ) . around 200 wft were kept in a perspex ring cage ( 7  cm in length and 9  cm diam ) to allow oviposition in a water solution as described above .\neggs laid on the same day were collected with a fine brush under a binocular microscope and then transferred to 2 layers of filter paper in petri dishes ( 3.5  cm diam ) .\nthe filter papers were drenched in 300  l of assay solution ( water , 0.2  % tween-80 or pyrethrins at 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1  % in 0.2  % tween-80 ) so that each paper was fully wetted but had no excess solution . after transferring the eggs ,\nthe developmental status of eggs was monitored every day for 6  d. to facilitate the observations , the bottoms of the petri dishes were marked with lines that could be seen through the filter paper from the top , and the eggs were placed on filter paper along these lines .\nthis facilitated finding the eggs under the microscope , and the viability of hatched larvae was assessed in terms of their ability to move away ( > 0.5  cm ) from the hatch position .\ndata were analyzed by a one - way anova and mean separation test was conducted using lsd (   =  0.05 ) .\nmature pyrethrum leaves were harvested in november from a field in the netherlands when they were still flowering ( 5159'22.08\"n-539'44.75\"e , wageningen ) .\ntwo or three pieces of leaves were placed , abaxial side up , on 1  % ( w / v ) agar in a petri dish ( 7  cm diam ) . after transferring 10 wft to each petri dish ,\npetri dishes with two leaf disks ( 1.6  cm diam ) of chrysanthemum leaves , with a total mass similar to the mass of the pyrethrum leaf samples , or with only agar were used as controls .\nthe mortality of wft was recorded daily for 3  d. to test the in planta activity of pyrethrins against wft , pyrethrins were infiltrated into whole chrysanthemum leaves as described by ratcliff et al .\nleaf disks ( diam 1.6  cm ) were punched from the infiltrated leaves , avoiding the infiltration points so that wft would not contact pyrethrins directly except at the edge of the disk . in the initial experiments , we infiltrated only water into the leaves and determined that on average 29.1  mg (  2.1  mg ) water could be infiltrated into each leaf disk ( 6 replicates ) .\nas the fresh weight of each leaf disk was on average 45.3  mg (  1.2  mg ) , we infiltrated 0.025 , 0.25 , or 2.5  % pyrethrins solution to bring the concentrations to 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1  % pyrethrins .\nthe assay and data analysis were conducted as described above for the choice assays with topically applied pyrethrins .\nthe number of wft on each leaf disk was recorded 0.25 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 20 , and 28  h after the release of the wft . to test the effects of pyrethrins on oviposition and hatching of larvae\n, wft were assayed with chrysanthemum leaf disks as described by de kogel et al .\nleaf disks were punched from untreated leaves , from leaves infiltrated with 0.2  % tween-80 , or from leaves containing 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1  % pyrethrins in tween solution .\nwft were placed on leaf disks ( 1.2  cm diam , 2 wft / disk ) , which were embedded , abaxial side up , on agar in wells of 24-well greiner plates .\nplates were covered with parafilm , and every well was carefully sealed by pressing the parafilm on the edge of each well .\nwft were allowed to oviposit for 48  h and were then removed , with simultaneous assessment of mortality . subsequently , half of the leaf disks from each plate were used to determine the number of eggs , and the other half of the leaf disks were used to determine the number of hatched larvae . to determine the number of eggs\n, the leaf disks were boiled in water for 3  min so that the eggs were clearly visible under a binocular microscope with transmitting light . to determine the number of hatched larvae , the leaf disks were transferred to petri dishes containing water and incubated in a climate chamber ( 25c , l16:d8 ) for 5  d to allow the larvae to hatch .\ndata were analyzed by a one - way anova and mean separation test was conducted using lsd (   =  0.05 ) .\nour field survey in china showed that several thrips species were the most abundant ( 98  % ) insects on pyrethrum flowers ( table  1 ) .\nin addition , a few nysius species ( heteroptera : lygaeidae ) ( 1.9  % ) and lacewing larvae ( neuroptera ) ( 0.05  % ) were found .\na total of 30 individuals were identified to species level ; the thrips species found were mainly thrips tabaci ( 44  % ) , frankliniella occidentalis ( western flower thrips , or wft , 25  % ) , and thrips flavus ( 22  % ) .\nthe number of thrips in flowers was dependent on the flower s developmental stage ( fig .  1 ) .\nthe number of thrips increased until stage 3 ( the first row of disk florets are open ) , and then decreased in later stages .\nlarvae accounted for 7 - 26  % of the total number of thrips per flower , depending on the flower developmental stage ( fig . \n1).table 1frequencies of small

we assayed the suitability of pyrethrum leaves as a food substrate for wft .\nmortality could be as high as 80  % within 3  days , although the degree of mortality depended on the plant source ( data not shown ) .\nwhen only water and agar were provided , with no plant - based food , only 20 - 30  % wft died in 3  days .\nthis showed that the mortality of wft was caused by a toxic principle of pyrethrum leaves rather than deterrence or starvation .\nthe toxic principle of pyrethrum plants against insects has long been known to be a group of 6 pyrethrin esters ( casida , 1973 ) .\nwe were , therefore , interested in specifically testing the effect of pyrethrins against wft . to determine the effects of pyrethrins against wft\n, pyrethrins were tested in vitro at different concentrations on adult mortality , feeding , oviposition , and embryo development .\nthe mortality of wft female adults increased with the concentration of topically applied pyrethrins in the range of 1 to 30  mg / ml . probit analysis showed that the lc50 and lc90 of pyrethrins was 12.9  mg / ml ( with 95  % confidence limit of 10.9 - 14.8  mg / ml ) and 39.0  mg / ml ( with 95  % confidence limit from 30.7 to 50.4  mg / ml ) , respectively .\nthrips were significantly deterred from feeding by 0.1  % and 1  % pyrethrins ( fig .  2 ) .\nwhen given a choice between chrysanthemum leaf disks coated with 0.2  % tween ( control ) or 0.1  % added pyrethrins , after 2  h significantly more ( 61 - 77  % of thrips ) settled on control leaf disks .\nwithin 1  h , 72 - 90  % of thrips chose control leaf disks .\nfor both concentrations of pyrethrins , the maximum deterrent effect was reached at 4  h. application of 0.01  % pyrethrins on leaf disks did not show significant deterrent effects except at the 4  h time point ( fig .  2).fig .\n2dual choice assays of western flower thrips on chrysanthemum leaf disks sprayed with 0.2  % tween ( control ) or 0.2  % tween with 0.01  % , 0.1  % or 1  % pyrethrins

control ( * : p  <  0.05 ; * * : p  <  0.01 ) .\npyrethrins , well - known natural insecticidal compounds , are found exclusively in and extracted from the composite flowers of pyrethrum ( tanacetum cinerariifolium ) , which belongs to anthemideae tribe within the astaraceae family ( casida and quistad , 1995 ) . remarkably , the potential role of pyrethrins in pyrethrum plant defense has not been studied . here\n, we report that western flower thrips ( wft ) adults thrive on pyrethrum flowers , but die within a few days on pyrethrum leaves . the hypothesis that pyrethrins are responsible for protecting pyrethrum leaves against wft was tested by spraying or infiltrating pyrethrins to leaves of chrysanthemum , a related pyrethrins - free species belonging to the same tribe .\nwe assessed toxicity to the adult and embryo stages of wft , and negative effects on feeding and oviposition both in vitro and in planta , and found that the natural concentrations of pyrethrins present in leaves have strong negative effects on wft .\nwe speculate that the thrips found on pyrethrum flowers survive on pollen that is devoid of pyrethrins ( t. yang , unpublished data ) . for many populations of wft\n, resistance has been reported for some synthetic insecticides ( espinosa et al . , 2005 ) .\npreviously , several other plant - derived compounds were tested for their insecticidal effects against wft adults .\nfor example , carvacrol at 1  % and thymol at 0.1  % and 1  % significantly reduced the oviposition rate of wft when these compounds were sprayed on leaf disks , but neither compound affected the feeding activity of wft ( sedy and kosehier , 2003 ) .\nsalicylaldehyde ( 0.1  % and 1  % ) and methyl salicylate ( 0.1  % and 1  % ) were also tested . within 24  h of applying 1  % methyl salicylate to bean or cucumber , the feeding and oviposition activities of thrips females\nthe insect could be a result of changes in the plant induced by methyl salicylate , since it is a plant hormone involved in induced resistance ( pieterse et al . , 2009 ) .\na series of commercially available plant - derived essential oils tested at recommended concentrations ( 0.02 - 0.5  % ) , including neem oil , rosemary oil , peppermint oil , garlic oil , and cottonseed oil , caused less than 30  % mortality within 7  days ( cloyd et al . , 2009 ) .\nour results showed that 0.1  % and 1  % pyrethrin solutions sprayed on leaf disks significantly deterred wft at 4  h , and topically applied pyrethrins were toxic to adults at an lc50 value of 12.9  mg / ml ( 1.3  % ) . by mimicking the natural site of pyrethrin accumulation by infiltration of leaves\n, we found that 1  % pyrethrins caused 69  % mortality and completely inhibited oviposition .\nfurthermore , 0.1  % pyrethrins was strongly deterrent and resulted in abortion of 95  % of the embryos , while as little as 0.01  % pyrethrins caused 25  % mortality in 2  days .\nwe propose , therefore , that the natural concentrations of pyrethrin in pyrethrum leaves , around 0.01  % by fresh weight , accounts for the observed high mortality of thrips adults on this plant .\nwft eggs are embedded in plant tissues ( childers , 1997 ) , and as a result they are unlikely to be affected by non - systemic chemicals that are applied on the surface of plants .\nhowever , pyrethrins naturally accumulate inside pyrethrum tissues , stored in what appear to be unstructured intercellular cavities ( m.a .\njongsma , unpublished observations ) . therefore , besides feeding and oviposition deterrence , the embryo - toxic effect of pyrethrins is a third component that contributes to their effect for plant defense against wft ( figs .  4 and 5 ) .\ncompared to some synthetic insecticides , the toxicity of natural pyrethrins against wft in the absence of synergists was not high . in previous studies using topical application methods , the lc50 values of insecticides tested against susceptible wft strains ranged from 10 to 83  g / ml for pyrethroids , 20 to 960  g / ml for carbamates , and 49 to 522  g / ml for organophosphates ( espinosa et al . , 2005\nthe lc50 value of pyrethrins against wft by topical application was determined as 12.9  mg / ml , and the action of pyrethrins was , therefore , 10 to 1000-fold weaker than for these synthetic pesticides . on the other hand\n, pyrethrins did show much stronger negative effects on feeding behavior and reproduction , which may be explained by the action of pyrethrins on the nervous system , resulting in disordered function of excitable ( nerve and muscle ) cells ( bradberry et al . ,\npyrethrins not only caused mortality of adults and embryos , but also significantly reduced oviposition ( table  2 ) .\nall these factors together cumulatively affect the life history parameters . as a result wft damage on pyrethrin - containing leaves\nwe hypothesize that if plants such as closely related chrysanthemum species , which do not contain any pyrethrins , were genetically engineered to produce pyrethrins , their resistance to wft in leaves could be significantly improved ."}

drivers to control the position of the cutting blade .\nthis method has reduced the inconsistency inherent in other models of creating a laceration sci .\nthis method is particularly useful in studying axonal regeneration of the long spinal cord pathways located in the dorsal half of the spinal cord , such as the corticospinal tract , the rubrospinal tract , and the dorsal ascending tract . with this method\nerrors of data interpretation are minimized , thereby improving reliability of reporting of experimental studies on sci . in summary\n, we have described a novel technique to create a reproducible in vivo model of cervical spinal cord laceration injury in the mouse .\nthis technique is based on spine stabilization by fixation of the cervical facets and laceration of the spinal cord using an oscillating blade . using this method in a dorsal thoracic spinal cord laceration model in mice\n, we demonstrated a tight correlation between the laceration depth , histology , and behavior recovery .\nseveral authors ( ypz , xmx , cbs ) have a financial interest in the louisville impactor system , inc .\nthe authors , yi ping zhang , lisa b. e. shields , and christopher b. shields , are employees of norton healthcare , louisville , ky .\nthe authors did not receive funding from any company that produce reagents or instruments utilized in this article ."}
{"id": 89, "text": "penile cancer is rare , and in denmark , it has traditionally been diversely managed in dermatology , surgery , urology , and oncology without management guidelines and systematic quality monitoring . in 2009 ,\na centralization of service to two university hospitals and two specialties , urology and oncology , favored continuous prospective data collection and initiated several quality improvements .\nthe purpose of this study is to describe the danish national penile cancer quality database ( dapeca - data ) .\nthe dapeca - data is a nationwide clinical cancer database with prospective data collection since june 2011 ( table 1 ) . by the means of the danish civil registration system , the database enables individual data collection and holds potential for a large number of data - linkage opportunities to existing and longstanding national registries on , for example , socioeconomic and pharmacological parameters . to our knowledge , within penile cancer registries ,\nthis possibility is only matched by the swedish penile cancer registry enabling dapeca - data to supply important population - based data on this rare entity .\ndapeca - data is affiliated with the danish national penile cancer quality group ( dapeca - group ) , which consists of clinical and paraclinical experts from the specialties oncology , pathology , and urology .\nthe group is responsible for developing national clinical guidelines for the staging , treatment , and follow - up of penile cancer in denmark and decides on quality indicators and indicator standards based on experience and available literature.1 the overall aim of dapeca database and dapeca - group is to improve the quality of cancer care for penile cancer patients in denmark .\nmore specifically , the purpose of dapeca - data is to systematically collect key clinical variables on all incident penile cancer patients in denmark for quality improvement and research .\npenile cancer care in denmark is centralized to two university centers.2 the dapeca - data monitors referral practice from regional hospitals and private practices within surgery / urology , dermatology , and general practice and monitors guideline adherence at the treating centers .\nthe dapeca - data aims to assure modern staging and treatment of patients with penile cancer and to provide data for development of the research field .\npenile cancer is a rare disease with an incidence in developed countries in the range of 0.52.5/100,000 population / year.3 the incidence in denmark is estimated to be 0.8/100,000 population / year , and the mean age at diagnosis is 65 years.4 data on 65 patients are entered into the database each year , which has currently accumulated to more than 200 entries .\ndue to the rarity of the disease , it is a high priority of the dapeca - group and dapeca - data to collaborate with other databases in scandinavia and in other northern european countries with comparable populations .\ncurrently , an application for a common scandinavian database is under preparation with the success of the common scandinavian childhood cancer databases as a model.5\nthe dapeca - data registers all patients with newly diagnosed invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the penis in denmark . patients with penile tumors with nonsquamous cell carcinoma histopathological features , such as sarcoma , melanoma , lymphoma , and metastases , from other cancers are not registered in the dapeca - data since each of these entities are covered by other national databases .\ntumors of the distal urethra ( navicular fossa ) are registered if they involve external aspects of penile anatomy .\ninclusion in the database is based on registration of a patient in the danish pathology registry6 with relevant systematized nomenclature of human medicine ( snomed ) codes or registration in the danish national patient registry and the danish cancer registry with relevant icd codes ( dc609 , dc609j , dc609k , dc609l , dc609 m , dc609n , dc609p , dc609q , dc609r , dc609s , dc609 t , dc609u , and dc609z).7\nonline registration by the urologist responsible for treatment has the advantage of a high level of data quality and variable validity . on the other hand ,\nongoing validation projects of data accumulating via the danish pathology and danish patient registries aim to move a considerable part of the data registration toward automated data extraction and validation from these registries by treating clinicians via patient interview and examination or medical record verification .\nthe annual reports published so far have been based mainly on this type of data , and it has turned out that continuous validation and interaction between clinicians and statisticians are of great importance in order to produce a valid and meaningful report .\na solid framework for continuous validation algorithms and iterative data checking has to be designed and validated to speed this process up in order to meet the demand of the political visions of close - to real - time quality data production .\nthis process is currently in an early phase , and limited resources are a main challenge .\ndapeca - data has promising potential to virtually complete the follow - up of its patient population .\nall penile cancer patients included in dapeca - data can be followed until death or emigration by means of data linkage to the danish civil registration system .\nan ongoing effort aims to facilitate automated follow - up prompts to appear at the relevant administrator in order to enter the follow - up data continuously .\nif this system fails to be implemented , the database will be updated in relation to specific studies with retrieval and addition of relevant data from records and registers via danish civil registration system .\nthe group behind the dapeca - data is active within the research field and publishes regularly on the topic;2,812 however , no research paper as of yet has used data registered in the dapeca - data due to the rarity of the disease and the fact that the database was only established in june 2011 .\n, dapeca - data has annually released a report with analyses of the clinical quality indicators ( table 3 ) .\nhowever , results and data presented in the annual reports from the initial development years should be interpreted with reservation and caution . as reflected by the most recent annual reports\n, data validity and completeness has been improving over time , but validation and algorithm optimization is only progressing slowly at the current level of support and funding .\nthe dapeca - data is administered in the two centers , such as copenhagen university hospital and aarhus university hospital , responsible for staging and treatment of the patients .\nvalidation lists of all patients with the diagnosis within the uptake area of the specific center are presented to the database administrators every 3 months .\ndata are entered into an internet - based online user interface with integrated range validation by treating clinicians .\ndata are linked to each patient s unique ten - digit civil personal registration number .\nthe database steering committee consists of clinicians and academic experts representing urology , oncology , and pathology and continuously updates and specifies the quality indicators and the contents of the data profile ensuring a clinically meaningful and realistic dataset .\nthe database receives a limited amount of funding from public sources via the danish regions and is independent from private funding .\ndapeca - data is under the auspices of the danish multidisciplinary cancer groups ( dmcg.dk ) , which is an umbrella organization comprising 24 national cancer groups and clinical databases in denmark .\nthe urological cancer groups and databases are further organized under the subgroup for danish urological cancer groups .\nthe dapeca -

{"id": 91, "text": "knee osteoarthritis ( oa ) is the most common degenerative joint disorder in the elderly and a major public health problem throughout the world .\nit is the leading cause of pain and is estimated to be the fourth leading cause of disability among the aging population.1 it increases the risks of morbidity because of loss of functional capacity , including difficulty in walking , inability to perform self - care , transferring , and going up and down stairs .\nknee oa not only impairs physical functions but also reduces quality of life.2 in addition , it is the third leading cause of life - years lost due to disability.3 the prevalence of oa is increasing rapidly.4 its prevalence among asian countries ranges from 38.1% to 46.8%.57 in thailand , there was a survey among elderly in the community aged more than 50 years using history of knee pain and x - ray finding .\nit was found that the prevalence of knee oa ranged from 34.5% to 45.6%.8 concerning pharmacologic treatment , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are the most common prescription for pain relief in oa.9 unfortunately , some patients can not use nsaids due to their adverse effects ( aes ) on the gastrointestinal ( gi ) system , including dyspepsia , ulceration , upper gi bleeding , and perforation of the stomach or duodenum.1012 curcumin is a spice commonly used for a long time as a coloring agent ( yellow ) in many kinds of curry powder in thai food .\nevidence from in vitro studies revealed that curcumin has an inhibitory effect on substances involved in the inflammatory pathway , including lipoxygenase , cyclooxygenase ( cox ) , phospholipase , collagenase , elastase , and hyaluronidase.1316 furthermore , curcumin was found to inhibit the activation of free radical activated transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa b and nitric oxide synthase.13 it also reduces the proinflammatory cytokines : eg , tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin ( il)-1 beta , il-8 , and matrix metalloproteinase-13.17,18 all of these substances have a major role in the inflammatory joint process .\njackson et al19 reported that curcumin strongly inhibited collagenase and stromelysin expression , suggesting its therapeutic potential for the treatment of arthritis . concerning safety profiles ,\ncurcumin was demonstrated to be safe , even after high - dose ingestion of up to 8,000 mg / day for 3 months.20,21 nowadays , there is scarce information from clinical trials of curcumin in patients with knee oa . in 2009\n, we performed a single - blind randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of 2,000 mg / day of curcuma domestica extracts compared with 800 mg / day of ibuprofen in 107 knee oa patients for 6 weeks.22 there were some limitations in that study , including inadequate sample size , subtherapeutic dosage of ibuprofen ( 800 mg per day ) , a single - blinded assessor , and the unequal frequency of drug intake between the two groups .\nwe decided to conduct this multicenter study with better design : ie , double - blind randomized controlled trial using a lower dosage of curcumin with a shortened duration to 4 weeks , in order to determine the efficacy and safety of 1,500 mg / day of c. domestica extracts in pain reduction and functional improvement compared with 1,200 mg / day of ibuprofen .\nthe study protocol was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles stated in the most recent version of the declaration of helsinki . after receiving approval from the institutional review board of eight tertiary hospitals in thailand , including four hospitals in the central , one in the northern , one in the northeastern , and two in the southern regions of thailand\nthe inclusion criteria were primary knee oa patients according to the american rheumatism association criteria23 who had a numerical rating scale of knee pain of 5 out of 10 and age 50 years . patients who had abnormal liver function or renal function , history of peptic ulcer , allergy to curcumin or ibuprofen , or\nthe randomization number was generated by computerized method , and the allocation codes were serially concealed in opaque envelops . after being recruited into the study , every subject received a knee x -

group comparison showed no differences in womac scores ( p=0.326 , p=0.531 , p=0.522 , and p=0.278 for womac total , womac pain , womac stiffness , and womac function subscales , respectively ) . concerning the effectiveness of c. domestica extracts in this study ,\nthe mean , standard deviation , and difference values ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] ) of womac total score , womac pain , womac stiffness , and womac function subscales at week 4 are presented in table 2 .\nall of the womac scores in the c. domestica extracts group seemed to be more than those in the ibuprofen group .\nhowever , after using the noninferiority test , the mean difference ( 95% ci ) of the womac total , womac pain , and womac function subscales at week 4 adjusted by week 0 of the c. domestica extracts group was within 0.5 point , which means that the c. domestica extracts group was noninferior to the ibuprofen group ( p=0.010 , p=0.018 , and p=0.010 , respectively ) , whereas the womac stiffness subscale showed a trend toward significance ( p=0.060 ) .\nin addition , the 6-minute walk distance at week 4 was approximately 350 meters , which was no different between the groups ( mean difference and 95% ci were 7.18 meters and 7.01 to 21.38 meters ) .\nin addition , the number of subjects with ae occurring during the study was no different between the two groups ( 35.7% in ibuprofen vs 29.7% in the c. domestica extracts group , p=0.222 , table 3 ) .\ncommon aes were dyspepsia , abdominal pain / distension , nausea , loose stool , and pitting edema .\nfor the numbers of events that occurred , the rate of abdominal pain / distension was significantly lower in the c. domestica extracts group than in the ibuprofen group ( 10.8% vs 18.1% , p=0.046 ) .\nhowever , the rates of dyspepsia , nausea , and pitting edema were higher in the ibuprofen group than in the c. domestica extracts group ( 15.9% vs 11.4% for dyspepsia , 8.2% vs 4.9% for nausea , and 7.1% vs 3.8% for pitting edema ) , but none of these events reached statistical significance .\nonly the symptom of loose stool was higher in the c. domestica extracts group than in the ibuprofen group , also with no difference ( 11.9% vs 8.8% , p=0.330 ) .\nthere was no difference in drug compliance between the groups ( 93.8% vs 92.6% in the ibuprofen and c. domestica extracts groups , respectively , p=0.202 ) .\nconcerning the rescue drug , two ( 1.1% ) and five ( 2.7% ) patients in the ibuprofen group and the c. domestica extracts group used tramadol , but no significant difference was found ( p=0.449 ) .\nthe patients global assessment and satisfaction at week 4 also was no different between groups ( p=0.665 and p=0.707 , respectively ) .\nmost subjects ( 96%97% ) were satisfied with the treatment , and two - thirds of them rated themselves as improved in a global assessment ( table 4 ) .\nin the past decade , evidence in vitro has revealed the efficacy of curcumin in many aspects , including anti - inflammatory,20,27 antioxidant,28 and anticarcinogenic.2931 we were interested in its anti - inflammatory effect because some patients with knee oa are unable to use nsaids due to their gastrointestinal aes.1012 the mechanism of anti - inflammatory activity of curcumin extracts was demonstrated by the inhibition of many different substances that play a major role in inflammation , including phospholipase , lipoxygenase , cox-2 , leukotrienes , thromboxane , prostaglandins , collagenase , elastase , hyaluronidase , tumor necrosis factor- , il-1 , il-8 , and il-12.1317 in addition , henrotin et al32 found that diferuloylmethane ( the active ingredient of curcumin ) protects chondrocytes by inhibiting il-1 , activator protein-1/nuclear factor kappa b , and matrix metalloproteinase-3 and preventing chondrocyte apoptosis .\nlev - ari et al33 reported an in vitro study of curcumin with cox-2 anti - inflammatory agents that showed that it can inhibit cox by reducing prostaglandin e2 level .\nmilan , italy ) 1,000 mg per day ( containing curcumin 200 mg / day ) combined with nsaids or analgesic drugs for 8 months in 100 knee oa patients with kellgren \nthey found that it could significantly improve womac scores and walking distance only in the study group .\nhowever , their study used a low dose of curcumin in combination with nsaids , not a head - to - head comparison between curcumin and nsaids as in our study .\nin addition , subjects in their study were young with a mean age of 44 years and mild severity of knee oa ( x - ray grading i  ii )\nanother study from india reported a comparative trial concerning the efficacy of ra-11 ( artrex , mendar ; bioved pharmaceuticals , inc .\n, pune , india ) , the multiplant ayuravej drug that is composed of withania somnifera , boswellia serrata , zingiber officinale , and curcuma longa , in 90 patients with knee oa.35 subjects were randomized to have ra-11 or placebo for 32 weeks .\ntheir results were that knee pain score and womac score significantly decreased ( p,0.05 , p,0.01 ) only in the study group .\nthis study was different from ours because it used a mixture of drugs and compared with placebo , whereas we chose curcuminoid extracts and compared with an active controlled drug ( ibuprofen ) .\na study from thailand carried out by pinsornsak and niempoog36 in 2012 performed a randomized control trial of the efficacy of 1,000 mg / day of c. longa extract as an adjuvant therapy of diclofenac ( 75 mg / day ) for 3 months in 88 primary knees with oa .\nthey found no statistical significance between groups in visual analog scale for pain and functions evaluated by knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score.37 that means that c. longa extract does not add more benefit for subjects than those receiving only diclofenac . from our previous study in 2009 , even though there was a trend toward a greater effect in patients receiving c. domestica extracts , we could not definitely conclude that c. domestica extracts were as effective as ibuprofen , because the upper limit of the 95% ci of mean difference in the pain score exceeded the prespecified equivalence limit ( one point ) .\nthis study adjusted some of the methodology to correct those flaws : ie , the frequency and dosage of c. domestica extracts and ibuprofen ( 1,500 mg / d vs 1,200 mg / d , respectively , divided into three times per day ) , the double - blinded controlled trial , and shortening the duration of drug intake from 6 weeks to 4 weeks due to the better trend of outcomes at week 4 from our previous study.22 in addition , for precision of outcomes , we chose the narrow range of difference ( 0.5 point ) in main outcome after treatment , and we used the t - test for noninferiority to determine effect between groups .\none thing that we have concern about is the dosage of ibuprofen used in the active controlled group . even though ibuprofen at a higher dosage of 1,800 mg per day can be expected to have higher tissue distribution , decrease proinflammatory synovial fluid cytokine levels , and provide better control of knee symptoms , as reported by gallelli et al,38,39 we still chose a daily dose of 1,200 mg ibuprofen in this study .\nthe reasons were that thai people have a lower average body weight compared with caucasians , and our rheumatologist suggested a daily dosage of 8001,200 mg of ibuprofen in daily practice .\nmoreover , a higher dosage would increase risk of gi ae , especially melena , as presented in this study .\nfinally , our results show that the mean differences of all womac scores of the c. domestica group ( except stiffness subscale ) were noninferior to the ibuprofen group , and those values were within a prespecified range of noninferiority limit ( 0.5 point ) .\ntherefore , we can conclude that c. domestica extracts were as efficacious as ibuprofen in pain reduction and functional improvement . for safety concerns , c. domestica extracts showed safety profiles better than ibuprofen in terms of abdominal pain / distension .\nin addition , seven patients in the ibuprofen group were lost to follow - up due to aes , as compared with one patient in the c. domestica extracts group .\ncheng et al21 reported that c. domestica extracts can be provided at 2,000 mg / d for 6 weeks or an even higher dose of up to 8,000 mg / d for 3 months without any serious aes .\nmoreover , the compliance rate of both drugs in this study was more than 90% .\npatients global assessment of improvement was approximately 64% in both groups , and more than 95% of both groups were satisfied with the treatment outcomes .\nthe ae profile was similar but with fewer gi ae reports in the c. domestica extracts group ."}
{"id": 92, "text": "it is an honor to review and comment on an article written by my dear friend jerry mcandrews .\none would think that , in more than 20 years , some of the issues of concern that mcandrews addressed should have been resolved or at least ameliorated to some degree .\nwhen it comes to discussions about  chiropractic philosophy  or should i correctly say  philosophy of chiropractic ,  there seems to be no limit to the time required for dogma to disappear and credible information to take its place .\nit is imperative that we develop a new understanding for how to build the bridge between philosophy and practice .\nthere can be no theory without new data to drive ongoing investigation , as well as no theory without a hypothesis to build upon . yet when it comes to relating to what constitutes the philosophy of chiropractic , we often believe in things without being able to disprove them .\nthus , knowledge transfer to the profession is more difficult than anyone could have possibly realized .\nmcandrews lamented that the distortion of what constituted philosophy that was being taught and perpetuated would thwart most efforts to truly understand the importance of philosophy and its applicability .\nthe following are my reflections on his article titled  the knowledge of our knowledge ,  and i offer suggestions for the chiropractic profession to consider as we continue to look at these issues .\nno better quote could be proffered to discuss this topic than the words of co watkins , dc , who exhorted us to be  bold in what we hypothesize , but cautious and humble in what we claim !  this admonition may be one of the fundamental reasons for how and why the philosophical divide continues to exist .\nthe proponents of the limited approach to patient care ( limited to only the detection of subluxation ) suggest that , if one understands \nchiropractic philosophy ,  this understanding negates the need to do research and scientifically investigate these claims .\ndetractors on the other end of the spectrum , those who oppose this limited viewpoint , might go so far as to require scientific evidence and validation a priori for everything done in practice , which is neither reasonable nor realistic .\nit would appear that somewhere in the middle lies a position that is valid and achievable .\nmcandrews opines in his 1991 article that the meanings of the term philosophy are not well understood by the profession and , thus , this misunderstanding has enabled distortions and improper contexts to contribute to a philosophical divide .\nthe term and its multidefinitions have been polarizing to the profession to a point of creating a paralysis of forward movement .\nthe vitalistic and the mechanistic coalitions fight against each other ; and until there is a greater effort to test the testable and untestable components , the battles will likely continue . in 2012 ,\nthe issues regarding educational qualifications , research validity , and professional authority become extremely confusing when many of the issues being debated within the chiropractic community are not  philosophy  per se but are unfortunately linked to , or confused with , philosophy .\nemotional tirades fill our publications , with disagreements ranging from opposing or supporting a modernized council on chiropractic education standard of accreditation to whether to oppose or support the use of additional modalities ( expanded state statutory authority to use prescription drugs ) .\nthe debate continues over the use of a professional lexicon that has no universal agreement by all participants .\nfor example , mandating the incorporation of , or eliminating , the term subluxation to describe the profession generates a volatile reaction bordering on blasphemy by a segment of the profession .\nconversely , defining the chiropractic profession to include primary care physicians or chiropractic physicians brings about an equally intransigent position to another faction .\nthe list of disputed issues and the emotional temperature on both sides of the conflicting debate(s ) appear to have no limits , and all exist under the banner of difference of chiropractic  philosophy .  chiropractic has always faced a challenging conundrum regarding how it will be perceived by those within the profession and from powerful forces outside the profession . on one hand , there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the contention that health care must focus on health and well - being rather than simply attempting to find a cure in a pill .\nthe metaphysical belief system in and of itself has provided divisiveness by an underlying construct that suggests that these beliefs can not be scientifically validated .\nthis contention only provides food to fuel the allegation and appearance that cult - like dogma is in play .\nthe very act of holding oneself , or a profession , immune from critique creates the very foundation for ritual and dogma . as wartfosky stated , \nmetaphysics , in introducing the conceptual models as an articulate , explicit object of criticism , represents the way back to a critique of the foundations of understanding .\n when a metaphysic holds itself immune from a critique then it degenerates into non metaphysical ritual and dogma . \nthus , as a profession , we must overcome these urges to  hold ourselves immune  and instead allow ourselves to critique our foundations .\nthe chiropractic profession has made previous attempts to investigate the principles of chiropractic . in the prior decades\n, research was focused on double - blind controlled trials , which were perhaps not the most appropriate model for chiropractic research . moving away from that model was difficult because controlled trials were considered the criterion standard and chiropractic researchers wanted to engage in credible research .\nthis research void included both sides of the profession : those supporting the assertion and those repudiating the hypothesis . in fairness ,\nvalid research is expensive ; and there was limited access to research funding to engage in trials of the magnitude that would provide meaningful data .\nhowever , this does not excuse the lack of focus by the profession in attempting to research these essential questions .\nclaims had to be supported by a footnote reference to its source and hypothesis required challenge by expecting claims to be submitted to refereed journals . \nyet even when attempts are made to potentially test the validity of the  subluxation syndrome ,  there is ridicule from scientific communities and confusion within the chiropractic profession .\nunsubstantiated claims that subluxations influence organ systems , and therefore adjustments can effect a cure to these systems , continue to be proclaimed and yet remain largely unsupported by scientific inquiries that test these questions .\nthis is a contentious yet important differentiation between the pragmatic practitioner and the chiropractic scientist .\npractitioners witnessing the daily benefits of providing spinal adjustments / manual manipulation to their patients never stop to ask the question that the chiropractic scientist does :  is the subluxation clinically relevant ?  this view is questioned from diametrically polar ends of a spectrum and provides the fertile ground to generate the ongoing seeds of discord because of misunderstanding rather than provide insight and clarity .\nsubluxation is an unchallenged notion for many in the chiropractic profession and is recognized as such by various chiropractic leaders .\nmcandrews rightly viewed the philosophy of the science of chiropractic as referring to the explanation of the science of chiropractic .\nscience is ever developing ( and thus changing ) , so also does the philosophy of chiropractic develop ( change ) with it .\nthe two not only go hand in hand with each other , they essentially are each other .\n maybe if we can approach science and philosophy in this manner , we would be able to reach beyond our differences .\nas we enter the second decade of the 21st century , we are still challenged to understand fully that the fundamental hypothesis of chiropractic has not yet been satisfactorily resolved .\nthe health care environment continues to evolve , and other professions may be moving into areas that we once thought were ours alone . a wave of  new medicine  theories and advancements has made the distinction between chiropractic and other healing methods more challenging .\npronouncements from biomedicine state that treating the body alone is not enough ; the mind can also play a critical role in the healing process .\nmedical physicians appear to be embracing a more holistic form of health care , seeking to heal the whole person .\ntreatments once considered fringe , including visualization , meditation , and hypnosis , are being prescribed alongside high - tech western medicine .\nno other profession has been so aggressively attacked by medicine than chiropractic , which has always integrated  holistic  approaches to health . throughout these decades of vicious attacks ,\nthe chiropractic profession was the leading alternative health care group to provide an alternative philosophy of health .\nchiropractic has developed different concepts of health care : the role of the provider , the role of the healer , and ultimately the health care encounter itself .\nwe have the potential to contribute to the philosophy of health and to change the health care paradigm from disease focused to wellness .\nhowever , in doing so , we must profess our knowledge based upon evidence and not emotion .\nfor the chiropractic profession to advance , it is imperative that unsupported claims be eliminated from our paradigm .\nchiropractic and the theories espoused for many decades appear to be gaining credibility and validity .\n. we must be ready to accept the results of these investigations and either build upon that body of research or accept the findings and move in alternative directions that science will take us .\nin doing so , we will contribute to the philosophy of health and perhaps help change a paradigm from disease to wellness based upon evidence and not emotion .\nperhaps then the  knowledge of our knowledge  will be understood : mcandrews would be proud ."}
{"id": 93, "text": "\n among electrical stimulation methods , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tdcs ) is the most well - known noninvasive technique for shaping neuroplasticity in humans [ 15 ] .\nmuch of the evidence for the neuronal effects of tdcs can be based on physiological studies both in man and in animals . in particular , measuring the amplitude of motor evoked potentials ( meps ) allows easy quantification of excitability changes induced by tdcs , however , only at the primary motor cortex ( m1 ) .\nbesides tdcs , it was shown that transcranial random noise stimulation ( trns ) , in a range either between 0.1  hz and 640  hz or between 100 and 640  hz , is a similarly effective technique for increasing cortical excitability , however , circumventing the directional sensitivity of standard tdcs . using magnetic stimulation , apart from high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rtms ) , intermittent theta burst stimulation ( itbs )   is regarded as the most time - efficient effective technique in order to increase cortical excitability .\nso far in all paradigms the duration and the magnitude of the after - effects were controlled by varying stimulation duration , type , or intensity [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 811 ] , nevertheless always in different subjects populations .\nwhile the subject - to - subject variability using different methods can be high , the aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of different transcranial stimulation methods that are supposed to increase cortical excitability , in the same subject population .\ntwelve subjects ( age : 25.7  4.1 years ; range : 2338 years ) participated in this study .\nall subjects were right - handed , according to the short version of the edinburgh handedness inventory , and they were naive with regard to the aim of the study .\nthose who were ill , were pregnant , were suffering from drug abuse , or had metallic implants / implanted electrical devices were excluded by an interview .\nnone of them took any medication acting on the central nervous system or had a history of a neurological and psychiatric disease .\nthe experimental procedures conformed to the declaration of helsinki and were all approved by the ethics committee of the university of gttingen .\nsubjects and the investigator , who made the mep measurements , were blinded for stimulation conditions in all of the studies .\natdcs and trns at 1  ma intensity were delivered by a battery - driven electrical stimulator ( version dc - stimulator - plus , neuroconn gmbh , ilmenau , germany ) through conductive - rubber electrodes placed in two saline - soaked sponges . with regard to tdcs\nthe random numbers were normally distributed ; the probability density function followed a bell - shaped curve . in the frequency spectrum ,\nthe noise signal contained all frequencies up to half of the sampling rate , that is , a maximum of 640  hz .\nfor both atdcs and trns , the current was ramped up and down over the first and last 5  s of stimulation .\nthe size of the stimulation electrode over the left m1 was 4  4  cm and of the reference electrode 6  14  cm , which was placed over the contralateral orbit ; both were fixed on the head by elastic bands .\nthe position of the stimulation electrode was determined prior to stimulation by single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation ( tms ) . for sham stimulation ,\ntbs was applied over the cortical representation field of the right first dorsal interosseous ( fdi ) muscle and was delivered using a magstim super rapid stimulator . the tbs pattern consisted of bursts containing 3 pulses at 50  hz repeated at 5  hz and an intensity of 80% the active motor threshold ( amt ) .\nfor itbs , a 2  s train of tbs was repeated every 10  s for a total of 190  s ( 600 pulses ) .\namt was the minimum intensity needed to elicit an mep response of 200300 v during moderate spontaneous background muscle activity ( 15% of the maximum muscle strength ) in at least three of six consecutive trials . to examine changes in corticospinal excitability ,\nmeps of the right fdi were recorded following stimulation of its motor - cortical representation field by single - pulse tms .\nthese were induced using a magstim 200 magnetic stimulator ( magstim company , whiteland , wales , uk ) with a figure - of - eight standard double magnetic coil ( diameter of one winding , 70  mm ; peak magnetic field , 2.2  t ; average inductance , 16.35  h ) .\nsurface electromyogram ( emg ) was recorded from the right fdi through a pair of ag - agcl surface electrodes in a belly - tendon montage .\nraw signals were amplified , band - pass filtered ( 2  hz2  khz ; sampling rate , 5  khz ) , digitized with a micro 1401 ad converter ( cambridge electronic design , cambridge , uk ) controlled by signal software ( cambridge electronic design , version 2.13 ) , and stored on a personal computer for offline analysis .\ncomplete relaxation was controlled through visual feedback of emg activity , and whenever it was necessary , the subject was instructed to relax .\nthe coil was held tangentially to the skull , with the handle pointing backwards and laterally at 45 from the midline , resulting in a posterior - anterior direction of current flow in the brain .\nsingle - pulse meps were recorded with the tms intensity adjusted to elicit 1  mv peak - to - peak amplitude at baseline .\nthe site was marked with a skin marker to ensure that the coil was held in the correct position throughout the experiment .\nthe order of the stimulation conditions with regard to all experiments occurred in a counterbalanced fashion , with at least 5 days between two measurements .\nstimulus intensities ( in percentage of maximal stimulator output ) of tms were determined at the beginning of each experiment . immediately following stimulation ,\n40 single test - pulse meps were recorded at 0.25  hz , that is , approximately 0  min , 5  min , and 10  min after stimulation and then every 10 minutes up to 60  min and then again at 90  min . a repeated measure of analysis of variance ( anova ) ( a given current condition versus sham  time points of mep recordings ; dependent variable : mean amplitude of meps ) was calculated . if a significant main effect of stimulation or the interaction of time and stimulation occurred , a fisher lsd test was performed .\npearson correlation coefficients were calculated in order to see if there is a correlation with regard to the cortical excitability changes induced by the different stimulation methods . in each subject at every single time point , the effects of two methods ( atdcs versus trns , atdcs versus itbs , and trns versus itbs ) were pairwise compared .\nno side effects were reported by the subjects after any of the experimental sessions . the average baseline mep values were 1.00  0.02  mv for atdcs , 0.96  0.02 for the trns condition , 1.01  0.02 for itbs , and 0.98  0.02 for the sham condition obtained by 44  2.78% , 43.6  2.65% , 44.6  2.85% , and 44  2.86% of maximum stimulator output , respectively ( mean  sem ) .\namt values ranged between 23 and 40% of mso ( mean  sd 29.7  4.9 ) .\nthere were no correlations between the amt values and the induced cortical excitability change with regard to any of the stimulation conditions . as expected , both atdcs and full spectrum trns applied over the m1 using 10  min stimulation duration and 1  ma intensity showed the classical behaviour and induced excitability increase .\na similar pattern was seen by itbs . with regard to atdcs , repeated measurement of anova revealed significant main effects of stimulation ( f1.11 = 32.5 ; p = 0.0001 ) .\ntime ( f9.99 = 0.83 ; p = 0.6 ) and the interaction between stimulation and time were not significant ( f9.99 = 0.96 ; p = 0.5 ) .\nfisher lsd test showed significantly higher mep amplitudes at each time point , compared to sham ( p < 0.05 ) .\nstudent 's t - test demonstrated significantly increased meps between 10 and 60 minutes compared to baseline ( p < 0.05 ) , except at 20 minutes ( figure 1 ) .\nconcerning trns , repeated measures anova revealed significant main effects of stimulation ( f1.11 = 10.7 ; p = 0.007 ) and time ( f9.99 = 3.13 ; p = 0.002 ) .\nthe interaction between stimulation and time was also significant ( f9.99 = 2.99 ; p = 0.003 ) .\nfisher lsd test showed significantly higher mep amplitudes at each time point between 0 and 60  min , compared to sham ( p < 0.05 ) .\nstudent 's t - test demonstrated significantly increased meps between 5 and 60 minutes compared to baseline ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ) . with regard to itbs\n, repeated measures anova revealed significant main effects of stimulation ( f1.11 = 17.9 ; p = 0.001 ) and time ( f9.99 = 2.57 ; p = 0.01 ) .\nthe interaction between stimulation and time was also significant ( f9.99 = 2.87 ; p = 0.005 ) .\nfisher lsd test showed significantly higher mep amplitudes between 0 and 40 minutes at each time point , compared to sham ( p < 0.05 ) .\nstudent 's t - test demonstrated significantly increased meps between 0 and 40 minutes compared to baseline ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 1 ) . comparing all of the active stimulation conditions\n, there were no significant main effects of interactions ( table 1 , figure 2 ) .\ncomparing the three active and one sham stimulation conditions , there was a main effect of stimulation ( f3.33 = 6.44 ; p < 0.05 ) .\nafter the pairwise comparisons of the individual data at every single time point between two methods ( atdcs versus trns , atdcs versus itbs , and trns versus itbs ) , we found no significant correlations between the increases of cortical excitability induced by the different stimulation methods , except between atdcs and itbs at 10  min after stimulation ( pearson correlation coefficient = 0.71 ; p = 0.005 ) .\nthe aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of three widely applied stimulation methods inducing excitability enhancement in the m1 .\nwe have used 10 min atdcs , 10  min trns at 1  ma intensity , and 3 min itbs to compare the efficacy of these methods , because for stimulating the m1 these are the most frequently used stimulation durations .\nnevertheless , the final effects of noninvasive brain stimulation methods depend on a lengthy list of parameters ( e.g. , frequency , temporal characteristics , intensity , geometric configuration of the coil / electrode , and current direction ) , when it is delivered before ( offline ) or during ( online ) the task as part of the experimental procedure ( for reviews , see , e.g. , [ 5 , 18 ] ) .\nthere were significant augmentations of the excitability caused by all three types of active stimulations compared to sham stimulation , with slightly different time courses .\ntrns resulted in the strongest ( in mep amplitude increase ) and significantly longest mep increase compared to sham .\non the physiological level ( e.g. , mep measurements ) or on the behavioural level ( e.g. , reaction time and performance measures ) , different transcranial stimulation methods might show comparable effects with regard to the direction and the magnitude of the excitability or behavioral changes [ 11 , 19 ] .\nfor example , both atdcs and trns over m1 resulted in mep increase using the same stimulation parameters and electrode sizes in a partly overlapping population , both applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlpfc ) impaired performance in a categorization task   in a parallel group design .\nnevertheless , opposite results were also observed : tested in the same subjects , atdcs over the left dlpfc improved working memory performance , while trns had no effect . applied over the primary visual cortex , anodal stimulation had no effect on perceptual learning while high frequency trns improved it , again in a parallel group design .\nsimilar results were observed in a visuomotor learning task when the stimulation was applied over the m1 .\nthe partly contradictory results are explained by methodological differences ( different stimulation parameters with regard to the duration and intensity of the intervention ; electrode montage that results in different current flow in the brain ; time of the stimulation : during versus before task ) and anatomical and physiological differences ( variances in the number of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in a given cortical area , orientation of the axons with regard to the current flow , and different concentration of neurotransmitters ) .\nimportantly , the results obtained within the motor system are not always equivalent to the results obtained in the visual system or other areas [ 25 , 26 ] .\nfurthermore , considering the varying time courses of the applied stimulation methods suggests that the assumption of different mechanisms of actions is likely .\nlong - term tdcs effects are not observed after administration of an nmda receptor antagonist or blocking na channels [ 27 , 28 ] .\ntrns might induce temporal summation of small depolarizing currents , which could interact with the activity of the engaged neurons .\noriginally ,   it was suggested that trns augments sodium channels activity . of course , after a short depolarization , repolarization of sodium channels would take time ; with repeated stimulation these channels can be reopened with an asymmetrical time course .\ntrns is a noisy stimulation and noise in the nonlinear systems enhances performance through stochastic resonance . in case of anodal tdcs membrane polarization\nprobably induces a sustained depolarization with inactivation of voltage - dependent channels . with regard to the technical application in healthy and clinical populations , trns\nhas the advantage of higher cutaneous perception thresholds and lower response rates when compared with atdcs .\nconcerning itbs , the mechanism of the pulsatile stimulation might be completely different although pharmacological studies have demonstrated that the after - effects of itbs at least partially also depend on nmda receptor activity .\nthe nmda receptor antagonist memantine blocked the after - effects of itbs in healthy subjects , whereas placebo did not show a significant effect .\nnevertheless , the durations of the after - effects are definitely shorter induced by itbs , compared to atdcs .\nfurthermore , there is evidence to suggest that neuroplastic responses to different nbs protocols might be due to activation of different populations of synapses .\nboth atdcs and trns , as well as itbs , produce cortical excitability changes over time .\nhowever , atdcs / trns application is distinctly cheaper since it can be performed with a small low - priced battery - driven portable stimulator , also suitable , for example , for home use .\nfurthermore , since it produces less acoustic noise , skin sensation , like itching or tingling , or muscle twitching , it is more suitable for double - blind , sham - controlled studies and for clinical applications . in summary , in this study , we compared the magnitude of after - effects of different excitatory transcranial stimulation methods tested in the same healthy subjects and found that trns resulted in the strongest and significantly longest mep increase compared to sham . between the types of active stimulation , there was no significant difference ."}

4 ] . of these complications ,\ntesticular swelling and pain occurs 10 days after the onset of parotitis in 15 to 40% of males with mumps viral infection ; however , these symptoms can occur up to 6 weeks after the onset of parotitis .\nthe mumps virus damages the testicular tissue as a result of parenchymal edema . as a result ,\ntesticular atrophy is reported to occur in 30 to 50% of affected testicles and subfertility occurs in an estimated 13% of patients .\nalthough there have been several reports examining the resurgence in mumps , there have been few studies of the characteristics of postpubertal mumps and mumps orchitis in patients after mmr vaccination .\n.   reported on an outbreak of mumps in vaccinated males , but they did not include a description of mumps orchitis . to our knowledge , this is the first report describing postpubertal mumps orchitis in vaccinated korean males .\nfrom january 2005 to december 2010 , 62 patients diagnosed with acute mumps orchitis were treated at korea university medical center . it was confirmed by questionnaire that all patients had been vaccinated with the mmr vaccine under the national vaccination system of the korean center for disease control .\npatients who did not receive vaccination or had an unknown vaccination history were excluded from our study .\ndiagnostic criteria for mumps orchitis were complaints of testicular pain , swelling , and tenderness on palpation during the acute illness stage and serologic confirmation of acute mumps infection ( positive immunoglobulin [ ig ] m with negative or positive igg ) .\nmumps - specific igm and igg were detected by using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit ( vircell , granada , spain ) .\noptical density value above 1.1 were considered positive , those below 0.9 were considered negative , and those between 0.9 and 1.1 were considered indeterminate .\nthe patients ' previous history of mumps and vaccination status was obtained from the patients or their parents by questionnaire or telephone survey .\nthe characteristics of the clinical manifestations , such as incubation period , febrile duration , mean duration of orchitis , and hospital stay , were investigated .\nother general symptoms , such as pyrexia , headache , and malaise , were reviewed through medical records .\nlaboratory findings such as serologic markers ( white blood cell counts [ wbcs ] , c - reactive protein [ crp ] , amylase , and lipase ) and urine analysis with urine culture were assessed .\nsonographic findings of mumps orchitis , such as the degree of testicular swelling , bilaterality , and direction , were also investigated .\nthe clinical features in our patients were compared with the features of previous reports of unvaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis identified through literature review .\nsearched reports were limited to studies that investigated more than 10 patients with unvaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis .\npatients were admitted to the hospital unless their general status allowed them to be treated as outpatients .\nall patients were treated with bed rest , elevation of the scrotum , local cooling ( ice bag ) , and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or antipyretics ( acetaminophen ) .\nthe mean age of the 62 patients was 17.56 years ( range , 15 to 29 years ) .\nit was confirmed by questionnaire that all patients had been vaccinated with the mmr vaccine under the national vaccination system of the korean center for disease control .\na total of 56 patients ( 90.3% ) had been in contact with a mumps - infected case .\nall patients were serologically confirmed to have an acute mumps infection ( positive igm with negative or positive igg ) and were hospitalized for supportive treatment .\nall 62 serum samples obtained at admission were positive for mumps igm antibodies , whereas 36 ( 58.1% ) were positive for igg antibodies ( table 1 ) .\nthe mean incubation period was 5.39 days ( range , 0 to 23 days ) , the mean duration of fever was 1.8 days ( range , 0.5 to 3 days ) , the mean duration of orchitis was 4.96 days ( range , 0 to 17 days ) , and the mean hospital stay was 4.88 days ( range , 0 to 10 days ) . with regard to general symptoms , fever was observed in 46 patients ( 74.2% ) , headache in 34 patients ( 54.8% ) , and myalgia in 32 patients ( 51.6% ) . also , 56 patients ( 90.3% ) had parotitis before the appearance of acute orchitis .\nthe mean wbc level was not elevated in any patients ( 8,396/l ; normal range , 4500 to 11,000/l ) , whereas the mean crp level was increased over the normal range ( 24.18 mg / dl ; normal range , 0 to 5 mg / dl ) , and the mean amylase level was 406.08 iu / l ( normal range , 28 to 100 iu / l ) ( table 1 ) .\nscrotal ultrasonography revealed testicular swelling of > 20 ml in 17 patients ( 27.4% ) , between 15 and 20 ml in 12 patients ( 19.4% ) , and < 15 ml in 33 patients ( 53.2% ) ( table 3 ) .\nbilateral orchitis was present in 4 patients ( 6.4% ) , and 58 patients ( 93.6% ) had unilateral orchitis .\nright - sided orchitis was present in 31 patients ( 50% ) , and left - sided orchitis was noted in 27 patients ( 43.5% ) ( table 2 ) .\nmeningitis was present in 5 patients ( 8% ) , but there were no other complications , including pancreatitis ( table 3 ) . to compare the clinical features observed in our study with those of cases of unvaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis\n, we reviewed the literature and found four articles that investigated more than 10 patients with unvaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis .\nthe mean duration of fever was shorter ( 1.8 days ) in the population of our study than in unvaccinated patients ( 3.5 days ) , and the incidence of bilateral orchitis was lower in our study .\nhowever , the mean incubation period , the length of orchitis , and the length of hospital stay did not differ significantly from that in the previous reports ( table 4 ) .\ncomplications such as meningoencephalitis , pancreatitis , and oophoritis or orchitis have been observed in up to 42% of patients with mumps . in the past\n, populations not receiving the mmr vaccine clustered in large groups in secondary schools and colleges .\nhowever , the incidence of mumps has been reduced by high coverage with effective vaccines .\nhowever , recent mumps outbreaks have been reported continuously worldwide , even in vaccinated children .\nimmunization programs against mumps have influenced the age distribution , and recent outbreaks have mainly affected adolescents and young adults .\nsince the introduction of the mumps vaccine in 1967 ( the year the first mumps vaccine was licensed in the united states ) , a shift in the age of peak incidence of mumps from children aged 5 to 9 years in the prevaccine era to children and young adults aged 10 to 24 years has been observed .\nthis shift in the age at the appearance of mumps [ 13 - 16 ] from children to young adults means a shift toward a period during which the development of mumps complications , such as orchitis , is more frequent . as a result\n, there has been a resurgence in mumps orchitis , with epidemics being reported more frequently . however , to our knowledge , there have been no reports about the clinical features of postpubertal mumps orchitis in patients who have received the mmr vaccine .\nour survey revealed that all study patients had previously received the mmr vaccination in accordance with korean national immunization programs .\nmost patients with mumps orchitis are hospitalized because of high fever and severe testicular pain .\nfevers are frequent in mumps orchitis , although leukocytosis or pyuria are not evident in most patients .\nthey reported that the interval between the initiation of treatment and the disappearance of fever averaged 3.6 days with antiinflammatory drugs administered for an average of 8.6 days .\nin other studies , the mean duration of fever was about 2 to 5.4 days [ 10,11,14,15,18 - 23 ] . in our study , the mean duration of fever was relatively shorter ( 1.9 days ) , although treatment , including bed rest , scrotal support , local cooling , and antiinflammatory drugs , did not differ from other reports .\nwe found that the febrile duration was relatively shorter in vaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis patients than in unvaccinated mumps orchitis patients .\nin particular , testicular swelling can lead to a rise in intratesticular pressure followed by testicular atrophy .\nku et al .   measured the testicular volume of 21 patients with acute mumps orchitis and found a mean testicular volume of 18.1 to 19.2 ml . in the same study , 8 of the 44 measured testes ( 18.2% ) reached a volume of 25 ml .\nmeasured the testicular volume in 12 patients with acute mumps orchitis , and the mean volume of the affected testicles by ultrasound was 18.5 ml . in another series of 11 patients with acute mumps orchitis , the volumes of the affected testes ranged between 15.2 and 47.5 mm ( mean , 27.2 mm ) . in our study , the volumes of the affected testes in 33 patients ( 53.2% ) were smaller than 15 ml , and severe enlargement of the testis ( > 25 ml ) was observed in only 7 patients ( 11.3% ) .\nwe think these results may lead to a lower incidence of testicular atrophy and subfertility , but unfortunately , we did not investigate the development of testicular atrophy and subfertility in this study .\nmumps orchitis is generally unilateral , but occurs bilaterally in 15 to 30% of patients . in unvaccinated postpubertal males , casella et al .  \nreported that 18% of unvaccinated postpubertal males suffered bilateral mumps orchitis , and ternavasio - de la vega et al .   reported the incidence of bilateral orchitis to be two times higher in young adults than in adolescents ( 29% vs. 13% , respectively )\n. however , bilateral orchitis was present in only four ( 6.4% ) of the vaccinated postpubertal patients in our study .\nour findings indicate that the clinical manifestations of mumps orchitis in vaccinated postpubertal males are milder than in unvaccinated patients .\nthe duration of fever was shorter , the incidence of severe testicular swelling was lower , and the incidence of bilateral orchitis was also lower compared with mumps orchitis in unvaccinated postpubertal males .\nthere have been no reports explaining the difference in clinical features of mumps orchitis in vaccinated postpubertal males .\npark et al .   reported that the level of igg titers and the avidity index in vaccinated unaffected patients were not significantly different from those in patients with a past infection .\nalternatively , the low igg avidity index of the vaccinated unaffected group may represent a qualitative limitation of vaccine - induced humoral immunity in mumps ; that is , failure to induce sufficiently mature antibodies , resulting in secondary vaccine failure .\nalthough recently vaccinated patients have a lower igg avidity , their igg avidity level will be higher than that in unvaccinated males .\ntherefore , the symptoms and the duration of fever may be less severe in these patients than the symptoms of mumps orchitis in unvaccinated males .\nthe limited short - term follow - up period is the main limitation of this study .\nlong - term follow - up is needed to investigate the complications of mumps orchitis , such as testicular atrophy or subfertility . also , it is necessary to carry out more research involving comparisons with unvaccinated patients .\nin addition , more effort should be directed toward determining the mechanism underlying the reemergence of mumps and mumps orchitis , and an additional booster vaccination should be developed .\nas shown in our study , the clinical manifestations of mumps orchitis in postpubertal vaccinated patients include a relatively shorter febrile duration , less scrotal swelling , and a low incidence of bilateral orchitis compared with unvaccinated patients .\nadditional long - term follow - up and large prospective studies are needed to determine ways to prevent outbreaks of mumps and mumps orchitis , and an additional booster vaccination should be considered ."}

based diseases by identifying regression in imt values after such interventions.813 imt measurement methods have become more complex since the initial reports .\nthe necessity of same - patient serial measurements in prospective cohort studies demanded a homogenization of the technique in order to avoid differences between repeated exams due to technical reproducibility difficulties as opposed to real imt changes .\nhowever , complex models require longer examination periods , are more expensive , and require auxiliary devices and additional human resources . the objective of this study was to test and describe a practical protocol to measure common carotid imt that uses the combined values of two longitudinal examination angles to increase its sensitivity .\nbetween february and september 2005 , 210 patients underwent duplex scan examination of carotid vessels at our institution . generally , the indication for carotid investigation was the occurrence of a neurological event ( stroke , tia , or both ) , assessment of cardiovascular status in patients with risk factors for atherosclerosis , and preoperative evaluation for vascular surgeries .\nthe remaining 206 patients were evaluated in a cross - sectional study where conventional carotid and vertebral duplex investigation was complimented by imt measurements taken from both common carotid arteries ( cca ) , except in five cases due to unilateral cca occlusion .\nall examinations were performed by a single physician with certified skills in duplex scan diagnostic procedures .\nthe exams were initially performed with an atl hdi 1500 ultrasound system ( phillips medical systems , bothel , wa , usa ) using a 1012 mhz linear transducer . in the latter included patients ,\na logiq 5 ultrasound system ( ge healthcare , milwaukee , wi , usa ) and a 710 mhz linear transducer were used .\nimt measurements were obtained with the patient lying in the supine position and with the neck rotated to the opposite side of examination .\ncca images were obtained to measure imt by using three different angle views for each vessel ( figure 1 ) .\ninitially , a transversal scanning view of the acc was performed in the longest extension possible from the base of the neck to the carotid bulb .\nat least three imt points were measured in the near and far walls in the most thickened area of each vessel .\nalso , lateral wall measurements were taken when both thickening was evident and accurate images were possible .\nsubsequently , the vessel was scanned by two longitudinal views : posterolateral ( pl ) , with the transducer positioned parallel to the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle , and anterolateral ( al ) , with the transducer positioned parallel to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle ; at least three imt measurements were obtained for each near and far wall .\noptimal b -

effective method for assessing systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk in adults.1 also , is somewhat easy to provide specific training for professionals with previous vascular ultrasound experience to take imt measurements that meet good quality standards after a short period of practice.14 in this study , we proposed an objective and practical method to evaluate imt with the intention of improving the measurement quality by a short increase in the time required for carotid examination while maintaining its characteristic simplicity .\nspecific software1620 has been developed for automatic imt evaluation that minimizes the subjectivity of direct eye observation .\ncomputer - assisted imt measurements are widely used in other countries for longitudinal cohort studies and are encouraged by latest consensus.2122 however , such an option demands complex human and material resources . although software can perform more than a hundred measurements from each segment in a short time , the results obtained were not proven to be more accurate than manual measurements.23 another improvement is the concomitant use of ecg24 during examination , which allows the observer to take measurements only during systolic activity , preventing small differences that could appear during the diastolic period when the inner arterial layers are less compressed .\nalso , external devices that measure head rotation and transducer position in degrees , such as the meijer arc , make it possible to reproduce the same positions in repeated examinations .\nthese improvements bring many advantages and raise the quality of the data obtained , but such procedures also require more time24 and are more expensive .\nthe application of such protocols should be preceded by a careful cost - benefit analysis that depends on the objectives of each investigation .\nonly the sternocleidomastoid and the carotid bulb were used , which represent simple anatomical references that remain virtually unchanged over time .\nthe transversal angle view provided a panoramic observation of the cca , thus allowing the observer to identify and measure the thickest imt points , even of the side walls .\nhowever , measurements taken from the transversal view may result in poor quality images , which are subject to many artifacts that are mainly the result of refraction from the side walls . rather than being a proper measurement angle ,\nprevious authors have performed imt measurements from a single longitudinal view,14,2526 which can provide limited observation of the vessel walls , leading to the underestimation of early atherosclerotic processes .\nwe avoided directly comparing our findings with these reports due to the methodological differences of each study .\ninstead , we used the numbers obtained in our investigation to compare the combined results of imt measured from the two longitudinal views with results from each single longitudinal view .\nas shown in the results , isolated longitudinal views had poorer sensitivity on identifying areas of increased imt .\nthe longitudinal views obtained in this investigation provided at least 12 different measurement points ( three from each wall ) , covering the whole extension of the cca in perpendicular angles to generate virtual tri - dimensional information about carotid wall thickness .\nalthough some authors believe that the near wall images are not accurate enough for imt measurements,2728 we decided to consider these values . in many cases , the near wall presents layers that are far thicker than those in the far wall , which may even have normal values .\nthus , ignoring these findings would underestimate the real state of the carotid artery atherosclerotic process.2930 recent studies revealed a tendency to use the mean maximum thickness of the cca , carotid bulbs , and internal carotid artery ( ica).31 in this investigation , we avoided taking measurements from the carotid bulb or ica for the following reasons : first , even though bulb and ica measurements may be worthwhile , they present limitations : as opposed to cca , they can be measured only in limited angles that may not reflect the thickest portions of vessel wall.3233 also , up to 52% of images can fail to obtain accurate bulb and ica measurements.34 the variance of results of bulb and ica imt amongst repeated examinations and different physicians is higher than cca measurements , making longitudinal comparisons more unreliable.3537 finally , cca , bulb , and ica have morphological differences that make direct imt comparison among them inaccurate.21 yet , cca / bulb / ica measurements do not appear to be superior to cca imt alone.38 we believe that the suggested protocol is an inexpensive method to measure imt .\nwe avoided expressing costs in numbers because values may vary from country to country and from private to public healthcare models .\nthus , the eventual cost calculation in our institution may not reflect the reality for many readers .\nalthough we did not show numbers to confirm our impression , we judged that the presented technique is less expensive because it does not uses complimentary devices and does not depend on external software to analyze the obtained images .\nthe acquisition and maintenance of the necessary devices would certainly impact the final costs of examinations .\nthe mean time expended in taking all measurements was about 8 minutes . this value is shorter than other models suggested,24 thus representing less of an impact in terms of physician human resources than more complex models .\nthe protocol presented is a fast and practical method for obtaining common carotid artery intima - media thickness measurements .\nthe combined values of anterolateral and posterolateral longitudinal views provide a more sensitive evaluation of the inner layers of the carotid walls than isolated longitudinal views ."}

acetaldehyde 6 with cyanamide 2 could lead , via 2-aminooxazole 1 and 2-aminothiazole 7 , to ribonucleotides and 2-deoxyribonucleotides , by desulfurization of c2 \n ( scheme 2 ) .\nthe importance of 2-aminothiazole 7 , and its derivatives , \n has been recognized in medicinal chemistry , but though the synthesis of thiazole 7 in water has \n been reported , the potential relevance \n of thiazole 7 to the origins of life remains unexplored . \n\nthe formation of oxazole 1 from cyanamide 2 and glycolaldehyde 3 at neutral ph requires stoichiometric \n ( or excess ) cyanamide 2 and general acid \naldehyde 6 , upon \n imine formation with cyanamide 2 , has , like 3 , the potential to undergo 5-exo - dig cyclization \n to furnish imine 14 ( or hemiaminal 15 ) as \n shown in scheme 3 .\nfurthermore , we expected \n the reaction to proceed more rapidly at neutral ph and be less prone \n to stall at intermediates en route to thiazole 7 due \n to the increased nucleophilicity of sulfur and greater aromaticity \n of thiazoles with respect to oxazoles . to test this supposition , \n -mercapto - acetaldehyde 6 ( 8.5 mm ) and 2 ( 15 , 26 , or 50 mm ) were incubated in \n d2o at pd 7 and 20 c and a rapid ( ca\n. 10 min ) quantitative \n conversion of aldehyde 6 to hemiaminal 15 was observed ( see the supporting information \n figure s1 ) .\nover the course of several hours , 15 dehydrated to furnish thiazole 7 ( see supporting information figures s2 and s3 ) .\nit is of note that excess aldehyde 6 did not \n lead to further reaction of thiazole 7 .\nmoreover , at \n elevated concentration ( > 150 mm ) 2-aminothiazole 7 was \n observed to directly crystallize from water , and a crystal structure \n of thiazole 7 is shown in scheme 3 .\nnext we investigated the concomitant synthesis \n of oxazole 1 and thiazole 7 . in the presence \n of excess cyanamide 2\n( 2.25 equiv ) , rapid and \n stoichiometric conversion of glycolaldehyde 3 ( 1 equiv ) \n and -mercapto - acetaldehyde 6 ( 1 equiv ) to hemiaminals 11 and 15 , respectively , was observed in water . \n at high ph / pd ( ph / pd\n> 9 ) specific base catalysis or in 1 m phosphate \n solution ( ph / pd 6.57.5 ) general acid  base catalysis \n furnish oxazole 1 and thiazole 7 over the \n course of 2436 h at ambient temperature ( scheme 3 ; see supporting information figure \n s8s10 ) . at neutral pd , selective \n dehydration of 15 to liberate thiazole 7 was observed .\nlimiting cyanamide 2 ( 2/3/6  0.8:1:1 ) also resulted in the specific \n generation of thiazole 7 , even in 1 m phosphate solution \n ( ph 7 ; see supporting information figure \n s9 ) .\nit is likely that the rapid 5-exo - dig cyclization \n of imine 12/ hemiaminal 13 leads to the \n selective sequestration of cyanamide 2 in thiazole 7 .\nwe did not observe significant homo- and hetero - aldol \n reaction \n during the reaction of glycolaldehyde 3 and mercaptoacetaldehyde 6 with either excess or limiting cyanamide 2 between \n ambient temperature and 60 c in 1 m phosphate solution at ph \n 7 .\ninterestingly , we also found that , like oxazole 1 , \n thiazole 7 is easily sublimed ( see supporting information figure s4 ) , suggesting possible geochemical \n routes to the distribution , separation , and purification of thiazole 7 under abiotically plausible conditions . sublimation from \n a mixture of oxazole 1 and thiazole 7 resulted \n in the isolation of both azoles as colorless crystalline solids .\npartial \n sublimation of a mixture of oxazole 1 and thiazole 7 ( 1:1 ) resulted in the isolation 4:12:1 oxazole 1/thiazole 7 , at 50 c between 1 and 24 \n h at ambient pressure , indicating the more rapid but comparable sublimation \n rate of oxazole 1 relative to thiazole 7 .\ncomplete sublimation was observed after 2 d at 60 c to afford \n 1:1 mixture of crystalline azoles at ambient pressure .\nwe then examined the multicomponent reaction of thiazole 7 , 4-amino - imidazole 5-carboxamide 16 , and a series of aldehydes .\nequimolar quantities of thiazole 7 and aliphatic aldehydes \n ( including formaldehyde , acetaldehyde , propionaldehyde , and cyclobutaldehyde ) \n with excess amino - imidazole 16 ( 1.23 equiv ) furnished \n high yields ( 7590% ) of thiazolines 17 , 18 , 19 , and 20 , respectively , at \n ph 5 .\nthe multicomponent reactions were found to be robust at multi - gram \n scale and comparable diastereoselectivity was observed in the reaction \n of aliphatic aldehydes with oxazole 1 or thiazole 7 and amino - imidazole 16 ( via imine 21 r = alkyl ; d.r.= 2.5:14:1 threo / erythro ) .\ncompounds 17 , threo-18 and erythro-18 , and the major isomers of 19 and 20 were isolated by fractional crystallization , and the crystal \n structures are shown in scheme 4 . to continue our investigation into the potential \n of multicomponent \n assembly of nucleotides we studied the participation of thiazole 7 in carbon \ncarbon bond - forming reaction with -hydroxyaldehydes \n and imines derived from -hydroxyaldehydes in water .\nincubation of equimolar aldehyde 3 , 2-aminothiazole 7 , and amino - imidazole 16 for 5 d in water at ph 46 at 20 c gave a high yield \n of c4-thiazoline 23 ( 80% isolated yield ) as \n 1.2:1 erythro / threo mixture of diastereomeric \n products .\nsurprisingly , this signified that the facial selectivity \n of thiazole 7 is significantly relaxed with respect to \n oxazole 1 and imine 21 ( r = ch2oh ) .\nhowever , both erythro-23 and threo-23 were formed with complete annulation \n control ( > 99% , see h nmr spectrum shown in supporting information figure s28 ; single crystal \n x - ray structures of erythro-23 and threo-23 are shown in scheme 5 ) . upon investigation of \n the parallel mcr with the c3-synthon \n glyceraldehyde 22 , comparable efficiency in the synthesis \n of c5-thiazoline 24 ( 70% isolated yield ) was \n observed .\nagain , exclusive 6-exo - trig annulation \n is observed ; however , in this case , 24 is furnished with \n significant diastereoselectivity ( d.r.= 9:5:1.1:1 , see scheme 5 and supporting information figure s35 ) .\nisolation of the two major isomers , crystallization , \n and x - ray diffraction proved their xylo- and lyxo - configuration .\nthe diastereoselectivity \n obtained , upon carbon  carbon bond formation is proposed to \n result from intramolecular hydrogen - bonding and concomitant steric \n impedance of thiazole addition to the si - face of \n imine 21 ( see supporting information scheme s1 ) . although the facial selectivity \n of the nucleophile 7 has been relaxed with respect to \n the comparable reaction of 1 , the facial \n selectivity of the glyceraldehyde - imine 21 ( r = ch2oh ) is retained .\nthis is important \n with respect to purine nucleotide synthesis by 3-purine tethering , \n which necessarily requires n3-displacement and c3-inversion . \n\nfurthermore , as well as regiospecific tethering of 16 and consequent delivery of n1 to the anomeric carbon atom , reaction \n of thiazole 7 with imine 21 regiospecifically \n delivers sulfur to c2 , which is of significant interest with \n regards to the potential synthesis of 2-deoxynucleotides by \n c2-desulfurization .\nthe multicomponent tricyclic thiazoline products 1724 were uncontaminated with homoaldolization \n and homo - mannich byproducts .\nadditionally , oxazole 1 is \n known to react efficiently with -hydroxyaldehydes in a ph - dependent \n bimolecular domino - reaction . in striking \n contrast ,\ncarbon bond formation was observed \n by h nmr analysis upon incubation of thiazole 7 with either glycolaldehyde 3 or rac - glyceraldehdye 22 in d2o ( pd 39 , \n 4100 c ) . instead , over a period of 4 days at pd 7 ,\ncrystal \n formation was observed from an aqueous solution containing 3 ( 100 mm ) and thiazole 7 ( 100 mm ) at 20 c .\nsingle crystal x - ray diffraction of a crystal \n isolated directly from the reaction supernatant proved that the structure \n was aminal 25 ( scheme 6 ) .\nthough nmr studies confirmed that rac-22 formed hemiaminal 26 and \n aminal 27 with \n thiazole 7 in d2o , no aminal crystallization \n was observed in solutions of rac-22 and 7 , even at significantly elevated concentrations ( 500 mm to \n 2 m ) or with substoichiometric quantities of rac-22 . to test whether the change in solubility properties was \n due to the increased number of hydroxyl moieties or perhaps due to \n the differential solubility and packing properties of rac-27 with respect to the achiral aminal 25 , we investigated the solubility properties of the aminal structures \n formed in a mixture of d - glyceraldehyde 22 and \n thiazole 7 .\nintriguingly , we found that at 100 mm concentration , d-27 now crystallized from water at 20 c . \n\nnmr analysis showed a 1:2 ratio of 22/7 and \n recrystallization ( 10:1 h2o / etoh ) allowed for crystallographic \n confirmation of the aminal structure ( scheme 6 ) .\nin summary , our results suggest that in a sulfur - rich \n prebiotic \n environment , oxazole 1 and thiazole 7 could \n be formed together under the same conditions , as long as both glycolaldehyde 3 and its thiol analogue , -mercapto - acetaldehyde 6 , were present along with cyanamide 2 . in such \n mixed reactions ,\nthe absence of any interference \n between oxazole and thiazole synthesis shows that these potential \n precursors of deoxynucleotides and ribonucleotides could indeed be \n formed at the same time in the same conditions .\nwe have also found \n that two abiotically plausible methods for the purification of oxazole 1 , namely , crystallization and sublimation , also apply to \n thiazole 7 .\nhowever , the chemical reactivities of oxazole 1 and thiazole 7 are quite different , suggesting \n that the subsequent pathways would diverge .\nthe most striking \n difference between the reactivity of oxazole 1 and thiazole 7 is the failure of the thiazole \n to react with aldehydes to form the thiazoline precursors of the ( thio)pyrimidine \n nucleotides .\nthe most likely explanation for this difference is the \n increased aromaticity of the thiazole relative to the oxazole , and \n thus decreased nucleophilicity of c5 .\nwe are currently investigating \n an alternative synthesis of 2-deoxyribo - pyrimidine nucleotides \n mediated by c2-inversion of anhydronucleotide 28 ( scheme 1 ) .\nhowever , during \n the course of efforts to observe two - component reactivity of thiazole 7 with aldehydes , we observed instead the crystallization \n of glycolaldehyde 3 and homochiral ( but not racemic ) \n glyceraldehyde 22 ( two known ribonucleotide precursors ) as aminals directly from water .\nthe facile reversibility of aminal \n formation suggests that the chemical sequestration and protection \n of c2- and c3-aldehyde nucleotide synthons by \n another important class of nucleotide synthon ( azoles ) may have provided \n a route to the concentration , purification , and stabilization of the \n necessary aldehyde precursors of nucleotides .\nalthough these aldehydes \n can in principle be readily synthesized by a variety of routes , their high reactivity has until now made it difficult to conceive \n of means for accumulating large reservoirs of these essential starting \n materials in a prebiotic context . by exploring the multicomponent \n reactivity of thiazole 7 , together with aldehydes and \n the purine precursor amino - imidazole 16 , we have demonstrated \n a selective and high yielding 3-component \n carbon  carbon bond - forming reaction that chemospecifically \n furnishes masked-2-thiosugars regiospecifically tethered to \n an amino - imidazole purine - precursor .\nthe facial selectivity of thiazole 7 , upon addition to -hydroxyaldehyde - imines , is quite \n relaxed ( relative to oxazole 1 ) , resulting in low diastereoselectivity \n at c2 ; however , this is inconsequential with regards to the \n proposed deoxynucleotide synthesis because c2 would be rendered \n achiral following desulfurization .\nin contrast , we observed very high \n diastereoselectivity of nucleophilic addition of thiazole 7 to imine 21 , generating almost exclusively the lyxo and xylo isomers with controlled n9c1 \n annulation .\nthe conversion of the resulting c5-thiazolines \n to 2-deoxyribo - purine nucleotides requires three additional \n steps : c3-inversion to release the purine - precursor from its \n tethered attachment to c3 , completion of the purine heterocycle , \n and chemospecific desulfurization of c2. these steps are currently under investigation in our laboratories \n as part of our continuing studies aimed at the abiotic synthesis of \n 2-deoxyribonucleotides .\nfinally , it is of note that if life emerged in an environment containing \n both ribo- and 2-deoxyribonucleotides , it is likely that the \n first biopolymers were heterogeneous in composition , that is , composed \n of a mixture of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides , and perhaps other \n compatible nucleotides .\nrecent work has shown that functional biopolymers , \n in the form of aptamers with highly specific molecular recognition \n properties , can be derived by in vitro evolution from libraries of \n polynucleotides composed of randomly interspersed ribo- and deoxyribo - nucleotides . thus , chimeric rna / dna polymers may have been \n sufficient for the emergence of life .\nthe primordial biochemical exploitation \n of a mixed rna and dna genetic system could eliminate the requirement \n for a genetic takeover ( of rna by dna ) , and would arguably result \n in a simplification of the transition from chemistry to biology\n. however , \n such mixed - composition polymers have neither the advantageous stability \n of dna , nor the optimal functional characteristics of rna .\nthus , rna \n and dna may have emerged as early and contemporaneous specializations \n of a primitive mixed biopolymer .\nreagents and solvents were purchased \n from sigma -

{"id": 102, "text": "actinomycosis is an uncommon chronic granulomatous disease that presents as a slowly progressive , indolent , indurated infiltration with multiple abscesses , fistulas , and sinuses .\nthe purpose of this article is to report on a case of actinomycosis with clinical findings similar to periodontitis .\na 46-year - old female presented with recurrent throbbing pain on the right first and second molar of the mandible three weeks after root planing .\nexploratory flap surgery was performed , and the bluish - gray tissue fragment found in the interproximal area between the two molars was sent for histopathology .\nthe patient did not report any symptoms , and she is scheduled for a follow - up visit .\nactinomycosis should be included in the differential diagnosis in cases with periodontal pain and inflammation that do not respond to nonsurgical treatment for periodontitis .\nmore routine submissions of tissue removed from the oral cavity for biopsies may be beneficial for differential diagnosis .\nactinomycosis is an uncommon , indolent , slowly progressive infection caused by anaerobic or microaerophilic bacteria that normally colonize the mouth , colon , and vagina .\nactinomycosis occurs rarely in humans , but occurs more frequently in cattle as a disease called lumpy jaw .\nit often presents as a slowly progressive , indolent , indurated infiltration with multiple abscesses , fistulas , and sinuses .\nfour clinical forms of actinomycosis account for most of these human infections : the cervicofacial , thoracic , abdominopelvic , and cerebral .\nactinomyces exist in normal oral flora , and they can be found in calculus , periodontal pockets , carious lesions , and oral mucosal surfaces .\nthe bacteria do not cause any pathology as long as they stay on the surface of the mucosa , but they become pathogenic and can initiate a prolonged chronic inflammatory process if the integrity of the mucosal barrier is compromised and access to the oral tissues or jawbones is gained .\nactinomycosis of the jaws and oral tissues has been considered for a long time to be a rare disease ; therefore , it has not generated much interest in research .\nother types of actinomycosis in oral tissues , such as periapical actinomycosis , are relatively well documented in the literature , but reports of actinomycosis with clinical and radiographic findings similar to periodontitis are limited . one case has been reported of a regional alveolar bone actinomycosis with a related juvenile - periodontitis - like lesion .\na patient was diagnosed with actinomycosis without abscess formation or desquamation based on a biopsy during a periodontal flap procedure .\nthis article reports a case of actinomycosis - mimicking periodontitis , and provides a review of the literature related to actinomycosis .\na 46-year - old female was referred to the department of periodontics of seoul st .\nmary 's hospital ( seoul , korea ) for treatment of chronic periodontitis , particularly in the mandibular molar area ( fig .\n1 ) . she complained of throbbing pain on the right first and second molars of the mandible .\nthe patient 's medical and dental histories were taken , and clinical assessments and examination , including probing depths , tooth mobility , and bleeding on probing , were performed .\nthe patient was a nonsmoker and went to the department of cardiology of seoul st .\nmary 's hospital for rheumatic mitral insufficiency ; she had been taking an anticoagulant ( warfarin , 2 mg cuparin tablets ; hana pharm co. , seoul , korea ) for 3 years .\nintraoral examination revealed generalized chronic periodontitis and particularly deep probing pocket depths : 7 to 8 mm on the distal area of the left second molar , right first molar , and right second molar of the mandible .\nher cardiologist was consulted for operability , and the cardiologist recommended continuing anticoagulant therapy . the initial cause - related therapy consisted of thorough full - mouth scaling and root planing in the quadrants under local anesthesia .\nthree weeks after her final root planing treatment , she made an unscheduled visit to the clinic .\nshe complained of recurrence of throbbing pain on the right first molar of the mandible .\nthe right first and second molars of the mandible had positive responses for percussion , cold , and electric pulp testing .\nshe complained of an unusual throbbing pain , which was relieved when she bit tightly .\nthe probing pocket depth of the distal area on the right first molar was 7 mm .\nthe right first and second molars of the mandible had positive responses for percussion , cold , and electric pulp testing .\na sulcular incision was made around the right posterior teeth of the mandible to preserve the papillae , and the mucoperiosteal buccal and lingual access flaps were elevated ( fig .\n2 ) . granulation tissue adherent to the teeth and the alveolar bone was removed . a round , hard , floating , bluish - gray fragment in the interproximal area between the right first and second molar of the mandible was seen .\nthe resulting interproximal crater defect was filled with a xenograft bone material ( bio - oss , geistlich pharma ag , wolhusen , switzerland ) .\nan analgesic ( 300 mg acetaminophen , 300 mg endapen tablet ; chodang pharm co. , seoul , korea ) at 3 times a day , and an antimicrobial drug ( 625 mg amoxicillin with clavulanate , 625 mg moxicle tablet ; daewoong co. , seoul , korea ) , 3 times a day , were prescribed for 5 days .\nthe patient was also instructed to abstain from brushing and flossing around the surgical area for 2 weeks , to use a 0.1% chlorhexidine ( hexamedine solution , bukwang pharm co. , seoul , korea ) solution rinse , and to consume a diet of soft food until suture removal .\nthe follow - up visits after the surgical procedure were scheduled for each week of the first month after surgery .\nthe mass removed from the interproximal alveolar bone was stored in 10% formalin , and was sent to the department of pathology of seoul st .\nfive days after biopsy , the pathologist concluded that the fragment was aggregates of bacterial colonies and needed a special stain for diagnosis .\nafter one week , the results of the gram , silver , and periodic acid - schiff ( pas ) stain were positive , and the differential diagnosis was actinomycosis ( figs\nthe actinomycotic aggregate presented an isolated mass of bacterial filaments in the center and periphery , the so - called sun - ray effect ( figs . 4 and 5 ) .\nthe healing was uneventful , and the patient reported mild discomfort , but was satisfied with the absence of throbbing pain . based on the histologic result , the patient was prescribed to continue taking amoxicillin and clavulanate ( 625 mg three times a day for 4 weeks ) .\nthe patient was monitored weekly for the first month and then monthly for four months .\nthe patient did not report any symptoms , and she is now scheduled for ongoing follow - up .\na previous case reported on an adult patient who presented with periodontitis with a diffuse and atypical actinomycotic lesion that was limited to the gingiva and had an abscess formation , a large desquamation , and subsequent exposure of the alveolar bone in the involved region .\nactinomyces colonies can be identified using hematoxylin - eosin , gram , pas stains , and silver stain , exhibiting filamentous morphology with color variation between the center and periphery .\nthe colonies have a basophilic center with eosinophilic rays terminating in pear - shaped clubs , the so - called sun - ray effect . in this case , gram , pas , and silver stains were performed , and the results were positive .\ninfection by actinomyces may initiate complications , which may not be diagnosed correctly unless the tissue is biopsied and the actinomyces colonies are identified . in the clinical practice of periodontology ,\ntissue is not routinely submitted for histopathologic analysis , and the authors would like to suggest more routine submissions of tissue removed from the oral cavity , especially during the treatment of periodontal disease .\nmoreover , due to the opportunistic characteristics of the actinomycotic infection , early and adequate differential diagnosis of actinomycosis , prior to attempts at therapy and management steps , is of great importance in the oral cavity because it can prevent the spread of the disease . in a previous report , the majority of cases of actinomycosis were asymptomatic , with only 18% presenting symptoms such as pain and sensory disturbances ( 80% and 20% of the symptomatic cases , respectively ) . in this case , the patient had a recurrence of throbbing pain .\nactinomycotic patients have often been afflicted by more than one medical condition . won et al .   have described actinomycosis as an opportunistic infection , suggesting cancer , immunodeficiency steroids taken over a long period of time , and malnutrition as possible contributing factors . however , most of the actinomycotic patients from the indian subcontinent have been systemically healthy\n. extended antimicrobial therapy has been recommended for patients with any clinical form of actinomycosis to prevent disease recrudescence . however , individualization of therapy is recommended whether the duration of antibiotics depends on the initial burden of disease , the site of infection , or the clinical and radiological response to treatment .\nactinomyces are sensitive to a number of antibiotics , and penicillin is the drug of choice for treating an infection caused by any of the actinomyces . in this report , the combination of penicillin ( amoxicillin ) and a beta -

{"id": 104, "text": "in 1994 , franklin and mathew   recognized that cardiac arrests in hospitals are often preceded by prolonged physiologic deteriorations .\nthese deteriorations not only presage patient deaths but they also offer an opportunity to recognize the crisis and trigger interventions that might be life saving . since then , medical emergency team ( met ) responses have been described by many authors , most notably several groups from australia . although there are no randomized clinical trials showing benefit from introduction of mets , many single center reports [ 2 - 4 ] support the notion that timely intervention may interrupt crisis events and decrease unexpected hospital mortality . as a result of these reports and of the potential for improved outcomes they offer ,\norganizations such as the institute for healthcare improvement and the society for critical care medicine have been promoting rapid response teams and mets . in north america and in europe , there now appears to be a rapid increase in number of organizations that have implemented a met program , following a trend set in australia .\nthe medical literature is now rapidly growing as well , but it has been focused almost exclusively on either the benefits of mets in terms of reducing unexpected mortality or on the processes impacted on by mets ( e.g. improved detection of process errors ) .\nwhat has not occurred is a characterization of the met patient ; for example , who is at risk , and what conditions and settings are dangerous ? in other words , we do not understand the epidemiology of the met patient .\nthe syndrome(s ) could be related to patient physiology during a dangerous time in their illness ; perhaps each disease entity has an at - risk time for developing a medical crisis requiring a met if no action is taken to prevent it . on the other hand , the met patient may be instead a symptom of a hospital in crisis . in other words ,\nthe met patient may be created by the environment and not the disease . to be sure\n, being ' sick ' is a prerequisite for a met , but at least one review of met events seems to support the conclusion that mets prevent death because they intercept ' system ' errors that lead to cardiac arrest .\nfuture analyses of met events may provide the answer to the question , are hospitals sick ? jones and colleagues , in their report in this issue of critical care , provide an early clue with their epidemiologic analysis of met events .\nthey describe data to support a commonly suspected association between time of day and the incidence of crisis recognition in hospitals .\ntheir review of over 2000 events revealed an increase in events at certain times of the day , notably near nursing handoffs and physician rounding . their data ,\nalthough observational , strongly suggest a ' sick hospital ' syndrome . although it is possible that subsets of their patient population all happened to deteriorate\na diurnal pattern for physiologic deteriorations would be unexpected , given the diverse causation of met events .\na more reasonable explanation for the observation is that the more care givers that visit a patient , the more likely they are to detect patient deteriorations .\nalthough jones and his coauthors describe an increase in the number of events during ' off hours ' as noted in their fig .\n2 , their fig . 1 tells a different story ; the hourly rate of met events is lower during the off hours .\ninstead , they may accumulate , only to be found at the end , or beginning , of work shifts or during scheduled visits .\nif the findings of jones and coworkers are correct , then the conclusion one must draw is that hospitals may have a design flaw  they do not reliably find patients who are exhibiting clinical deterioration .\nan alternative hypothesis is that met calls increase during daylight hours because of an increase in inappropriate met activations .\njones and co - authors describe their findings in a hospital with a long history of met responses . it is doubtful that their findings are the result of inadequately trained staff ( and inappropriate activations of the met ) . their hospital has overcome two of the biggest obstacles to met implementation : teaching staff to recognize crisis and motivating staff to call for help when they find one .\nthey have developed crisis criteria and created mnemonic tools such as pocket cards and wall posters .\nthey have created a culture that rewards those who utilize the met system , and a culture that reliably recognizes and utilizes a standardized response to crisis .\neven so , there is evidence in the report that workers at night are unable to find the crisis as frequently as are staff during the day .\nif other authors corroborate these findings , then the inescapable conclusion will be that hospitals do not reliably find patients in crisis , which is an obviously dangerous situation . to respond to this finding ,\nhospitals need some form of improved detection system , involving increased staffing , more frequent visits , or more frequent use of monitoring , perhaps in every hospitalized patient .\nit is unlikely that staffing will increase because of cost considerations , although a work redesign is possible .\nhowever , it is obvious that care givers can not remain with patients all the time .\nthe alternative , continuous monitoring of all hospitalized patients ( e.g. with pulse oximetry ) is less expensive and may be life saving .\nif continuous monitoring detects crisis situations better , then one would expect the diurnal variation curve to flatten out , and it would prove to be a remedy to the sick hospital syndrome . a third option is to study rigorously the met syndrome and apply findings by better selection of patient monitoring . in any case ,\n. a met response addresses one half of the need  it is a process to save reliably those patients who are in crisis .\nour challenge is to create an around - the - clock system that efficiently finds deteriorating patients ."}

treated sites .\nthe possible explanation could be due to non - exposure of the barrier membrane following placement in any of the test sites .\nthis would have prevented undue exposure of the barrier to oral environment , thereby preventing infection or soft - tissue inflammation , which would lead to faster resorption of membrane and cause recession .\nin contrast , studies by cortellini and becker et al . in 1996 have shown that sites treated with gtr have increased amount of recession between 1.8 and 2 mm .\nhas postulated that the greater the degree of gingival recession , shorter the root surface area that is provided for the repopulation of the periodontal ligament cells thereby negatively influences new attachment formation .\nnew bone formation is frequently used as a primary outcome variable in controlled clinical trials of regenerative therapy .\nradiographic monitoring of alveolar bone changes following regenerative procedures is a non - invasive painless alternative to direct bone measurement .\nmost of the alveolar bone changes following regenerative therapy of intrabony defects occur in the intrabony component while crestal resorption may be minimal or may not occur at all . in our study ,\nno significant change in the level of the alveolar crest was seen in both test and control groups after 6 and 9 months .\nwhere in 0.33 mm of crestal resorption was noted in gtr - treated sites . there was a significant difference in defect depth from baseline to 9 months in test and control groups ( p < 0.05 ) while an inter group comparison did not show any significant differences in defect depth .\nsimilarly , no significant difference was found in percentage of df both within and between the groups [ table 2 and figures 611 ] .\nthis observation is in accordance to the findings by gottlow et al . in 1986 , becker et al . in 1993 , and micheal et al . in 2000 . in our study ,\nconventional radiography with image analysis software ( auto cad 2007 ) was used to assess radiographic parameters as applicability and reliability of the image analysis system in alveolar bone measurement have been studied previously by micheal , hausmann et al . , and verdonschot et al .\nhowever , advanced radiographic techniques like subtraction digital radiography remain the method of choice if subtle changes in mineralization of alveolar bone need to be detected .\nradiograph of test site at baseline in relation to 46 and 47 radiograph of control site at baseline in relation to 36 and 37 radiograph of test site at 6 months in relation to 46 and 47 radiograph of control site at 6 months in relation to 36 and 37 radiograph of test site at 9 months in relation to 46 and 47 radiograph of control site at 9 months in relation to 36 and 37 the gtr material utilized in this study is an orange - brown color type - i fish collagen .\nit is available in dimensions of 1  1 cm and 1  2 cm and can be easily manipulated and adapted to the root surface .\nthe largest concentration of collagen is found in the skeleton , fins , skin , and air bladder .\nuse of this barrier in our study did not show any case reporting with any form of allergy or hypersensitivity reaction .\nthe results of the study is difficult to compare due to a number of possible differences like in small sample size , study design , patient / defect selection , percentage of one / two / three wall defect components , baseline depth of defects , probing forces , and evaluation method .\nhence , the regenerative potential and beneficial effects of this gtr membrane should be further evaluated with larger sample size , longer follow ups , use of advanced radiographic aids ( like cone - beam - computed tomography , etc . ) and with combination therapy involving bone grafts .\nwithin the limits of the study , it can be inferred that no significant differences were found either by using a collagen membrane of fish origin or open flap debridement in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects both clinically and radiographically ."}
{"id": 106, "text": "growth regulation is a critical developmental process whose dysfunction can lead to many diseases , including cancer ( conlon and raff , 1999 ) .\nthe salvador ( sav)/warts ( wts)/hippo ( hpo ) ( swh ) network , identified in drosophila and conserved in mammals , plays a major role in limiting growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis ( harvey and tapon , 2007 ; reddy and irvine , 2008 ) .\nactivation of the upstream kinase hpo allows it to phosphorylate the downstream kinase wts , which in turn phosphorylates and inhibits the transcription coactivator yorkie ( yki ) .\nscaffold proteins , such as salvador ( sav ) and mats , potentiate the activity of the hpo / wts complex ( harvey and tapon , 2007 ) .\none upstream input of the pathway is mediated via merlin ( mer ) and expanded ( ex ) , two ferm ( four point one , ezrin , moesin , radixin ) domain proteins ( hamaratoglu et  al . , 2006 ) .\nrecently , ex was shown to bind yki , and new experiments hint at the existence of an ex / hpo / wts - containing apical complex anchoring yki at the cortex ( badouel et  al . , 2009 ; oh et  al . , 2009 ) .\nhowever , though some upstream members are known , how the swh network is activated remains unclear .\nhere , we identify the ww - domain - containing protein kibra as a regulator of the swh network . human kibra ( kremerskothen et  al . , 2003 ) is known to be phosphorylated by protein kinase c  ( pkc ) ( buther et  al . , 2004 ) and has recently been reported to have a role in cell migration ( duning et  al . , 2008 ; rosse et  al . , 2009 ) .\nin drosophila , kibra had previously been recovered as  a minor hit in several screens for growth regulators ( boutros et  al .\n, 2004 ; muller et  al . , 2005 ; ringrose et  al . , 2003 ; tseng and hariharan , 2002 ) but has not been further studied .\nour experiments show that kibra associates with mer , ex , and wts and stabilizes the mer / ex interaction .\nthis suggests that kibra is a component of an apical scaffold that controls swh pathway activation .\nwe performed an in  vivo screen in the fly wing in order to identify genes implicated in growth control .\ntransgenic flies bearing rna  interference ( rnai ) constructs generated by the vienna drosophila rnai centre ( vdrc ) ( dietzl et  al . , 2007 ) were crossed to the hedgehog - gal4 ( hh - gal4 ) driver , leading to target gene silencing in the posterior compartment of the wing .\nthe results of this screen will be described elsewhere . in this context , expressing an rnai line directed against kibra induced overgrowth of the posterior wing compartment ( figure  1b ) compared to control flies ( figure  1a ) .\nthis phenotype was also observed upon wts depletion ( figure  1c ) . driving the same kibra rnai line in the eye also led to increased organ size ( figures 1d and 1e ) , similarly to a wts rnai line ( figure  1f ) . to exclude off - target effects\n, we generated a transgenic line expressing a nonoverlapping rnai construct and observed identical overgrowth phenotypes ( data not shown ) .\nfurthermore , adult eye sections revealed that kibra knockdown retinas present an excess of interommatidial cells ( iocs ) ( figures 1 g and 1h ) .\nthe iocs , the last population of cells to differentiate in the eye primordium , give rise to the secondary and tertiary pigment cells that optically isolate the ommatidia in the compound eye from each other .\nextra iocs are produced during normal development but are then eliminated by apoptosis at the pupal stage to give rise to the adult lattice ( wolff and ready , 1993 ) .\nthe presence of extra iocs is a hallmark of swh network loss of function ( kango - singh et  al . , 2002 ;\n2002 ) , which reduces retinal apoptosis , as seen in wts rnai adult eye sections ( figure  1i ) .\nthus , depletion of kibra elicits a similar phenotype to swh network mutants , suggesting a potential role for kibra in hpo signaling . to study kibra loss of function\n, we generated the kibra allele by imprecise excision of the ep747 transposon ( see figure  1j and experimental procedures ) .\nthis deletion allele , which removes the translation initiation site , is homozygous lethal and may be a null allele for kibra .\nkibra flp / frt mutant clones in 40 hr after - puparium - formation ( apf ) retinas present extra iocs ( figure  1k1 m ) , similarly to what was observed in adult eyes with kibra knockdown ( figures 1g1i ) .\nwe determined apoptotic indexes ( colombani et  al . , 2006 ) during the retinal apoptosis wave ( 28 hr apf ) in pupal retinas containing kibra mutant clones stained with an anti - active caspase-3 antibody .\nkibra mutant tissue presents a reduced apoptotic index compared with wild - type ( wt ) areas in the same retinas ( figures 1n1p ; see figures s1a \nwe assessed the proliferation rate of kibra mutant cells in imaginal discs , the larval precursors to the adult appendages . by using the flp / frt system under the control of the heat - shock promoter , kibra mutant cells and their wt sister clones\nwere generated through single recombination events from heterozygous mother cells ( brumby and richardson , 2005 ) .\nafter several rounds of divisions , the sizes of mutant clones ( no gfp ) and wt twin spots ( two copies of gfp ) were compared , allowing us to estimate the relative proliferation rates of mutant versus wt cells .\nthe total kibra clone area is 1.57 ( 0.12)-fold larger than the control twin spot area , compared to a ratio of 0.98 ( 0.09 ) when both clones and twin spots are wt ( figures 1q1s ) , indicating that kibra mutant cells grow 1.6 times faster than wt cells .\nin addition to cell cycle rates , the timing of cell cycle exit can readily be measured in the eye disc , where cell divisions follow a spatially determined pattern ( wolff and ready , 1993 ) . during the third larval instar , the morphogenetic furrow\nanterior to the furrow cells still proliferate asynchronously , while in the furrow cells synchronize in g1 .\nimmediately posterior to the furrow , cells enter a final round of synchronous s phases , the second mitotic wave ( smw ) .\nthus , in wt discs , no s phases ( marked by edu incorporation ) can be observed posterior to the smw ( figure  1 t ) . as expected , hpo mutant cells fail to exit from the cell cycle in a timely manner and present ectopic edu - positive staining posterior to the swm ( figures s1b and s1b ) .\nkibra mutant cells exhibit a less pronounced but similar phenotype ( figures 1u and 1v ) .\nthus , kibra mutant tissues have a proliferative advantage and an apoptosis defect , consistent with an involvement in the swh network\n. the overgrowth defect appears more subtle than that of core pathway members such as wts and is more akin to upstream regulators ( e.g. , ex and mer ) .\nseveral transcriptional targets of the swh network have been identified , such as the drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis 1 ( diap1 ) gene , the cell cycle regulator cyce , the mirna bantam , as well as ex ( harvey and tapon , 2007 ; saucedo and edgar , 2007 ) . in kibra mutant wing or eye discs\n, we could not detect a strong change in diap1 , cyce , or ex - lacz reporter levels ( data not shown ) . since overgrowth of kibra mutant cells in the wing is subtle compared to wts mutants ,\nit is possible that kibra  plays a relatively minor role in swh signaling in the wing .\naccordingly , using an anti - kibra antibody we generated ( figures s2a  s2c ) , we noted that kibra staining in the wing disc is weak and consists of a punctate apical staining which can clearly be observed when kibra is overexpressed in a stripe of cells .\nwe and others have previously reported that ovarian posterior follicle cells ( pfcs ) are particularly sensitive to swh loss of function ( meignin et  al .\n, 2007 ; polesello and tapon , 2007 ; yu et  al . , 2008 ) , leading us to study the kibra phenotype in the ovary .\nfirst , we noted that kibra protein levels are higher in follicle cells than in the wing discs ( figure  s2d \nkibra staining is mainly apical and is severely reduced in kibra clones . similarly to hpo or wts loss of function , kibra loss of function in the pfcs induces an upregulation of the ex - lacz reporter ( figures 2a2b , compare with figures 2c2c ) .\nhpo or wts mutant pfcs also show a misregulation of the notch ( n ) pathway and ectopic cell divisions ( meignin et  al .\nthe n target hindsight ( hnt ) is normally repressed in all follicle cells up to stage 6 and switched on from stage 7 to stage 10b ( figures 2d2e ) ( poulton and deng , 2007 ) .\ncut , which is repressed by hnt , presents an opposite pattern of expression ( figures 2h2i ) . in kibra\nmutant pfcs from stage 710b egg chambers , hnt expression is lost ( figures 2d2d and 2f2g ) , while cut is ectopically expressed ( figures 2j2k ) .\nloss of kibra also leads to perturbation of epithelial integrity , as mutant pfcs show an accumulation of the apical polarity protein apkc and the n receptor ( figures s2f  s2g ) as well as multilayering of the follicular epithelium ( figures 2i2i and 2k2k ) .\nectopic mitotic divisions are also observed in pfcs clones after stage 6 , as detected by phospho - histone h3 ( ph3 ) staining ( figures s2h  s2h ) .\ntogether , these phenotypes are identical to those observed in hpo or wts loss of function , suggesting that kibra is indeed a member of the swh network . to further explore the role of kibra in the swh network , genetic interaction and epistasis experiments were performed .\noverexpressing kibra in the eye under the gmr ( glass multimer reporter ) promoter elicits the formation of a small rough eye with frequent ommatidial fusions ( figures s3a  s3b ) .\nthis phenotype can be partially rescued by removing one copy of the hpo gene ( figures s3c and s3c ) .\nin contrast , overexpressing kibra could not rescue the hpo - like overgrowth phenotype induced by yki overexpression ( figures s3d and s3e ) , suggesting that kibra may be an upstream regulator of the pathway .\nto conduct epistasis experiments between kibra and yki , we used the marcm system to generate clones of mutant cells while simultaneously overexpressing or depleting other pathway components ( lee and luo , 1999 ) .\nmarcm clones expressing yki rnai generated with eyflp lead to the formation of a normal eye , because yki - depleted cells are eliminated by apoptosis ( data not shown ) and replaced by wt cells ( figure  s3f ) .\nas expected , eyflp kibra marcm clones cause eye overgrowth ( figure  s3 g ) .\n, overexpressing kibra in the eye under the gmr promoter induces apoptosis in third instar eye discs , which is suppressed by loss of hpo ( figures 3a3a ) .\ntogether , these epistasis experiments are consistent with kibra being a member of the swh network acting upstream of yki and hpo .\ngenetic interactions between kibra , mer , and ex , upstream members of the swh network , were then investigated .\nexpressing a kibra , an ex , or a mer rnai line in the eye under the gmr promoter induces eye overgrowth ( figures s3i  s3l ) .\ncombined depletion of either ex / kibra or mer / kibra shows stronger phenotypes than individual depletion of these proteins ( figures s3 m and s3n ) .\nhsflp marcm clones of various genotypes were generated and scored according to the severity of the wing overgrowth phenotypes , with type 0 representing normal wings and type 4 the strongest overgrowth ( figures 3b and 3c ) .\noverexpressing ex or mer in kibra mutant clones significantly rescues the overgrowth of kibra mutant clones ( p < 0.0001 for both genotypes ) .\nreciprocally , kibra overexpression was also able to suppress the ex overgrowth phenotype ( p < 0.0001 ) .\nthus , we could not determine a strict epistatic relationship between kibra , ex , and mer , consistent with a model whereby kibra , ex , and mer cooperate to control swh pathway activity .\nas well as being an upstream regulator of the swh network , ex is  also one of its transcriptional targets ( hamaratoglu et  al . , 2006 ) , as are other upstream regulators ( e.g. , mer , four - jointed , dachsous ) .\nsince epistasis experiments place kibra at the level of mer and ex , we wished to test whether this is also the case for kibra .\nkibra levels were highly upregulated in mer;ex or hpo clones ( figures 3d3e ) , showing an apical localization ( figures 3f3g ) .\nsimilarly , hpo - depleted cultured drosophila s2r+ cells have increased kibra levels ( figure  3j ) . to determine whether kibra is a transcriptional swh network target ,\nquantitative rt - pcr experiments were performed on yki - overexpressing and control wing imaginal discs ( figure  3k ) . as expected ,\nex mrna levels were increased ( 2.97  0.25-fold ) in yki - expressing discs compared to control discs . interestingly , kibra mrna levels were also upregulated in yki - expressing discs ( 6.24  2.12-fold ) , confirming that kibra is a yki transcriptional target and suggesting the existence of a possible negative feedback loop regulating kibra expression . because hpo clones present increased levels of kibra as well as mer and ex , these constitute a good system to evaluate the colocalization of those proteins .\nthus , kibra , mer , and ex colocalize apically in imaginal disc cells , but are dispensable for each other 's apical sorting , because kibra is still apical in mer;ex clones and mer / ex are normally localized in kibra clones ( figures 3d , 3d , 3f , and 3f and data not shown ) . because kibra colocalizes with mer / ex , a possible association between those proteins was examined by conducting coimmunoprecipitation ( co - ip ) assays in s2r+ cells .\nkibra was found to co - ip with ex and mer , but not with hpo or with the negative regulator of hpo , drassf ( polesello et  al . , 2006 )\ninterestingly , kibra was reported to interact with mer in a large - scale yeast two - hybrid screening study ( formstecher et  al . , 2005 ) .\nkibra possesses two ww domains , which are predicted to mediate protein - protein interactions by binding to ppxy motifs .\nfurthermore , the first ww domain of human kibra was shown to recognize the consensus motif rxppxy in  vitro ( kremerskothen et  al . , 2003 ) .\nin flies , mer does not contain any ppxy sites , while ex has two ppxy sites ( pppy and pppy ) and an rxppxy site ( rdpppy ) .\nwe therefore further investigated the association between kibra and ex by mutating amino acids that are known to be required for ww domains and ppxy sites to interact ( kremerskothen et  al .\na kibra protein mutant for its first ww domain ( p85a ) could no longer co - ip wt ex .\nreciprocally , wt kibra could not co - ip an ex protein deficient for its rxppxy site ( p845a ) ( figure  4b ) .\nthus , kibra associates with ex through its first ww domain and the ex rxppxy motif .\nin contrast , mutating either one or both kibra ww domains does not affect kibra / mer association ( figure  s4a ) .\nfurther assays reveal that both kibra n- and c - terminal fragments are sufficient for the association with mer , but a central stretch ( aa 484857 ) is not ( figure  s4a ) . because the ww motifs , which are required for the ex / kibra association , are located in the n - terminal fragment , this suggests that mer can complex with kibra both through ex and independently of ex .\nto further test this possibility , coimmunoprecipitation assays between mer and kibra were performed in ex - depleted cells ( figure  s4b ) .\nthe kibra / mer immunoprecipitation is not affected by ex depletion , suggesting that ex is not required for the kibra / mer association . because the hpo pathway is highly conserved from drosophila to humans , we tested for potential interactions between human kibra and the human orthologs of ex ( frmd6 ) , mer ( nf2/mer ) , hpo ( mst2 ) , and drassf ( rassf6 ) .\nwe used split - tev as readout , which is based on tev protease complementation and represents a sensitive method for detecting interactions between membrane - associated proteins ( wehr et  al .\nwe found that kibra associates with nf2/mer but did not interact with frmd6 , mst2 , or rassf6 ( figure  s4c ) .\ninterestingly , frmd6 contains only an n - terminally conserved sequence of ex but lacks the entire c - terminal part , which in ex harbors the ppxy motifs .\nthus , the missing ppxy motifs and the generally limited level of sequence conservation in frmd6 likely explain the absence of interaction between kibra and frmd6 .\nthese results imply that the ability to associate with kibra evolved in an ancestral ex / mer - like ferm domain protein and was later lost in frmd6 but retained in nf2/mer . alternatively ,\nas kibra complexes with both ex and mer and ex / mer have been reported to directly interact ( mccartney et  al . , 2000 ) , we tested the possibility that kibra could affect the mer / ex interaction .\nwe performed co - ip assays between mer and ex in cells expressing different levels of kibra protein ( figure  4c ) .\nthe mer / ex interaction is reduced in kibra - depleted cells compared to wt cells , whereas the interaction is strengthened in cells that express a myc - kibra construct .\nthus , the presence of kibra is required to fine - tune the stability of the mer / ex interaction . because kibra complexes with ex and a yki / ex interaction has recently been described ( badouel et  al . , 2009 ) , we sought to determine whether kibra can affect yki activity .\ns2r+ cells were treated with rnai against several swh pathway components , and yki phophorylation on ser168 was monitored by western blotting ( figure  4d ) .\nthe phosphorylation of yki by wts at ser168 leads to yki inactivation and sequestration in the cytoplasm , where it has been reported to bind ex , wts , hpo , and 14.3.3 ( badouel et  al . , 2009 ;\nhuang et  al . , 2005 ; oh and irvine , 2008 ; oh et  al . , 2009 ) .\nlacz rnai - treated cells show a high basal level of phospho - yki ( p - yki ) .\nas expected , yki phosphorylation is abolished when wts is depleted , and mildly reduced when the wts cofactor mats ( lai et  al . , 2005 )\ntreated rnai cells , a yki downward shift can also be observed using  a pan - yki antibody ( figure  4d , second row ) .\nwhen depleted in conjunction with ex , the p - yki signal becomes even further reduced .\nthis suggests that kibra and ex are required for wts activity on  yki , which prompted us to investigate whether kibra could associate with wts .\nco - ip assays reveal that kibra interacts with wts ( figure  4e ) .\nwts does not seem to compete with ex for kibra association , because it could still complex with  a form of kibra mutant for its first ww domain . because kibra associates with wts and ex interacts with yki , we investigated whether wts requires kibra / ex to bind yki .\nendogenous ips between yki and wts were performed in s2 cells treated with various dsrnas ( figure  4f ) . in these conditions ,\nthe effect of kibra and ex depletion on yki phosphorylation can also be observed ( see input ) . in control cells ,\nthis endogenous interaction is unaffected by the individual or combined depletion of ex  and kibra .\nthese results suggest that ex and kibra are required to activate the swh pathway by nucleating an active hpo / wts kinase cassette , rather than promoting the wts / yki interaction .\nour data identify kibra as a regulator of the swh network that associates with ex and mer , with which it is colocalized apically and transcriptionally coregulated .\ngiven that the apical surface of epithelial cells is instrumental in both cell - cell signaling and tissue morphogenesis , we speculate that kibra may cooperate with ex and mer to transduce an extracellular signal , or relay information about epithelial architecture , via the swh network , to control tissue growth and morphogenesis .\nrecent data have suggested that an apical scaffold machinery containing hpo , wts , and ex recruits yki to the apical membrane , facilitating its inhibitory phosphorylation by wts ( badouel et  al . , 2009 ; oh et  al . , 2009\nsince kibra associates with ex and is also apically localized , we can hypothesize that kibra is also part of this scaffold and participates in nucleating an active hpo / wts complex and recruiting yki for inactivation .\nthis view is supported by our finding that kibra complexes with wts and that combined depletion of kibra and ex leads to a strong decrease in yki phosphorylation , but does not disrupt the wts / yki interaction .\nour data also suggest that the importance of kibra may be tissue - specific since we observe robust phenotypes in ovaries and hemocyte - derived s2r+ cells , but weaker effects in imaginal discs .\nthus , considering the relative levels of expression of ex , mer , and kibra may be important in determining pathway activation .\nfinally , since mammalian kibra complexes with the nf2/mer tumor suppressor , our findings raise the possibility that human kibra may contribute to tumor suppression in human neurofibromas and potentially other tumors .\nfor drosophila genotypes , primer sequences , and further experimental details , see supplemental experimental procedures .\nthe p element of ep747 ( bloomington stock center ) was mobilized using standard genetic techniques , and excisions were screened by pcr ( see supplemental experimental procedures for details ) .\nmouse -galactosidase ( promega ) , rabbit anti - cleaved caspase-3 ( asp175 ) ( cell signaling technology ) , rabbit anti - apkc ( santa cruz ) , and mouse nicd ( c17.9c6 , development studies hybridoma bank ) antibodies were used at 1/500 .\nmouse anti -

frozen in liquid nitrogen .\nrna isolation and subsequent qrt - pcr reactions were performed as described in genevet et  al .\nall statistical analyses performed ( except epistasis analysis ) were assessed by mann - whitney nonparametric tests using the website http://elegans.swmed.edu/leon/stats/utest.html .\nthe epistasis analysis was made by pairwise comparison after correction for  the batch effect on 42 to 310 flies of each genotype , divided in 4 to 6 cohorts .\nthe approach used was a three - way log - linear model , against  a null - hypothesis of no interaction between phenotype and population .\nthe p value indicates whether the pair of populations differ in their phenotype profiles : p  value(kibra ; kibra + uas ex ) = 2.69  10 , p value(kibra ; kibra + uas mer ) = 6.07  10 , p value(ex ; ex + uas kibra ) = 1.76  10 ."}

making versus the conceptualization of genetics and genetic conditions . in our study , fps actually expressed their clear role in genetics , especially in terms of a comprehensive approach .\nspecifically , our study showed that fps perceived importance of providing genetic test information was the highest for the items associated with practical management of their patients , such as providing information about clinical implications of positive and negative genetic test results to patients and giving information on the risk of passing a mutation onto children .\nanother study showed that fps had a high level of uncertainty about genetic test results .\nthis confirms the findings of our study that fps seemed to think a lot about the practical management of patients .\nfps are known to be practically oriented and recognize the implications and the benefits of using some knowledge and tests in their everyday management of patients .\nthe high perceived importance of giving information about the risk of passing a mutation onto children points to the basic feature of family medicine \nlower interest was found in items concerning ethical issues ( confidentiality and patient right to remain in ignorance ) .\nas ethical issues are an inevitable part of genetic testing , it seems clear that fps need additional education on this theme .\nthe majority of fps in our study received education on genetics at the undergraduate level . on the other hand\n, more than 74% reported having contacts with patients with genetic diseases at least weekly . since the mean age of fps was almost 50 years\nthis study was performed in a representative sample of slovenian fps and its findings can therefore be generalized to the whole population of fps in slovenia .\nanother strength of this study is the use of a previously validated questionnaire , which gives us confidence in the reliability of data .\nthis was a cross - sectional study , thus it is impossible to detect any causal relationship between variables .\nthe response rate in this study was as expected because a 20% response rate is usual for postal surveys .\nmost slovene family physicians feel responsible for and willing to offer and discuss genetic testing and its implications with their patients ."}
{"id": 108, "text": "we present a case in which laparoscopy was both diagnostic and therapeutic in a patient with a spigelian hernia .\na 35-year - old man was referred to the general surgery service for evaluation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain of approximately 6 months .\nthe patient did not have any significant past medical or surgical history , and the physical examination was significant only for an area of focal tenderness in the right lower quadrant .\nultrasound and ct scans of the patient 's abdomen were unremarkable . a laparoscopic exploration of the area revealed a defect in the area of semilunar and semicircular lines consistent with a spigelian hernia .\nthis case illustrates the role of laparoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of spigelian hernias .\nrecently , imaging modalities , such as ultrasound and computed tomography , have increased preoperative diagnostic yield . however , in some , the spigelian hernia eludes diagnosis .\nwe present a case where laparoscopic surgery was both diagnostic and therapeutic in an individual with a spigelian hernia .\nthe purpose of this case report and literature review is to describe and review the use of minimally invasive surgery in the diagnosis and repair of abdominal wall defects such as spigelian hernias .\nwe conducted a medline search of all reported cases of laparoscopic spigelian hernia repairs that were published in english to date .\njust prior to the induction of anesthesia , the patient 's abdomen was palpated until his typical abdominal pain and discomfort were reproduced .\nthis area corresponding to his symptoms was outlined around the examining finger with a marking pen .\na vertical supraumbilical incision was made approximately 5 cm superior to the umbilicus , and intraperitoneal access was gained with a veress needle .\na 10-mm , 30-degree laparoscope was inserted into the abdomen , and immediately upon entry a small cleft - like defect was seen in the area corresponding to that marked on the skin .\nthis site was in the proximity of the topographical representation of the junction of the semilunar and semicircular lines , making it consistent with a spigelian hernia .\nthis was lying close to the hernial defect and may have represented formerly incarcerated contents of the hernia .\nwe suspect that the intraperitoneal insufflation to 15 mm hg , with separation of the anterior abdominal wall from the abdominal contents , may have affected reduction of the hernia . a full laparoscopic exploration of the abdomen with attention focused on both inguinal regions and\ntwo 5-mm trocars through which dissecting instruments were passed were placed in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen .\nthe peritoneum surrounding the defect was dissected circumferentially with a combination of sharp and blunt instrumentation ( figure 1 ) .\na 4 x 6-cm piece of polypropylene mesh was delivered into the abdominal cavity though the 10-mm camera port .\nthe intraabdominal insufflation pressure was decreased to 8 mm hg , and the peritoneum was tacked over the mesh ( figure 3 ) .\nthe fascia around the 10-mm trocar site incision and the skin at all trocar sites were closed with absorbable suture . cleft defect seen corresponding to the exact location of the patient 's pain .\nadrian van der spieghel , born in padau in 1578 , is credited with the initial description of the semilunar line .\nthis line demarcates where the transverses abdominis muscle becomes aponeurotic as it travels medially toward the rectus sheath .\nthat portion of the transverses abdominis muscle bordered by the semilunar line laterally , and the lateral border of the rectus sheath medially , is termed the spigelian aponeurosis .\nthe first report of a spigelian hernia appeared in 1764 , and it is attributed to klinkosch .\nthe majority of spigelian hernias are located in proximity to the point where the semilunar line crosses the semi - circular line of douglas . the proclivity for this area\nis thought to be due to the division of the spigelian aponeurosis into 2 layers in this region . here ,\nthe fibers of the spigelian aponeurosis interdigitate with the fibers of the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths . the dorsal layer of the spigelian aponeurosis is particularly weakened by this loss of uniformity .\ninferior to this area , the spigelian aponeurosis is reconstituted into a single , stronger layer .\nnonetheless , a number of hernias have been reported protruding through the spigelian aponeurosis in the region of hesselbach 's triangle .\nmost spigelian hernias are intercalated between layers of the abdominal wall and are thus termed interparietal or interstitial .\nthe diagnosis of a spigelian hernia by history and physical examination is notoriously difficult because its clinical manifestations are protean .\nusually little can be uncovered from the patient 's history that is specific for the diagnosis .\noccasionally , symptoms may be referable to an intraabdominal organ , or to tissue that is contained within the hernia sac .\nstomach , meckel 's diverticulum , colon , appendix , ovary , testicle , and endometrial tissue have all been found in a spigelian hernia sac .\nmuch of the difficulty with the physical diagnosis of a spigelian hernia is due to the interparietal location of the defect .\nthe hernia protrudes through the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis , but is usually covered superficially by the external oblique muscle . because the internal oblique offers little resistance , the hernia may spread between the oblique muscles\n. this can confound surgeons who center an incision over a palpable mass , only to find the actual hernia defect in a remote location .\nthese pitfalls in the history and physical examination of spigelian hernias have resulted in patients being followed for years before the diagnosis is made .\nconventional and contrast - enhanced studies like plain abdominal roentgenograms , upper gastrointestinal studies , small bowel follow - through , and barium enemas are of little use , particularly in the absence of signs of intestinal obstruction .\nmore success has been achieved with imaging modalities capable of accurately characterizing the abdominal wall . abdominal ultrasonography with a 3.5- to 5.0-mhz transducer\nfindings on an ultrasound examination that suggest the presence of a spigelian hernia include visualization of a complex mass within the layers of the anterior abdominal wall .\nin particular , mesentery and omentum will appear echogenic , and air - filled bowel will result in shadowing .\nthe presence of one or more of these elements in the anterior abdominal wall , within the spigelian aponeurosis , supports the diagnosis .\nadditionally , the hernia defect itself can be seen as an interruption in the echo line of the aponeurosis .\nabdominal computed tomography is also an excellent study for the diagnosis of a spigelian hernia .\nsimilar to ultrasound , it can delineate the contents of the hernia sac and can demonstrate the defect in the spigelian aponeurosis .\nsuccessful diagnosis by computed tomography after a nondiagnostic or equivocal ultrasound have been reported . because it is more easily performed and less costly , some authors have advocated initial examination by ultrasound followed by computed tomography if a diagnosis is still in doubt .\nalthough sophisticated radiological techniques may be helpful , in some cases the hernia still eludes diagnosis .\nthey are associated with a relatively high complication rate , mainly associated with diagnostic delays .\nthe most common operative approach remains a gridiron skin incision when the hernia is palpable .\nfor nonpalpable defects , a paramedian incision is made in which the ventral lamella of the rectus sheath is opened .\noften the patient 's incision is disproportionately large for the size of the hernia defect .\na newer , open surgical technique has been described that involves an alternative method of localizing the hernia defect . using an infraumbilical or lower midline vertical incision\na direct cutdown is then performed over the examiner 's finger , exposing the hernia defect .\nproponents of this technique contend that this can be accomplished through 2 small incisions and obviates the need for both expensive laparoscopic equipment and the use of polypropylene mesh in the abdomen .\nrecently , minimally invasive surgical techniques have been applied to the diagnosis , localization , and repair of spigelian hernias .\nour review of the literature yielded 16 reports , which describe a total of 30 cases .\nthe remainder are case reports . in the only prospective trial to date by moreno - egea et al , open versus\npostoperative morbidity , length of in - hospital stay , number of patients requiring admission , and hernia recurrence were evaluated .\nthey showed the superiority of the laparoscopic technique by demonstrating a significant difference in morbidity between the groups : 4 hematomas in the open group versus none in the laparoscopic group ( p<0.05 ) .\nin addition , the length of hospital stay in the laparoscopic group was significantly shorter : 5 days for the open group versus 1 day for the laparoscopic group ( p<0.001 ) .\nninety - one percent of the laparoscopic group were treated on an outpatient basis versus 9% in the open group .\nthey concluded that laparoscopic repair of spigelian hernias significantly reduces patient morbidity and hospital stay and can be safely performed on an outpatient basis . in the series of felix and michas ,\npreviously unsuspected bilateral inguinal hernias were diagnosed by laparoscopy in 1 case in which a right - sided inguinal hernia was also repaired .\nsuccessful concomitant laparoscopic repairs of umbilical , inguinal , femoral hernias and cholecystectomy have been described .\na case series by amendolara showed successful simultaneous cholecystectomy and umbilical herniorrhaphy performed in 2 of their patients .\nno complications were reported in that series , and at 3-month follow - up , there had been no recurrences .\nfisher and teleky et al also reported simultaneous cholecystectomy and spigelian hernia repair with success . the patient reported by fisher\nsubsequently had a left inguinal hernia repaired laparoscopically , at which time the spigelian herniorrhaphy was found intact .\nstrand and larsen described a repair of a spigelian hernia and bilateral femoral hernias in the same patient without complications .\nsimilarly , gedebou and neubauer repaired bilateral spigelian and inguinal hernias in 1 patient . again , this was done without complications , and at 1-year follow - up , there were no reported recurrences .\nde matteo , morris , and broderick described the incidental finding and repair of a left spigelian hernia found during a laparoscopic bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer staging in a 64-year - old man .\nbarie , thompson , and mack described a planned laparoscopic repair of a spigelian hernia using a composite prosthesis .\nthe patient had a history of a right ovarian chocolate cyst , and on physical examination was found to have a left - sided spigelian hernia . because the patient was to have a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy , a laparoscopic mesh repair of the hernia was planned .\nthe procedure was completed without complications , and the patient was symptom - free and without recurrence at 12-month follow - up .\nseveral case reports ( table 1 ) by appeltans , carter and michas , habib , iswariah , kasirajan , tarnoff , and welter demonstrate successful repair of spigelian hernias without significant complications .\nsuccessful treatment of a spigelian hernia with incarcerated jejunum in an 80-year - old woman was reported by novell et al .\nlarson and farley at the mayo clinic published a retrospective review of 81 patients who underwent spigelian hernia repair .\nthere were no complications with this patient , and after a 7-year follow - up , no recurrence was reported .\nwe conclude that the laparoscopic approach to spigelian hernias offers several advantages to any open operative technique currently described .\nlaparoscopy affords full abdominal exploration and the opportunity for diagnosis of synchronous abdominal conditions , which if present , can be addressed at the same operation .\nthese benefits combined with the low morbidity , low rates of recurrence , and the ability to be safely performed on an outpatient basis , makes laparoscopic repair of spigelian hernias the treatment of choice ."}
{"id": 109, "text": "a number of bacteria resist axenic ( i.e.  cell - free ) culture in the laboratory . those include obligate parasites causing serious human diseases , such as rickettsia ( 1,2 ) and mycobacterium leprae ( 3 ) .\nthey adapt to a limited environment that provides appropriate physical conditions , nutriments and other factors required for their replication and growth .\ncurrent culture systems of obligate parasitic bacteria depend on eukaryotic cells ( e.g. for rickettsia ) or even entire living animals ( e.g. for m.leprae ) .\nthe lack of cell - free culture media poses a critical problem in studying these bacteria . without cell - free culture , it is impossible to use modern experimental approaches ( e.g. transcriptomics , proteomics ) that depend on non - contaminated rna or protein extractions . thus , the establishments of axenic culture media for those pathogens would have a significant impact on the medical and biological research communities working on these diseases . in a more fundamental way , this type of study might help to unraveling various type of signals involved in their host  parasite relationships . with the recent development of metabolic databases ( 4,5 ) , genome - based metabolic reconstruction has become an efficient approach to tackle this problem ( 6,7 ) . by examining the metabolic pathways predicted from genomic sequence analyses\nwe recently analyzed the complete genome sequence of a human pathogen , tropheryma whipplei strain twist , and identified significant deficiencies in the biosynthesis of nine amino acids ( 8) . remarkably , this knowledge effectively guided the development of the first axenic culture medium to grow this fastidious microorganism ( 7 ) that had been previously cultured only in association with a fibroblast cell line ( hel ) ( 9 ) .\nwe believe that this type of approach should be generalized and could allow more obligate parasitic bacteria to be grown in a cell - free culture medium .\nit is clear that explicit hypotheses ( e.g.  required nutriments ) and supporting evidences ( e.g.  deficiencies of the de novo synthesis ) are determinants for this type of study .\nhowever , such a biological knowledge is usually dispersed in literature and various biological databases . till date\n, no existing database exhaustively collects and systematically provides biological knowledge about the cultivation of obligate parasites .\nthis prompted us to gather evidences and hypotheses that are relevant to the improvement of the culture conditions of obligate parasites and make them available in a knowledgebase named metagrowth ( http://igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/axenic/ ) . in this paper , we describe the source of the data accessible in metagrowth as well as its web interface guiding the user to design new cell - free culture media of obligate parasites .\nhypotheses relevant to the improvement of the culture conditions of parasitic bacteria as follows : \n example 1 .\nevidence :  the genome does not encode enzymes for the biosynthesis of compound x , but encodes a transporter for x.  hypothesis :  adding x may improve the growth.example 2 . evidence :  the genome encodes enzymes requiring cofactor y , but does not encode genes for the biosynthesis of cofactor y.  hypothesis :  adding y may improve the growth. \n these kinds of information are collected from the published literature , genomic sequence databases ( 4 ) , metabolic databases ( 4,5,10,11 ) and transporter databases ( 12 ) .\ntable 1 shows a tentative metagrowth entry describing the supplementation of s - adenosyl - l - methionine for the improvement of rickettsia culture conditions .\nevidence and  hypothesis records are the two main components of the database entry . the evidence record is a free text describing experimentally validated facts or predicted metabolic features .\nassociated hypotheses for the improvement of the culture condition are stored in the hypothesis record . in the hypothesis record\n, we currently describe the supplementation of organic or inorganic compounds in the medium , or appropriate physical conditions such as oxygen concentration . a prefix  in= in the hypothesis record designates a preferential input ( a compound or a physical condition ) to the culture medium that could be experimentally tested .\nhyperlinks to relevant genes , pathways and literature in the source databases are provided to direct the users to the original data .\ncurrently , we have accumulated 220 metagrowth entries for 6 species of bacteria ( 5 genera ) : rickettsia prowazekii and rickettsia conorii ( agents of typhus and spotted fever , respectively ; 40 entries ) , t.whipplei ( whipple 's disease ; 38 entries ) , treponema pallidum ( 13 ) ( syphilis ; 42 entries ) , m.leprae ( leprosy ; 63 entries ) and coxiella burnetii ( 14 ) ( q - fever ; 37 entries ) .\nevidence :  the genome does not encode enzymes for the biosynthesis of compound x , but encodes a transporter for x.  hypothesis :  adding x may improve the growth. example 2 . evidence :  the genome encodes enzymes requiring cofactor y , but does not encode genes for the biosynthesis of cofactor y.  hypothesis :  adding y may improve the growth. rating of the reliability of collected scientific evidences is an important issue in constructing a database of biological hypotheses ( 15 ) . in metagrowth , the relationships between evidences and hypotheses were classified into several categories .\nthe evidence types could be used for the prioritization of different hypotheses supported by different kinds of evidences .\nclass i evidences describe the inability to synthesize a compound , either by metabolic deficiencies or by general incapability of biosynthesis ( e.g. inorganic molecules such as metal ions ) .\nclass ii evidences refer to the importing capability of a compound , either by active transporters or by passive membrane permeability .\nclass iii evidences refer to the requirement or utilization of a compound by the bacteria .\nthose include cofactors required for known or predicted enzymatic reactions in the cell , and basic building blocks of macromolecules such as the 20 amino acids .\nclass iv evidences refer to the other type of evidences , mostly experimentally validated facts .\nthe precise definitions of these evidence classes and subclasses are provided in the supplementary material ( table s1 ) .\nfigure 1 shows the current status of the number of hypotheses supported by different types of evidences .\nbrowsing metagrowth entries , users can easily obtain a list of nutriment compounds and the corresponding list of evidences suggesting the supplementation of the medium by these compounds .\nan important practical issue is the determination of the concentrations of those supplemented molecules . to help the users with this respect\nthe ranges were determined according to the roles of molecules in bacterial cells and the concentrations of the molecules of the same role in several reference culture media . as reference culture media , we selected two complex culture media for fastidious ( i.e.  difficult to grow ) bacteria : bsk - h medium designed to support the growth of the lyme disease spirochete borrelia burgdorferi ( 16 ) , and twh medium supporting the growth of t.whipplei ( 7 ) .\nthe concentrations of the components in the two media and the upper and lower limits of the concentrations within each compound category are provided in the supplementary material ( figure s1 ) .\nthe users may specify one or more values within the suggested range of concentration of each molecule .\nif the users specify more than one concentration in the range , the combination of different concentrations for different molecules could lead to a huge number of experiments even if the number of molecules remains relatively small .\nthe full combinatorial testing of 20 different nutriments , at two concentrations each , corresponds to 2  10 .\nsuch a large number of screening experiments can be avoided by the use of the incomplete factorial design approach .\nincomplete factorial design is a mathematical method to effectively reduce the number of experiments required by a full combinatorial - screening of parameters ( 17 ) .\nsamba is an implementation of the incomplete factorial design , which has been extensively used for the determination of protein crystallization conditions ( 18 ) , and more recently for optimizing recombinant protein experiments ( 19 ) .\nmetagrowth outputs the list of molecules and their concentrations in a format compatible with the samba program ( http://igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/samba/ ) . in the above example with 20 compounds ,\n, the incomplete factorial design provides a minimal set of experiments in which the influence of each parameter can be examined rationally by statistical methods such as a multiple linear regression analysis .\nmany evidences in metagrowth originate in metabolic analyses described in the literature such as whole genome sequencing papers .\nthe use of in silico simulation studies with more sophisticated mathematical metabolic models ( 2023 ) than those available in the current metabolic databases ( 4,5 ) is clearly the next improvement in the generation of metabolic hypotheses . with these approaches ,\none may , more precisely , examine metagrowth evidences and derived hypotheses such as  a metabolic pathway from x to y lacks an enzyme , thus the addition of y in the medium may improve the culture of bacteria. in silico simulation studies may reveal an alternative pathway to the metabolite y bypassing the missing reaction steps . in the current metagrowth , we only present predictions for preferential inputs to the culture conditions ( designated by the  in= prefix ) .\n. compound nomenclature in metagrowth is based on ligand ( 10 ) , in which hierarchical relationships between individual and generic compound names are not well treated .\nstandardization of the compound name in metagrowth will be required to facilitate data update and to automatically detect data redundancies .\ngenome sequence analysis and metabolic reconstruction of t.whipplei led to the establishment of the first cell - free culture medium allowing this fastidious bacteria to grow outside its cellular host .\nfurther improvement of the culture condition using metagrowth may lead to an even faster growth , which would further facilitate the manipulation and study of this microorganism .\nthe development of an axenic culture medium for other bacteria could be more challenging . for m.leprae and t.pallidum ,\na large body of research has been carried out to explore the possibility of axenic cultivation as can be seen in metagrowth .\nthe study of bacterial culture conditions offers new testable and valuable challenges for the whole cell metabolic modeling and simulation studies .\nit helps better characterization of host  parasite relationships , eventually giving us clues about new therapeutic targets .\nwe hope to help the scientific community working on those pathogens by providing comprehensive information about their culture conditions through metagrowth .\ntable s1 gives the definition of the classes and the subclasses of the relationships between evidences and hypotheses .\nwe thank dr didier raoult for helpful discussions and dr guillaume blanc for carefully reading the manuscript ."}
{"id": 110, "text": "a growing body of evidence shows that prediabetic condition is a risk factor for type-2-diabetes and cardiovascular complications.13 prediabetes is defined as impaired glucose tolerance ( igt ) and/or impaired fasting glucose.2 igt is associated with metabolic syndrome and is a strong predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , whereas impaired fasting glucose is a much weaker predictor.4 there are no less than 300 million people with prediabetic condition worldwide , and the number is predicted to rise up to 418 million by 2025 . every year\n, 2%11% of the prediabetic population are converting to type-2-diabetics.1,2,4,5 therefore , early intervention in the prediabetic stage is a valuable approach to reduce diabetes development and prevent related complications.3,6,7 insulin resistance , -cell dysfunction , and uncontrolled calorie consumption have been the crucial contributors to acute postprandial hyperglycemia and are the potential agents that convert prediabetes to diabetes.4,8,9 the acute postprandial hyperglycemia is responsible for glucotoxicity in the pathophysiology of type-2-diabetes even at the earlier stage ( ie , prediabetes).10 further in a vicious cycle , the impairment of -cell function and exacerbation of insulin resistance due to glucotoxicity play a crucial role in the progression of diabetes and development of its cardiovascular complications.4,10 interventions that preserve -cell function and ameliorate insulin resistance have been proven to be most effective in preventing progression to diabetes .\nmany studies on lifestyle modification , including diet control and regular physical exercise,1114 and pharmacological interventions using -glucosidase inhibitors,15,16 insulin sensitizers , such as metformin17 and thiazolidinediones,15,18 and incretin - mimetic agents,19 have been reported to have beneficial effects on inhibition of diabetes progression and complication .\nindeed , lifestyle approach is safe , and in the long run ( 24 years ) , effectively reduces type-2-diabetes incidence by 28%58%.1113 however , lifestyle interventions are notoriously difficult to maintain over a long period . among the antidiabetic agents , thiazolidinediones , particularly pioglitazone , showed the most remarkable risk reduction ( ie , up to 72% ) of igt conversion to type-2-diabetes.3,4,18 however , long - term use of pioglitazone ( > 2 years ) was associated with discernible weight gain and edema,18 both of which are not favorable with respect to reducing cardiovascular risks . because of these limitations of currently available interventions , there is a need to introduce a new substance for the treatment of prediabetes .\ndlbs3233 , a novel bioactive fraction derived from the plants cinnamomum burmanii and lagerstroemia speciosa , has previously been studied for its insulin -

pharmacological and pharmacological interventions in igt have been effective in preventing or delaying macrovascular complications and conversion to overt diabetes .\nour study preliminarily demonstrated the benefits of dlbs3233 in improving insulin resistance and preserving -cell performance in subjects with igt . in this study , subjects were diagnosed to have igt based on the ogtt .\n-cells respond to an increment in glucose ( glc ) with an increment in insulin ( ins ) , and this response is modulated by the severity of insulin resistance . therefore , -cell performance is more appropriately measured as a function of both insulin secretory response to glucose stimulus and insulin resistance .\nsimply measuring plasma insulin response to assess -cell function may be misleading.4 in our study , we included both the insulin level and insulin resistance to estimate -cell performance as reflected by the dio .\nafter 12 weeks of treatment , the insulin resistance was ameliorated in dlbs3233 group as demonstrated by a significant homa - ir reduction ( figure 1a ) .\nour study showed that augmentation of insulin sensitivity by dlbs3233 , through its insulin - sensitizing properties,20,21 was finally compensated by a significant reduction  which can also be translated as normalization  of the first- and second - phase insulin levels as shown in dlbs3233-treated group after 8 and 12 weeks .\na former study by kahn30 showed a similar finding that when insulin sensitivity was improved by exercise , a reduced insulin secretion was observed .\nanother study by ferrannini et al31 and gastaldelli et al32 demonstrated that improvement of insulin sensitivity by insulin sensitizers was associated with a decline in plasma insulin response .\nthe decline in the first- and second - phase insulin response has been generally interpreted to reflect the normal compensatory response of -cells to the improvement of insulin sensitivity and/or reduced plasma glucose level .\nguldstrand et al33 demonstrated that the reduction in insulin secretion was quantitatively not as prominent as the increase in insulin sensitivity , which increased the disposition index along with weight reduction . in our study , we also observed that the increased insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin demand by dlbs3233 treatment simultaneously led to the enhanced performance of -cells , as confirmed by a significant increase of the dio . increased\nhowever , whether dlbs3233 exerts a direct effect on the pancreatic -cells to enhance insulin secretion remains to be studied .\nin line with the augmentation of insulin sensitivity , the rate of clearance ( mcr ) of the glucose from circulation was promoted , at a significantly greater extent than placebo . nevertheless , the reduction of both 15-minute and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels by dlbs3233 was not significantly different than that of placebo . yet , as has been elaborately described earlier , the finding that the required 15-minute and 2-hour plasma insulin secretion to maintain the normal level of postprandial glucose was normalized ( lowered ) was of clinical importance ; it consistently indicated an improvement of insulin sensitivity .\nbergman et al34 and kahn et al35 identified the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and secretion .\nthe clinical consequence of the hyperbolic relationship is that increased insulin sensitivity will be compensated by reduction , or downregulation , of -cell function , which may be a mechanism to avoid hypoglycemic episodes.36 such an inverse relationship between insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion indicates that it is impossible to judge insulin secretion in a given individual without knowing the ambient insulin sensitivity , since both increases and decreases of insulin sensitivity are associated with compensatory reciprocal changes in insulin secretion . in brief , the present study demonstrated that the dlbs3233 treatment augmented insulin sensitivity and simultaneously preserved the performance of -cell in regulating insulin secretion .\nthe finding also indicated a more effective utilization of insulin by both the liver and peripheral tissues .\nwe also noted that even though preservation or improvement of -cell performance did not occur in placebo group , the insulin sensitivity index ( homa - ir ) was better than the corresponding baseline .\nthe improvement observed in placebo group was possibly attributed to the lifestyle education given to all study subjects during their participation in the study .\nlifestyle changes have been proven to delay the progression of igt to type-2-diabetes.37 however , non - adherence to the lifestyle modification for a long period is a major constraint .\ntherefore , the use of pharmacological therapy , such as dlbs3233 , is likely to offset , at least in part , the adverse impacts of non - adherence to lifestyle changes .\nabout one - third of subjects in dlbs3233 and placebo groups had dyslipidemia , but all had been adequately treated before screening .\ntherefore , at study entry , the average triglyceride levels of both groups were within the normal range .\nhowever , since the insulin resistance was markedly improved with dlbs3233 , it was not surprising that a substantial reduction of triglyceride level from baseline was still observed in that group , after 8 and 12 weeks of treatment . at both time points ,\nthe findings of this study were consistent with the results of our previous study in insulin - resistant wistar rats.20 the augmentation of insulin sensitivity found in this study can be explained by the action of dlbs3233 in modulating the expression of genes associated with insulin signaling and sensitivity , such as peroxisome proliferators - activator receptor ( ppar)- and ppar-. in vitro studies with 3t3-swiss - albino preadipocyte cells showed that stimulation of insulin - signaling transduction by dlbs3233 occurred through the promotion of tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin - receptor - substrate and upregulation of the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase , ppar- , ppar- , and glucose transporter-4 at the mrna level.20,21 activation of ppar- and ppar- by dlbs3233 leads to a series of beneficial metabolic effects on glucose and lipids , suggesting that the product possesses the potential capacity to decrease the incidence of insulin resistance - associated diseases .\nthe mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of dlbs3233 on bp is probably associated with the reduced plasma insulin level and improvement of insulin resistance .\nit has been widely known that insulin resistance , through a complex physiological interaction with hyperinsulinemia makes an independent contribution to the elevation of bp.38 therefore , improvement in insulin sensitivity will produce a certain reduction in bp , independent of other factors.39 other drugs that improve insulin sensitivity also demonstrated their effects in lowering bp , such as rosiglitazone,39 pioglitazone,18 and metformin.40 the data suggest that along with its virtues on glucose metabolism , dlbs3233 might also provide protection against the development of cardiovascular disease in prediabetic subjects . whether or not dlbs3233 has direct effects on the vascular system\nwith respect to the safety parameters , the reductions in serum alt and alkaline phosphatase observed with dlbs3233 were all not clinically significant , indicating the safety of treatment , with a trend of protective effect on the liver .\na slight increase of the level of serum creatinine observed at the end of treatment with dlbs3233 was still far below the uln , and the increment was not clinically significant either .\nno serious or severe vascular - related adverse events occurred in either group during the study .\neven edema which was commonly found with use of insulin sensitizers was not found with dlbs3233 treatment .\nsignificant reduction of body weight from baseline was observed in both groups , but still , there was no significant difference between groups .\nother than appendicitis which was unlikely to have causal relationship with the study product , all adverse events were mild in severity .\nfirst , we had limited control of the implementation of lifestyle modification during the study , where only lifestyle education and motivation were provided on a regular basis .\nhowever , employing random allocation in the study should ensure the equal distribution between groups , of adherent and non - adherent subjects to lifestyle modification .\nthe second limitation is that the duration of this study was too short for us to evaluate the ultimate goal of treating igt subjects , that is , the prevention of conversion to type-2-diabetes .\nhowever , this study may serve as a sound ground to justify a larger outcome research with a longer duration of treatment and more refined study design to evaluate the risk reduction of type-2-diabetes by dlbs3233 treatment in prediabetic subjects and to confirm the real benefits of dlbs3233 treatment in prediabetes .\nthis study demonstrated that dlbs3233 treatment at the dose of 50100 mg once daily was promisingly efficacious in improving insulin sensitivity and preserving the performance of -cells .\nthe product was also very well tolerated without unfavorable effects on then cardiovascular system , such as weight gain and edema ."}
{"id": 111, "text": "  temporomandibular disorders ( tmds ) represent a wide range of functional changes and pathological conditions affecting the temporomandibular joint ( tmj ) , masticatory muscles , and other components of the oromaxillofacial region . in recent years\nthe number of patients with tmds is increasing , probably due to psychological tension in modern society . according to well - accepted psychophysiological concepts , occlusal problems and emotional stress\na comprehensive understanding requires consideration of the whole masticatory apparatus and the intra - articular situation . due to the largely nonspecific nature of initial problems ,\npatients are not typically referred to specialists until symptoms have evolved and , in many cases , after irreversible morphological and functional changes have occurred .\ncharacteristic symptoms of tmj disorders include pain , changes in mandibular mobility ( reduced mouth opening ( hypomobility ) or , in contrast , hypermobility and luxation ) , clicking , and grinding .  \nconservative treatments include the use of bite wafers , rehabilitation exercises , isometric exercises , masticatory muscle massage , analgesic treatment , thermotherapy , and laser therapy .\nsurgical treatments can be invasive ( open approaches ) or minimally invasive , including arthrocentesis and arthroscopy .   new insights into the joint pathology of internal derangements have been provided by observations made during tmj arthroscopic lysis and lavage and analysis of the outcomes of such treatments .\nthe physical actions of lysis and lavage in the superior joint space , which reduce inflammation rather than repositioning the disc , are believed to be responsible for the success of arthroscopic surgery [ 9 , 10 ] .\nthis finding has increased the use of tmj arthrocentesis procedures to obtain symptomatic relief and restore the normal range of motion   and has made more aggressive approaches , such as disc replacement or repair , condylar shaving , and high condylectomy , less common .   in this study\n, we sought to analyse the clinical results and eventual anatomical changes induced by arthrocentesis in the treatment of internal derangement of the tmj . to our knowledge , this study is the first to evaluate the clinical outcomes of arthrocentesis by comparing pre- and posttreatment morphological parameters using cone - beam computed tomography ( cbct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .\nin this prospective clinical study , clinical and imaging data from 30 consecutive patients treated with tmj arthrocentesis and sodium hyaluronate ( sh ) injection were analysed .\nthe investigation was conducted according to the principles of the 1975 helsinki declaration for biomedical research involving human subjects , as revised in 2004 , and was approved by the research committee of the department of surgical , microsurgical , and medical science , university of sassari . at preliminary visits ,\npatients of any ethnic group and gender who were aged 18 years , in good general health , and physically and psychologically able to undergo tmj arthrocentesis were included in the study .\ninclusion criteria were tmj pain at rest or evoked by palpation , mandibular distraction or forced opening manoeuvres , mandibular hypomobility , tmj noises or clicking , failure of conservative treatments alone ( nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) and gnathological treatment ) , and concomitant occlusal bite therapy .\nexclusion criteria were degenerative joint diseases , such as osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , and gout ; history of condylar fractures or tmj trauma ; previous tmj surgery ; and poor compliance . according to these criteria ,\npatients ' informed consent was obtained before clinical examinations were conducted and medical histories were collected .\npatients ' records were reviewed retrospectively to collect data on demographic characteristics , histories , preoperative physical examination findings ( pain , joint noises , and dysfunction ) , and the results of mri and cbct analyses .\ntwo major categories of tmj disorder were encountered : anterior disc displacement ( ad ; n = 26 patients , group a ) and other less common disorders , such as osteophytes , signs of soft - tissue inflammation , and tmj structural alterations ( n = 4 , group b ) .\nmri was performed using the following parameters : 3  mm section thickness , 320  224 matrix , and 120  120  mm field of view .\nsequential bilateral oblique sagittal images were acquired with the subject 's mouth closed and at the maximum open - mouth position .\nan independent radiologist blinded to the patients ' data assessed mri data using established criteria .\njoint status was first assessed by determining whether the disc was positioned normally , defined as the superior location ( 12 o'clock position ) of the posterior band of the disc relative to the condyle , or whether ad was present .\ndeformity was then assessed by evaluating biconcave disc morphology , enlargement of the posterior band , and thickness .\ndisc dynamics were categorised as mobile or immobile ( fixed or  stuck  in closed and open positions ) .\nosteoarthrosis ( oa ) was defined by the presence of condylar deformities associated with flattening , subchondral sclerosis , surface irregularities , erosion , and osteophytes .\non t2-weighted images , je was identified as an area of high signal intensity in the region of the joint space .\nbone marrow oedema ( bmo ) was defined by the presence of a hypointense signal on t1-weighted images and a hyperintense signal on t2-weighted images .\nall abnormalities , such as the presence of osteophytes , geodesic erosion of the cavity , and morphological changes , were recorded .\nlinear and angular measurements were made to evaluate the mediolateral orientation of the condyle on axial views and the positions and orientations of the mandibular condyles with respect to the cavity walls on sagittal and coronal views ( figure 1 ) .\nthe following landmarks and reference planes were involved : point x : on a sagittal view , the most prominent point of the outline of the ventral condyle corresponding to the insertion of the anterior joint capsule;point y : the most cranial point on the cranial contour of the condyle;point z : the dorsal condylar projection of point x in the horizontal plane;condylar angle : formed between the major mediolateral axis of the condyle and the axis drawn between the most projecting points of the dorsal surfaces of the two mandibular condyles ( this measurement defined the orientation of the condyle in the horizontal plane);line ab : the maximum mediolateral width of the condyle;line cd : the maximum dorsoventral width of the condyle;line ef : the maximum craniocaudal length of the condyle;line gh : the maximum dorsoventral length of the glenoid fossa;d1 : distance between the condyle ( point z ) and the temporal bone;d2 : distance between the condyle ( point x ) and the articular eminence;d3 : distance between the condyle ( point y ) and the posterior wall of the glenoid fossa;d4 : distance between the condyle and the medial wall of the glenoid fossa.all cbct measurements were taken before treatment and repeated 60 days after - treatment .\npoint x : on a sagittal view , the most prominent point of the outline of the ventral condyle corresponding to the insertion of the anterior joint capsule ; point y : the most cranial point on the cranial contour of the condyle ; point z : the dorsal condylar projection of point x in the horizontal plane ; condylar angle : formed between the major mediolateral axis of the condyle and the axis drawn between the most projecting points of the dorsal surfaces of the two mandibular condyles ( this measurement defined the orientation of the condyle in the horizontal plane ) ; line ab : the maximum mediolateral width of the condyle ; line cd : the maximum dorsoventral width of the condyle ; line ef : the maximum craniocaudal length of the condyle ; line gh : the maximum dorsoventral length of the glenoid fossa ;

d4 : distance between the condyle and the medial wall of the glenoid fossa .   the following parameters were also evaluated : pain , measured with a visual analogue scale ( vas ; figure 2);maximum mouth opening ( mmo ) , measured between the incisal edges of the maxillary and mandibular incisors;presence or absence of articular noises .\npain , measured with a visual analogue scale ( vas ; figure 2 ) ; maximum mouth opening ( mmo ) , measured between the incisal edges of the maxillary and mandibular incisors ; presence or absence of articular noises .   at follow - up visits\n, patients were also invited to complete an original satisfaction form , assessing treatment effectiveness ( benefit to the patient ) and tolerability on scales ranging from 0 to 4 ( 0 , poor ; 1 , mild ; 2 , moderate ; 3 , good ; 4 , very good ) .  \npretreatment and posttreatment mmo and levels of pain and dysfunction were compared using paired and unpaired t - tests , and mcnemar 's test was used to evaluate mri and cbct changes ( p < 0.05 ) .\nthe patient was seated at a 45 angle , and the sites of needle insertion were marked on the skin according to the method suggested by nitzan et al . .\nthe first point , corresponding to the glenoid fossa , was marked 10  mm from the midtragus and 2  mm below the canthotragal line .\na second point , corresponding to the articular eminence , was marked 10  mm from the first point and 10  mm below the line .\nthen , 2  ml articaine chlorhydrate with 1  :  100,000 adrenaline ( pierrel s.p.a . ,\nmilan , italy ) was injected to block the articular branch of the auriculotemporal nerve .\nthe patient was asked to open the mouth wide , and the mandible was held in the protruded position .\na 19-gauge needle was then introduced at the first point , and 24  ml nacl solution ( 0.9% saline ) was injected to fill the joint space .\nanother 19-gauge needle was then inserted at the second point to establish flow of the solution through the joint space .\nsaline was then injected under pressure through the first needle into the superior joint space ; the second needle provided the outflow . in total , 300400  ml nacl solution ( 0.9% saline ) was used for lavage ( figure 3 ) .\nfinally , 2  ml sh ( hyalgan , fidia , italy ) was injected into the superior joint space before removal of the needles .\nthe patient 's mandible was gently manipulated in the vertical , protrusive , and lateral directions to free up the disc .\nmri : presence of disc interference , change in the position or conditions of the articular disc , and change in the relationship with the mandibular condyle.cbct : morphometric changes in the mandibular condyle and glenoid cavity.disappearance or significant reduction in pain , assessed using a vas.change in mmo.disappearance , reduction , or increase in articular noise.pre- and posttreatment clinical parameters were compared using paired and unpaired t - tests , and mcnemar 's test was used to evaluate cbct and mri changes .\nmri : presence of disc interference , change in the position or conditions of the articular disc , and change in the relationship with the mandibular condyle .\ncbct : morphometric changes in the mandibular condyle and glenoid cavity . disappearance or significant reduction in pain , assessed using a vas .\nin total , 30 consecutive patients ( 24 women , 6 men ; age , 2562 years ) with tmj disorders for which conservative management had failed were selected for this study .\ndisc displacement was observed in 26 patients , and only four patients presented other tmj disorders ( osteophytes , signs of soft - tissue inflammation , and tmj structural alterations ) .\nall patients had moderate to severe pain , with preoperative vas scores ranging from 6 to 10 ( mean , 8.26  0.88 ) .\npain decreased significantly ( p < 0.001 ) during the long - term follow - up period , with posttreatment vas scores ranging from 0 to 9 ( mean , 2.03  2.80 ) .\nboth groups also showed significant reductions in pain ( p < 0.001 ) when analysed individually .\nvas scores decreased significantly ( p < 0.001 ) in the group with ad from a preoperative mean of 8.45  0.75 ( range , 710 ) to a long - term postoperative mean of 1.77  2.49 ( range , 09 ) . in the group with other disorders , preoperative vas scores ranged from 6 to 8 ( mean , 7.25  0.95 ) preoperatively and from 0 to 9 ( mean , 3.5  4.35 ) at the final follow - up evaluation ( table 1 ) . \n\ntable 1 summarises the findings of preoperative , immediately postoperative , and final clinical examinations .\nall patients experienced a significant increase in mmo ( p < 0.001 ) immediately after arthrocentesis .\npreoperative mmo values ranged from 20 to 40  mm ( mean , 25.3  5.5  mm ) , whereas postoperative mmo values ranged from 30 to 55  mm ( mean , 43.8    5.6  mm ) . at 1-year follow - up evaluations , mmo values ranged from 15 to 50  mm ( mean , 37.1  8.4  mm ) , representing a significant increase from pretreatment values ( p < 0.001 ) . in patients with ad ,\nimmediate postoperative and long - term postoperative mmo values were significantly higher than prearthrocentesis values ( p < 0.001 ) .\nmmo values ranged from 20 to 40  mm ( mean , 25.3  5.7  mm ) before arthrocentesis , from 30 to 55  mm ( mean , 43.2  5.5  mm ) immediately after treatment , and from 25 to 50  mm ( mean , 37.6  6.3  mm ) 1 year after treatment . in patients with other disorders , immediate postoperative and long - term postoperative mmo values were also significantly higher than pretreatment values ( p < 0.001 ) .\npretreatment mmo values ranged from 20 to 30  mm ( mean , 25.2  4.9 mm ) , immediate posttreatment values ranged from 40 to 53  mm ( mean , 47.0  5.7  mm ) , and long - term posttreatment values ranged from 15 to 45  mm ( mean , 34.5  13.3  mm ; table 2 ) . before arthrocentesis ,\n53.8% of patients had clinically detectable joint noises ; this proportion increased to 76.9% immediately after the procedure .\njoint noises increased from 45% to 72% in patients with ad ( group a ) but were not affected by arthrocentesis in patients with other disorders . in the 26 patients with ad ,\ntwo of eight je cases persisted after treatment ( p = 0.15 ) ( figure 4 ) .\nbmo was present in eight joints and did not disappear in any case ( figure 4 ) .\nposttreatment cbct images showed no significant change in the tmj bony structure ( table 4 ) .\npatients ' subjective scoring of treatment effectiveness yielded an average value of 3.45 , corresponding to a good degree of satisfaction .\nthe tolerability of arthrocentesis was between  moderate  and  good  , with an average score of 2.45 .\n  inflammatory and noninflammatory tmj diseases are typically associated with structural alterations in joint tissues , such as cartilage degradation and subchondral bone alterations , which reflect the responses of cells , extracellular matrix macromolecules , collagen , and proteoglycans to articular load changes . in inflammatory tmj diseases , various mediators  particularly cytokines\n may be responsible for rearrangement of the extracellular matrix in joint tissues , altering normal cell reactions and allowing enzymatic degradation of the matrix .\ncollagenases and matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) , zinc - containing proteins with enzymatic activity , likely play roles in this process .\nmacromolecular degradation of the matrix determines physical and biological deterioration of the tissues and promotes the disease , because the degradation fragments , proteoglycans , and collagen released into the synovial fluid generate inflammatory pain , with further release of mmps .   despite clinical evidence of disc displacement in tmj internal derangement\n, current concepts suggest that a change in disc position is not a primary factor in tmj pain or dysfunction . instead\n, alterations in joint pressure ( negative intra - articular pressure ) and a variety of biochemical constituents of the synovial fluid ( failure of lubrication ) may lead to clicking and derangement of the tmj [ 9 , 12 , 13 ] .   thus , arthrocentesis may act by allowing the elimination of hyperviscous medium with catabolites and inflammatory cells , thereby counteracting the degeneration of tissues .\nhyaluronic acid is the main component of the synovial fluid and cartilage matrix ; it plays an important role in homeostasis of the tmj due to its important viscoelastic properties , with a  bearing effect  against impact , and its analgesic effect .\nhyaluronic acid can reduce the production of proinflammatory substances and vascular permeability and protect cell damage mediated by free radicals .\nin addition to an immediate response ( e.g. , improved mastication ability ) , it also induces long - term modifications , as is typical of structure - modifying drugs .\nhyaluronate thus has a slow symptomatic action , but is persistent , with a so - called  tail effect .  in regeneration induced in degenerated arthritic tissues with slow metabolism , injection of exogenous hyaluronic acid stimulates the production of endogenous hyaluronate by synoviocytes .\nthe immediate action , however , is explained by a reduction in pain mediators when infiltrated into an inflamed joint with hypomobility and functional limitations .  \ndegenerative joint disease is characterised by decreased concentration , molecular weight , and degree of polymerisation of endogenous hyaluronic acid , which involves reduced viscosity of the liquid , resulting in increased susceptibility to damage of the articular heads due to cartilage erosion mediated by exogenous phospholipases .  \nlavage of the upper joint space reduces pain by removing inflammatory mediators from the joint and increases mandibular mobility by removing intra - articular adhesions , eliminating the negative pressure within the joint , recovering disc and fossa space , and improving disc mobility , which reduces the mechanical obstruction caused by ad [ 1318 ] .  \narthrocentesis has developed as a natural consequence of the success of arthroscopic lavage and lysis for the treatment of internal derangements .\ndescribed arthrocentesis as the simplest form of surgery in the tmj , seeking to release the articular disc and to remove adhesions between the disc surface and the mandibular fossa by means of hydraulic pressure from irrigation of the upper chamber of the tmj [ 12 , 14 , 16 , 25 ] .\nstudies to determine whether the effects of arthrocentesis on internal derangements are merely palliative or provide long - term relief of the associated symptoms have shown that arthrocentesis can produce long - term relief of pain and dysfunction in patients with internal derangements of the tmj [ 19 , 20 ] .  \narthrocentesis has been reported to be up to 91% effective in treating patients with ad without reduction [ 15 , 21 , 22 ] . in this study ,\nthis pain reduction is attributed to high - pressure irrigation , which washes away inflammatory mediators , providing immediate pain relief .\nfailure of pain relief may be due to pain originating from causes other than internal derangement .\narthrocentesis under sufficient pressure can also remove adhesions , widen joint spaces , and improve mouth opening [ 9 , 23 , 24 ] . in patients who presented with limited mouth opening\n, significant improvement was seen in the immediate postoperative period ; along with a reduction in pain , mouth opening increased further from months 3 to 6 .\nin which tmj arthrocentesis fails to achieve the desired outcome , several factors should be considered .\nappropriate case selection is important , because this technique seems to be ineffective in certain conditions , such as in cases with bony changes , fibroankylosis , and perforation of the disc [ 23 , 25 ] .\neven when these indications are evident , other associated factors , such as muscle spasm , must also be brought under control prior to arthrocentesis . when arthroscopy or open joint surgery is indicated , but the clinician is uncertain of the diagnosis , arthrocentesis may be used as a simple interim measure that can confirm the need for more invasive procedures [ 16 , 26 ] .  \nmajor disadvantages of arthrocentesis are the failure to directly show intra - articular pathology , the scarce possibility of pathological tissue biopsy , and the difficulty of treating more mature adhesions . sweeping and other nonoperative arthroscopic manoeuvres , which can be performed with arthroscopic lysis and lavage , are not possible with arthrocentesis alone .\ntransient facial paresis due to the local anaesthetic or swelling of the neighbouring tissues caused by perfusion of solution may occur during arthrocentesis .\nradiographic assessment of the temporomandibular joint using cbct imaging allows clinicians to find out subtle osteoarthrosis alterations such as subchondral cysts and sclerosis , osteophyte formation , surface erosion , and bony remodeling .\nthe mri allows to evaluate the morphologic features of the disc and its location with respect to the condyle in both closed and open - mouth positions .\nother mri signs that can suggest tmj dysfunction include thickening , perforations of retrodiscal layers , or joint effusion .\nmri therefore allows to detect degenerative signs , invisible to cbct , allowing early precise diagnosis of different tmj disorders .   thereby comparative imaging studies can prevent possible evolution to more advanced and irreversible phases , characterized by osteoarthrosis changes\n  arthrocentesis of the tmj is a minimally invasive method of treatment , located at the boundary between conservative and surgical therapy .\nit is used for acute closed or open lock caused by displacement of the articular disc and for the treatment of degenerative inflammatory joint disease .\nthe main objectives of arthrocentesis are to wash out inflammatory mediators , release the disc , break up adhesions , eliminate pain , and improve joint mobility .\nit is a method with a minimum number of complications ; it is simple and not demanding in terms of instruments , and it can be performed repeatedly .\nthese features make arthrocentesis a valid treatment option for patients with low and mild tmj disorders ."}

{"id": 115, "text": "humans tend to assume that our vision represents the world as it is ; that , for example , an object appears red because that object is red . however , the colours that objects appear depend on the colour vision of the observer , and humans actually have a rare form of colour vision among all animals ( e.g. bowmaker , 1998 ; jacobs , 1993 ) .\nthe early vertebrates were probably tetrachromatic and many fish , reptiles and birds remain so  meaning they have four types of cone receptor .\nearly mammals lost this multidimensional colour vision and became dichromatic , retaining only the cone classes sensitive to the longest and shortest wavelengths .\nan ancestor to african and asian primates , with which we share our type of colour vision , reinvented full trichromatic vision from these dichromatic ancestors , so that we now have three types of cone  shortwave ( s ) , mediumwave ( m ) and longwave ( l)two of which , l and m , remain similar to each other in many ways because they are the offspring of the same ancestral mammalian longwave cone .\nmost placental mammals have remained dichromatic , possessing s and l cones , while some groups have reduced to just l cones ( and rods ) .\nthe reason why primates bucked this trend has been the focus of a long - running debate .\nthe main theories have suggested that the key selective advantage of trichromacy for primates lay in foraging , either for fruit ( allen , 1879 ; mollon , 1989 ; osorio & vorobyev , 1996 ; polyak , 1957 ; regan et al . ,\n1998 , 2001 ; riba - hernandez , stoner , & osorio , 2004 ; steward & cole , 1989 ) or for young leaves ( dominy & lucas , 2001 ; sumner & mollon , 2000a ) among the ubiquitous forest background of mature leaves .\n, we ask whether the key task might have been spotting food from a distance , or efficiently picking food once it is within reach ( i.e. food detection or food selection ; lucas et al . , 2003 ) .\nparraga , troscianko , and tolhurst ( 2002 ) compared the spatiochromatic properties of calibrated natural images , including those of fruit on leafy backgrounds with the properties of the three early channels of human vision : the  lm  colour pathway , which compares l cone signals with m cone signals ( this pathway is often called  red  green ,  but this is slightly misleading ) ; the  s - lm  pathway comparing s cone signals with pooled l and m signals ( this pathway is often called  blue  yellow ,  but this is highly misleading ) , and an achromatic pathway . it is the ability to compare l with m signals that was new in primate trichromacy , and parraga et al .\n( 2002 ) found that the spatiochromatic properties of this channel are optimized for encoding reddish or yellowish fruit or leaves on a background of foliage at relatively small viewing distances .\nin other words , our lm system is optimized for picking fruit or edible leaves , rather than for spotting them from a distance .\ndoes it follow that picking food was the critical task driving the natural selection of primate trichromacy ?\nwe can not necessarily make this inference because natural selection is not driven by what a phenotype might be best at , but by the advantage that phenotype offers over other competing phenotypes . even though the lm pathway may be best at selecting food close up , the biggest advantage over dichromacy might still be at spotting fruit at a distance .\nin fact , other authors have explicitly assumed that the biggest advantage lay in spotting food from a distance ( dominy , lucas , osorio , & yamashita , 2001 ; lucas et al .\n, 2003 ; regan et al . , 1998 , 2001 ; sumner & mollon , 2000a , 2000b ) .\nfor example , regan et al . and sumner & mollon modelled the task of finding fruit or young leaves in foliage for all plausible sensitivity functions that the l and m cones might take , in order to work out which combination of potential l and m cones would be optimal .\nit turned out that the optimal pair are very close to what we actually possess , supporting the argument that finding important objects amongst foliage was a driving force in the evolution of the lm colour channel .\nthis approach did not incorporate the spatial properties of the system , unlike parraga et al .\n( 2002 ) but a component of the modelling  the estimation of quantum noise  did require the viewing distance of the stimuli to be specified .\nthese studies explicitly assumed the key task was spotting food from a distance rather than picking food close up , and thus chose distances of about 10 m. behavioural evidence in favour of either task is circumstantial .\nsouth american monkeys have been the main focus of study because they are polymorphic in their colour vision ( mollon , bowmaker , & jacobs , 1984 ) ; within the same species , some individuals can have trichromacy , while others have dichromacy ( we will return to this in the discussion section ) .\nthese species offer the opportunity of natural experiments , comparing the behaviour of trichromatic individuals with dichromatic individuals , either in zoos or in the wild .\ncaine and mundy ( 2000 ) tested marmosets in visual search tasks in a naturalized captive setting .\nin one task , they scattered edible orange or green cereal balls in the cage , which required viewing from up to 6 m away , while in the other task the  targets  were placed on a tray among green wood shavings and viewed close up ( < 0.5 m ) .\nan advantage for trichromats was evident only for the longer distance task , but the backgrounds for the visual search were not matched across tasks ( the primary aim of the study was to establish whether the trichromats had an advantage in any task rather than to formally test the distance manipulation ) .\nsince then , there has been no distance manipulation within the same study , and it has been surprisingly difficult for researchers to observe any significant behavioural differences between trichromatic and dichromatic monkeys in the wild . in a captive environment ,\nthe foraging advantage of trichromats has been replicated with tamarins finding simulated fruits in simulated leaves , but there was no distance manipulation ( smith , buchanan - smith , surridge , osorio , & mundy , 2003b ) . in the wild , smith et al .\n( 2003b ) found a hint that trichromatic moustached tamarins might be more likely to lead the troop into fruiting trees than dichromats , consistent with an advantage in spotting fruit , but this was not consistent and it was not the case that all troops of tamarins were led by trichromats ( saddleback tamarins were mainly male - led , who are all dichromats ) .\nsimilarly , bunce , isbell , grote , and jacobs ( 2011 ) found a hint that wild trichromatic titi monkeys found small patches of red or yellow fruit more often than their dichromatic conspecifics .\nhowever , the only significant observed advantage in wild monkeys has been capuchins selecting fruit at arms ' reach ( melin et al . , 2009 ) , where trichromats accepted ( i.e. ate ) more of the fruit they picked , sniffed fruit less , and had shorter foraging sequences than dichromats did .\nhowever , this apparent advantage for picking fruit does not appear to translate into consuming more food overall in trichromatic capuchins or spider monkeys ( hiramatsu et al .\n, 2008 ; melin et al . , 2009 ; vogel , neitz , & dominy , 2007 ) . moreover , hiramatsu et al .\n( 2008 ) found that luminance , rather than colour , was the cue that best predicts foraging efficiency at grasping distance ( for the fruits in their study at least ) .\nadditionally , olfaction and tactile cues can be available , reducing the importance of trichromacy ( hiramatsu et al .\n, 2009 ; lucas et al . , 2003 ; steward & cole , 1989 ) . thus , it remains unclear whether we should expect the greatest advantage of human - like trichromacy to be in the longer distance task of spotting food , or the close - up task of picking it .\nthe aim of our experiment was to simulate the competition to find fruit between two primates ( in this case humans ) in a naturalistic visual search task of real fruit in real foliage .\nwe tested  normal  trichromats , dichromats and anomalous trichromats who have less separation between the l and m cone sensitivity functions than do \nwe included anomalous trichromats both to boost  colour - deficient  participant numbers ( dichromats are relatively rare , 2% of the male population ) , and because evolutionarily the competing state to what we now consider normal trichromacy has almost certainly been  anomalous  trichromacy as well as dichromacy .\nthe task was to count the number of  ripe fruit  hanging in a real bush from a distance of 1 , 4 , 8 or 12 m ( figure 1 ) .\nwe used segments of yellow pepper as targets because they display spectral and thus chromatic properties representative of many fruit favoured by primates in a ugandan rainforest ( figures 2 and 3 ) .\nthe task was performed simultaneously by a pair of participants , one dichromat or anomalous trichromat and one  normal  trichromat matched as closely as possible for age , sex , experience of visual experiments and knowledge of colour vision .\neach pair performed the task simultaneously so that they were exposed to the identical trial sequence and lighting conditions ( cloudy or sunny ) .\nthis set - up also engendered some aspect of competition between the pair , simulating the competition for fruit of two primates simultaneously foraging in the same tree .\nthe upper panel shows two participants during a trial at 4 m with three targets .\nboth have removed their blindfolds and opened their eyes in order to search the shrub .\nthe lower panel shows the shrub with the eight potential target positions marked with red circles .\ne.g. panel a : samples of unripe , green , and ripe , yellow , chrysophyllum albidum ) , we chose segments yellow pepper as targets and green pepper as distractors ( b ) , because they have similar reflectance spectra ( c ) and chromatic properties ( figure 3 ) .\n stimuli ( b ) subtended approximately 2 , 0.5 , 0.25 and 0.16 degrees of visual angle for distances 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 m. in panel ( c ) , thin orange and green lines are ripe and unripe ugandan fruit chrysophyllum albidum , orange and green thick lines are  ripe  and  unripe \nsegments of yellow / orange and green pepper used as targets and distractors overlap in their chromatic properties ( orange and green filled circles ) with some fruits eaten by primates in uganda ( unfilled circles ) .\nthe leaves from the experimental bush ( grey squares ) also show similar properties to leaves in a ugandan rainforest ( open squares ) .\nnormal trichromats made faster responses and fewer errors than their colour - deficient competitors , as expected ( mean rts 4.7 vs. 6.4 s ; error score 0.17 vs. 0.54 ; all errors were  misses , \nour unit of analysis is the pairwise comparison between the members of each matched pair .\nas shown in figures 4(a and b ) , the relative advantage increased with distance , both for response time and errors [ one - way anovas , f(3,21 ) = 9.7 , p < 0.001 and f(3,30 ) = 4.0 , p < 0.02 ; see the methods section for subject numbers and other details ] . in figures 4(a and\nb ) , the difference in performance ( rt or error ) between the colour - deficient member and the colour - normal member of each pair was divided by the overall mean rt or error of that pair , in order to control for different overall performance and speed  accuracy trade - offs ( range in mean rt , 3.412.8 s and in mean error score 0.150.57 ; the behaviour of each member was correlated , r = 0.76 for rt and r = 0.32 for errors , probably because they influenced each other in this regard , as would be expected , and/or because they had correlated age , experience and testing conditions ) .\na and b ) , the difference in performance ( rt or error ) between the colour - deficient member and the colour - normal member of each pair was divided by the overall mean rt or error of that pair , in order to control for different overall performance and speed  accuracy trade - offs . in panel\n( c ) , the rt for the colour - deficient member of each pair in each condition is simply divided by the rt of the colour - normal member ( which is a simpler analysis and also controls for differences in baseline speed with distance ) .\nthis analysis could not be done reliably for error scores because there were many instances of dividing by zero or near - zero bins .\nthe dashed and dotted lines show the subsets of results for dichromats and anomalous trichromats ( each compared with their matched normal trichromat ) .\nfigure 4(c ) shows that the same pattern [ f(3,21 ) = 5.6 , p = 0.005 ] occurred for the mean ratio of response times of the colour - normal and colour - deficient members of each pair .\nthe dashed and dotted lines in figures 4(a  c ) show the subsets of results for dichromats and anomalous trichromats ( each compared with their matched normal trichromat ) , indicating that the effect on response time is greater for full dichromats [ interaction f(3,18 ) = 3.4 , p < 0.05 ] , as would be expected .\nthe same pattern is not evident in the error scores , but this could be a simple lack of power or a difference in speed accuracy strategy between groups . note that the key comparison was between the colour - deficient and normal trichromatic member of each pair , not between dichromats and anomalous trichromats , because although the dichromats and anomalous trichromats were each matched in age and relevant experience to their control trichromats , dichromats and anomalous trichromats could not be matched in age or experience with each other .\nthe mean age of the dichromats was 10 years older than that of the anomalous trichromats .\nour results show that in our naturalistic visual search task with human observers , the advantage of normal trichromacy over dichromacy or anomalous trichromacy increased with distance ( even without the additional cues of smell and touch available to foraging monkeys ) .\nthe advantage was greatest when the stimuli subtended no more than 0.2 degrees at the eye .\nthis is likely to be because visual cues such as shape and the s/(l+m ) dimension of colour vision decrease with distance for small targets .\nfor very small stimuli , the absence of s cones in the very centre of the fovea ( about the central 1/3 of a degree of visual angle ) , precludes information in the s/(l+m ) pathway for fixated targets ( known as  small field tritanopia  ) , although the effect of this is less when observers scan a scene , as in the present task ( e.g. mccree , 1960 ) .\nalthough we used fruit not young ( reddish or yellowish ) leaves as targets , we see no reason that our findings would not extend to such leaves , which are also important sources of food for some species of primate .\nour results imply that the more important task for the natural selection of primate trichromacy may have been spotting food from a distance rather than picking it at arms ' length .\nthis in no way challenges the previous finding that the lm colour channel is optimal at the close - up task ( parraga et al . , 2002 ) .\nthe biggest advantage of one phenotype over competing phenotypes does not have to arise for the task that the phenotype is best at .\nhowever , while the spatial - frequency sensitivity of the lm system undoubtedly makes it optimal at the close - up task , our results do raise the question of whether it has been optimized by that task .\nrather , its optimality may have emerged as a side effect of the combined pressures of the longer distance task and other constraints , such as the random layout of l and m cones on the retina ( deeb , 2006 ) and the unavoidable fact that both colour resolution and achromatic resolution can not be equally high because they are conflated in the most fine scale comparison of neighbouring cones .\none general puzzle is why it has been so difficult to observe any behavioural advantages for trichromats over dichromats in the wild , when they have been apparent as expected in experiments such as this one and those on captive tamarins and marmosets ( caine & mundy , 2000 ; smith et al . , 2003b ) .\nmost studies in the wild have concentrated on observing monkeys picking fruit ( e.g. hiramatsu et al .\n, 2008 ; melin et al . , 2009 ; vogel et al . , 2007 ) , where our results predict the advantage is smallest , even without the extra tactile and olfactory cues available in the wild but not in our experiment .\nunfortunately , it is very difficult to discern and quantify the longer distance task except by observing troop leadership , which is known to be influenced by other social factors which might mask any effect of colour vision ( smith , buchanan - smith , surridge , & mundy , 2003a ) .\nanother possibility is that the colour properties of fruits consumed in the forests where these studies have taken place are not fully representative of the gamut of fruits eaten by our ancestors .\nit is difficult to do more than speculate here , but the chromaticity diagrams in hiramatsu et al .\n( 2008 ) , who found no differences in feeding behaviour between dichromatic and trichromatic spider monkeys , show a higher ratio of cryptic fruits ( those that stay green ; see also de araujo , lima , & pessoa , 2006 ) and fruits that turn dark brownish purple ( as do many types of fig ) , and fewer orange or yellow fruit than are found in the diet of primates in uganda ( sumner & mollon , 2000a , 2000b ) .\ncryptic fruits are detected from afar by smell or shape ( and memory ) , and close up by shape , position , smell or feel ( e.g. hiramatsu et al .\n, 2009 ; melin et al . , 2009 ) , all of which dichromats can do at least as well as trichromats .\ndark fruits have , by definition , a strong achromatic signal , which again dichromats can detect at least as well as trichromats ( and possibly are better attuned to ) .\nhowever , viewed amongst foliage from a distance , dark fruits ( unless in a clump ) could easily be mistaken for shadow or gaps , so the use of achromatic cues in fruit foraging remains unclear ( as does the extra cue of glossiness often present in dark fruits ) .\nit would be interesting to test human dichromats and trichromats with fruits showing these properties , such as green and red grapes .\nnote that our targets did also contain a strong luminance signal relative to the foliage background , and of course wild monkeys have a lifetime of practice in fruit picking which acts to diminish any behavioural differences between them .\nfield studies have concentrated on polymorphic species of monkey where some individuals are trichromatic and some are dichromatic , both because this situation makes an ideal natural experiment and because the polymorphism is interesting and rare in itself .\nit arises through there being different alleles of the gene coding the l cone pigment , which give the pigment different sensitivities ( akin to our l and m cones ) .\nif a monkey is homozygous for this gene , they can only have one type of l cone ( in addition to s cones ) , and are thus dichromatic .\nbut if they are heterozygous , and the alleles are expressed in different cones cells , then they possess two types of l cone ( i.e. l and m cones ) and can be trichromatic ( mollon et al . , 1984 ) .\nthe polymorphic gene is on the x chromosome , which means that only females get the opportunity to be heterozygous and thus trichromatic . in many species ,\nthere are three alleles present in different frequencies , which means that approximately 60% of females are trichromatic ( jacobs , neitz , & neitz , 1993 ; williams , hunt , bowmaker , & mollon , 1992 ) .\nbecause trichromacy arises from heterozygosity , rather than from possessing a single advantageous allele , it can not be simply passed on to offspring .\nin fact , there is about equal chance of a dichromatic or trichromatic mother having a trichromatic daughter ( in - breeding avoidance can complicate this , and possibly make dichromats more likely to have trichromatic daughters ; surridge , suarez , buchanan - smith , & mundy , 2005 ) .\nhowever , rare alleles tend to be lost to populations if their presence provides no advantage ( e.g. surridge & mundy , 2002 ) , so it is assumed that to maintain the polymorphism there must be some advantage to trichromacy in the wild that translates into improved fitness ( the potential advantage of having different types of dichromacy in a population has not been given any support ; riba - hernandez et al . , 2004 ) .\non the other hand , if this advantage was very large , there is the obvious question of why full trichromacy has not emerged in these species , as it did for asian and african primates , and has done also for howler monkeys ( jacobs , neitz , deegan , & neitz , 1996 ) .\none possibility is that the genetic event required to allow this is vanishingly rare and simply never happened in those species that remain polymorphic ( regan et al .\n, 2001)a gene duplication is required that puts two different alleles onto the same chromosome alongside working promoter regions and a mechanism for expressing these genes differentially in different cones .\nthe other possibility is that the advantage of trichromacy is much subtler than originally expected when combined with social factors within a polymorphic population ( e.g. bunce et al . , 2011 ;\n, 2003a ) , and may also be offset by some advantages for dichromacy , such as breaking camouflage of cryptic insects ( melin , fedigan , hiramatsu , sendall , & kawamura , 2007 ; regan et al .\n, 2001 ; saito et al . , 2005 ) . either way , given that many species of monkey have successfully survived and diversified over millions of years in which the majority of individuals ( and all the males ) have been dichromatic ( e.g. surridge & mundy , 2002 ) , it should not be surprising that dichromats are not glaringly deficient at any crucial task in the wild that would dramatically harm their chances of survival . from this perspective\n, the advantage of trichromacy is bound to be quite subtle and hard to measure in free - ranging wild monkeys .\nlastly , some authors have suggested that the selective advantage of trichromacy might have been in signalling ( changizi , zhang , & shimojo , 2006 ) .\nmany monkeys have red faces ( and sometimes red sexual signals ) or orange fur markings ( sumner & mollon , 2003 ) .\nmore recent evidence suggests that such signalling post - dates the invention of trichromacy , and thus took advantage of trichromacy once it had arisen , rather than driving its natural selection initially ( fernandez & morris , 2007 ) .\nhowever , it may form part of the selection pressure maintaining it in current populations , as might predator detection ( smith , buchanan - smith , surridge , & mundy , 2005 ; sumner & mollon , 2003 ) .\nin conclusion , we found that in a naturalistic visual search task of finding food in foliage , humans with \nnormal colour vision  diverged in performance from dichromats or anomalous trichromats most for the longest viewing distance ( 12 m ) .\nthis implies that in the natural selection of trichromacy , the task of spotting fruit from a distance was a greater driving force than picking fruit close up .\ncolour -

stranded abu-1 rna markedly impaired survival of cadmium - treated xbp-1 and ire-1 mutant animals , but had minimal impact on survival of cadmium - treated wild - type animals or on survival of untreated xbp-1 and ire-1 mutant animals ( fig . 4 b ) .\nthe inhibition of abu-1 protein expression by abu-1(rnai ) was revealed by the observation that feeding double -

stressed animals\nabu-1::gfp was expressed constitutively in the pharynx and head region of wild - type and xbp-1 mutant adult animals .\nintestinal expression was induced by er stress , most notably in xbp-1 mutant animals ( fig . 5 a ) . the induction of abu-1::gfp in the intestine of cadmium- and tunicamycin - treated animals is consistent with observations that the intestine is active in protein secretion and is a major target for er stress in c. elegans ( fig .\n4 a ) ( shen et al . , 2001 ; calfon et al . ,\nabu-1(rnai ) upregulated the er stress reporter gene hsp-4::gfp in the intestine ( fig . 5 b ) , implying that abu-1 ( and possibly other abu genes )\nmay also be active in the intestine under basal conditions and that interfering with abu function causes er stress .\ngenes active in degradation of malfolded er proteins ( er - associated degradation [ erad ] genes ) are not essential for yeast viability under normal growth conditions but are essential during er stress or when the upr is blocked .\nfurthermore , disruption of erad genes in yeast activates the upr ( casagrande et al . , 2000 ; friedlander et al . , 2000 ;\nwe considered the possibility that abu genes might interact with the process of malfolded protein disposal from the c. elegans er .\nfirst we confirmed that in c. elegans , like yeast , inactivation of erad genes causes er stress .\nrnai of sel-1 , the c. elegans homologue of the yeast erad gene hrd3 ( hampton et al . , 1996 ) , resulted in marked upregulation of the er stress indicator hsp-4::gfp ( fig .\nthe induction of hsp-4::gfp by sel-1(rnai ) and by rnai of a homologue of another yeast erad gene , hrd1 ( encoded in c. elegans by f55a11.3 ) , were both xbp-1 dependent ( unpublished data ) .\ninactivation of sel-1 by rnai had no impact on the viability of wild - type animals and only modestly reduced the viability of xbp-1 mutants . however , when combined with inactivation of abu-1 , sel-1(rnai ) increased lethality of xbp-1 mutant animals ( fig .\nviewed under nomarski optics , the intestine of wild - type , xbp-1 mutant , abu-1(rnai ) , or sel-1(rnai ) young adults had a similar , fine , granular appearance .\nanimals with compound xbp-1;abu-1(rnai ) or xbp-1;sel-1(rnai ) genotypes had more dark staining large intestinal granules .\nthe xbp-1;abu-1(rnai);sel-1(rnai ) animal had a marked increase in such granules ( fig . 5 d ) .\nthese observations suggest that abu-1 ( and possibly other abu genes ) and sel-1 perform partially redundant functions in animals with a blocked upr .\nour search for genes activated in the c. elegans upr revealed similarities to the yeast s. cerevisiae . in both species\nthe upr induces genes that function at many levels of the secretory pathway and encode proteins with diverse and unrelated biochemical activities . in both species ,\nthe signaling pathway initiated by ire1 exerts nearly complete control over the induction of well - characterized components of er client protein processing machinery , such as bip ( hsp-4 ) , protein disulfide isomerases , and 4-prolyl hydroxylases .\nthe application of these stringent statistical criteria eliminated many genes that probably are true upr targets and therefore the list presented in table i is only representative of the most reliably induced upr genes in c. elegans .\nheterogeneity in developmental stage and variation in uptake of drug stand out as likely contributors to the lower power of the whole animal array performed here compared with yeast arrays ( casagrande et al .\n, 2000 ; travers et al . , 2000 ) , and as fig . 1 d shows , the microarray hybridization procedure is also less sensitive than northern blot analysis in detecting fold changes in expression of hsp-4 . despite these limitations , we can firmly conclude that most of the reliably induced upr genes in c. elegans are xbp-1 dependent .\nour genome - wide survey also identified 19 genes that were activated by er stress in xbp-1 mutant animals but not in wild - type animals . among these were nine genes predicted to encode a family of highly related abu proteins .\nthese abu genes are coregulated across different physiological and developmental perturbation ; clustering together in a single , small , isolated and well - defined  expression mountain ,  mount 29 , in the recently established gene expression map of c. elegans ( kim et al . , 2001 ) .\ngfp driven by the promoter of a representative family member , abu-1::gfp , was expressed strongly in the pharynx and head region of transgenic animals from larval stages l3l4 to young adult ( fig . 5 a ) .\na similar expression pattern was also observed in animals transgenic for a transcriptional fusion of gfp to a different abu gene f19g12.7 ( unpublished data ) .\nfurthermore , the basal expression pattern of the abu-1 transcriptional reporters correlated nicely with the in situ hybridization pattern of another abu family member , c03a7.7 .\ntogether , these observations suggest that the abu-1::gfp reporter reflects the activity of the endogenous gene . in older animals , we noted low levels of basal expression of abu-1::gfp in the intestine that was markedly upregulated by er stress in xbp-1 mutant animals ( fig . 5 a ) .\nthis last observation is consistent with the northern blot analysis of abu-1 expression ( fig .\nalthough the significance of basal expression of abu genes in the pharynx is currently not understood , the intestinal expression correlates with the phenotype of animals in which abu-1 had been inactivated by rnai .\nwe do not know if abu-1 induction by er stress in xbp-1 mutant animals is dependent on perk ( pek-1 ) or atf6 ( atf-6 ) signaling , as compound xbp-1;pek-1 and xbp-1;atf-6(rnai ) mutant animals arrest at early larval stages before we could reliably examine abu-1::gfp expression in the gut ( shen et al .\ninactivation of abu-1 by rnai led to marked induction of the er stress indicator hsp-4::gfp in the intestine ( fig .\nthis induction was completely blocked by the xbp-1 mutation ( unpublished data ) , indicating the development of er stress in the gut of abu-1(rnai ) animals and implying that abu-1 plays a role in an er function , which , when inactivated , causes er stress .\nthis er stress appeared to be well tolerated , as the abu-1(rnai ) animals developed at a normal rate and survived exposure to cd , a toxin that induced further er stress .\nhowever , in xbp-1 mutant animals , abu-1(rnai ) had serious consequences , significantly reducing their viability after exposure to additional er stress ( fig . 4 b ) .\nthe abu genes have a very high level of sequence identity at the nucleotide level , and the double - stranded rna used to inactivate abu-1 could also initiate rna inactivation of other family members . it is therefore possible that the strong phenotype observed in the abu-1(rnai ) animals reflects the simultaneous inactivation of other abu family members . collectively , these results point to a role for abu-1 , and possibly other abu genes , in some aspect of er function that is also active under basal conditions . reduced levels of this abu - dependent activity can be compensated by a normal upr . however , when the upr is compromised , loss of this abu - dependent activity becomes limiting , killing the affected animals . in yeast ,\nthe ability to dispose of misfolded proteins in the secretory pathway ( erad ) plays an important role in adapting to high levels of er stress , but is dispensable for viability under normal conditions ( casagrande et al . , 2000 ;\ngiven that abu-1(rnai ) is well tolerated under normal conditions , but not in animals experiencing high levels of er stress , we considered the possibility that the abu genes may interact genetically with components of the c. elegans erad apparatus .\nan interaction was uncovered between sel-1 , a c. elegans gene encoding an er - localized component of the erad apparatus , and abu-1 .\nanimals with diminished xbp-1 , sel-1 , and abu-1 activity had reduced viability and accumulated unusually large vesicles with dark content in their intestinal cells ( fig . 5 d ) .\nsel-1 and abu-1 are unlikely to function in the exact same pathway , as abu-1(rnai ) did not affect the phenotype of a hypomorphic allele of lin-12 , whereas sel-1(rnai ) suppressed the egg - laying defect of lin-12(n676 ; n930)iii ( unpublished data ) . however , the observation that inactivating either gene leads to er stress and the synthetic interactions between them suggest that sel-1 and abu-1 function in interacting cellular processes .\nabu-1 is a transmembrane protein that likely functions within the endomembrane system ( figs . 2 and 3 ) .\nthe lumenal domain of some abu proteins resembles the extracellular domains of a mammalian scavenger receptor and c. elegans ced-1 .\nboth the scavenger receptors and ced-1 are believed to serve as cell surface receptors for chemically modified macromolecules , oxidized lipoproteins , and other altered plasma proteins in the case of the scavenger receptors ( van berkel et al . , 2000 ) and corpses of apoptotic cells in the case of ced-1 ( zhou et al . , 2001 ) .\nscavenger receptors and ced-1 are therefore believed to play a role in recycling the building blocks of damaged macromolecules that are present outside the cell .\nit is possible therefore that the abu proteins may be playing a similar role within the endomembrane system , perhaps by binding to altered er client proteins and modulating their intracellular fate .\nwhole genome hybridization experiments were conducted as previously described ( reinke et al . , 2000 ) . in brief , rna was harvested from untreated and tunicamycin -

up and 50 subjects participated in the present study .\neight participants were excluded from the study , because of improper collection of 24- hour urine , and finally 42 type 2 diabetic patients were studied .\ntwenty -

propanol as a preservative for 24 hours , including final void at completion of 24 hour period.11 this was thoroughly mixed and a sample of 2ml was taken for evaluation of proteins .\nthe proteinuria  300mg / dl in 24-hour urine sample was considered as significant proteinuria.6 a random urine sample of 5ml was collected on next day any time just before the analysis and after completion of 24 hour collection .\nthe fasting blood glucose , glycated hemoglobin , urine creatinine , and urine protein were estimated by kit method using semiautomatic analyzer statfax 3300 .\nthe fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin were estimated to know the diabetic status of the patient .\np : c ratio was calculated by dividing the urinary protein concentration by urinary creatinine concentration .\nstatistical analysis : statistical package for social science ( spss for window version ; spss , 11.5 inc , chicago il ) software was used for statistical analysis .\npearson 's correlation coefficient was used to show the correlation between the spot urine p : c ratio and 24 hours urine total protein .\nsensitivity , specificity , predictive values of random urine p : c ratio at various cut -

clampsia1718 , renal transplantation19 , lupus nephritis20 etc .\nseyed - ali and navin jaipaul21 found that the random urine p : c ratio is a reliable and practical way of estimating and following proteinuria , but its precision and accuracy may be affected by the level of patient physical activity .\njiunn - min wang et al22 concluded that p : c ratio or albumin to creatinine ratio , which was obtained by dipstick , can be used to monitor the potential risk of renal diseases in outpatients , hypertensive and diabetic patients .\nayman m. wohbeh et al23 reported that p : c ratio in spot urine specimens is a more precise , accurate , convenient and reliable method to evaluate proteinuria .\nhowever , only when protein is at reasonably low levels , the p : c ratio is likely to be within acceptable limits . in the present study ,\nthe roc curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.947 indicating that the urinary p : c ratio is sufficiently acceptable to predict significant proteinuria . at the optimal cut - off point of 0.3 ,\nhence , the random p : c ratio is a good predictor of significant proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy . in concordance with our findings , b k yadav et al5 found that area under the roc curve was 0.88 .\nprice et al1 reviewed 16 studies and the area under the curve was in the range of 0.70 to 0.90 , suggesting that the p : c ratio can predict the amount of protein excreted in the urine .\nhence , it is important for each laboratory to determine the cut - off value of p : c ratio which has maximum sensitivity and specificity to be used in those settings .\nthe limitations of the present study were the low sample size , and the difficulties in collection of 24 hours urine sample in the female patients .\n, the present study suggests that a random urine p : c ratio predicts the amount of 24-hour urine protein excretion with high accuracy . this test could be the reasonable alternative to the 24-hour urine sample collection for the detection of significant proteinuria in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients .\nsvk and gsk carried out the design and coordinated the study , participated in most of the experiments and prepared the manuscript .\nsbb and svk provide assistance in the design of the study , coordinated and carried out all the experiments and participated in manuscript preparation ."}

perceptions with 58.7% and lowest in domain of student 's perception of learning with 53.7% .\nwe have a good sample size and overall our sample is representative of the population of duhs .\nthere is no established agreement about the acceptable dreem inventory score from published literature . however , our findings are not very much different from other studies nationally and internationally . a study from private and government medical colleges from pakistan had a mean score of 125/200 , a higher score as compared to this study . studies from bangladesh and srilanka reported a mean dreem score of 110 and 107.4 , respectively . a study from trinidad reported an overall mean score of 109.9 and another from nigeria showed score of 118 . a study from india while comparing first year and clinical batches reported dreem score of 119 and 114 , respectively\nthere are some studies which reported a more positive educational environment mostly after change in curriculum and making some reform .\nfor instance , a study from chile reported a score of 127.5  20.9 ( 63.8% ) after initiation of reform of educational aspects of curriculum .\nthese reforms were emphasized by the wfme and the competencies for the tomorrow 's physicians .\nanother study from uk reported mean dreem score of 139 ( 70% ) after the curriculum was reformed with the recommendations of gmc .\nthis highlights the importance of contemporary student centered curriculum modification and its positive effects on students perception of educational environment . on comparison of the three colleges of duhs , smc students perceived their environment more positively than students of the other two colleges .\nthis indicates that smc students are comparatively more satisfied with what they were experiencing , while students of dmc are more competitive ( higher merit among all three colleges ) and hence more stressed .\nentry in medical colleges through merit produces stress among medical students , right from the beginning .\nthe higher the merit , the more stress . whenever there is stress , people tend to perceive their environment more negatively than when they are relaxed .\nso one reason why dmc students perceive their environment more negatively may be the higher rate of competition faced by them from the very start .\nhowever , students of dimc are mostly from different places of the world and are living away from parents and homes , hence they are more stressed and perceive their environment more negatively compared to smc . in the five domains studied , the lowest score was in student 's perception of learning , which is a point of concern for the faculty and administration .\nthe author believes that educational environment is a new avenue for the university and nobody till now thought about its measurement or its improvement .\nour study will help to gain insight and helps the concerned authorities to work in the right direction making institute a much more productive place for the students .\nthis positivity in females is seen in all studies ( chile , bangladesh , sri lanka ) except india .\nstudents perception of the educational environment have a significant influence on their behavior , motivation , and academic achievement .\nalthough dreem is currently most widely used measure of educational environment , such questionnaires can not show the entire canvas .\nthey may be valuable in indicating the areas of concern by most of the students ; they fail to provide any understanding about the concerned reasons .\nthere is need to have some qualitative data with quantitative inventory as it significantly improves the quantitative inventory understanding , and points out remedies to common areas of student dissatisfaction .\nthe dreem inventory is certainly a useful tool for appraising the educational environment of undergraduate medical institute .\nfirst , the internal consistency of the five sub - scales was quite variable and somewhat low .\nthe same finding was observed in our study where social perception alpha coefficient is 0.38 .\nthese observations should be kept in mind while interpreting the findings of the studies done with this inventory .\ndow university is progressing in very fast pace in terms of quality enhancement and curriculum change in line with current trends in medical education .\nwe believe this will reflect in a positive way about student perception of educational environment as well .\nwe intend to carry out this study again after one year by supplementing with both quantitative and qualitative methods , like whittle et al .\nmean dreem score was 114.4/200 ( 57.2% ) in all three medical colleges affiliated with duhs .\nthe highest score was found in domain of student 's academic self - perceptions and the lowest in domain of student 's perception of learning .\nthe results obtained in this study can be used to direct strategic development and the institutional focus of available resources ."}
{"id": 119, "text": "this study regards itself as a supplement to the common melancholy of failed expectations , contrary effects , unfulfilled promises and the generally deplorable state of affairs lamented in much of the mainstream anthropological and historical literature .\nit aims to achieve a more dynamic perspective by asking when , how and why the initial optimism was fuelled or frustrated in the course of the projects . instead of focusing exclusively on the constructions of the periphery , ie .\nthe african part and its agency , as is the tendency among established african scholars of history and anthropology due to their professional perspective , this paper seeks to explore more of the european activities both within and outside europe . since studies of medical science in european countries after the second world war rarely touch on relations with former colonies\n, there seems to be an imbalance between the number of historical and anthropological studies devoted to the european activities compared to those devoted to the african side in these encounters .\nfurthermore , a renewed examination of the institutions and personnel of the northern hemisphere that dominated the early triumphant histories of colonial medicine and science can shed new light on these : the emphasis on african agency in more recent studies calls for a reversed and complementary perspective focusing on the europeans , who would then have to be seen as being greatly changed in the encounter , often learning as much themselves as they were attempting to teach the africans . thus these two shifts \na  procedural turn from the rather static description of results to the dynamics of transfer and interaction , and a \nrecipients to the modifications of the  donor side  will be some of the primary perspectives of this article .\nthe particular scenario to be examined is that of transfer processes between two countries in western europe and west africa .\nregarding this binational focus , it  is important to note that , unlike most studies on white protagonists in africa after independence , this paper has not chosen a recent european colonial power with many continuing ties to african countries .\na considerable number of academics and academic institutions in the federal republic of germany ( frg ) were among those involved in the re - establishment of a german role in health care in tropical and sub - tropical countries within the new framework of western \ndevelopment aid. ( an eastern european state like the german democratic republic ( gdr ) , by contrast , called its more modest efforts  international solidarity ) . \n  during the first un \ndevelopment was still mainly understood in economic terms , 8% of the west german budget for  technical aid was allotted to the health sector , at a total of 130 million deutschmarks for 176 projects . \n \nafrica became the main regional focus of west german  technical and personnel aid in health , whereas the main focus of aid in the middle east , for example , was vocational training .\nthis was due to a variety of reasons , notably extraordinary local need , the absence of infrastructure necessary for immediate industrialisation , previous colonial , diplomatic , academic and medical relations as well as contemporary power politics .\nthe african recipients included countries north and south of the sahara , with a focus in the 1960s on ethiopia , algeria , senegal , niger and togo . \n \nwest german expert medical academics were involved in most of the major health projects . in view of this , the german \ntogolese relationship in microbiology within the framework of  development aid in the 1960s and 1970s was chosen as an example for closer study .\nthe article will first give a short summary of post - colonial , pre-1945 german academic interest in health outside the north atlantic world , continuing with an overview of west german academic activities in health in non - european countries and of the relationship between the academic world and west german political and administrative structures in \nthe main part of the article will consist of an extensive case study concerning togo .\nthis includes an examination of international co - operation on the part of several institutes at west german universities which did not have a long pre - war tradition of medical research in the tropics : the institute of comparative tropical medicine in the veterinary faculty at munich university , the institutes of hygiene and of parasitology at bonn university and the hygiene institute of wrzburg university .\nthe directors of these institutes responded to the idea that political independence should be followed by scientific independence and they actively supported the creation of a microbiological institute in a sub - saharan state , the institut national dhygine in togo . inevitably , the dynamics of this project were rooted in the earlier background of german academic activities in tropical medicine as well as in later policies for west german \nthus  refraining from the contested issue of the positive or negative impact on the host country s health situation  the second major question to be examined in this study will be the relationship between \nwas it one of mutual benefit and understanding , or did one of the two have to suffer due to pressure from the other s special interests ?\nresources for each other has been explicitly posed and widely discussed with regard to national socialism in germany . \n  a similar question \nalthough with much less emphasis on eventual guilt for crimes and failures  is present in much writing on colonial medicine . \n  a study on the british colonial medical research committee until 1950 , \n  for example , recently addressed this issue for a scenario not unlike this west german case  without exploring moral connotations .\nbeing sceptical towards theoretical monism , the approach chosen here will combine several perspectives from different discourses . in the light of functionalist systems\ntheory , \n  medical academia ( as part of science ) and  development aid ( as part of politics and administration ) will be treated as functional social systems of communications with their own specific objectives , rewards and procedures which render their  coupling potentially difficult .\nbut it is also important to question and deconstruct these notions since neither academia nor \ndevelopment aid in their new african settings were fixed entities in accordance with an official definition but had to be re - invented in the course of their establishment .\nthis looks at  practices such as scientific research and training with their core material means of biological samples , laboratory results and publications on the one hand , ie .\npractices such as planning , agreements , recruiting and practical training on the other hand , ie . the developmental side . as these different functional systems and sets of practices often exist side by side within the same projects , institutions and persons , their interaction can be studied in multiple ways .\napart from the focus on medical research , the additional aims of this article include further investigation of the general relationship between  development ( aid) and health , as this subject has been the focus of increased attention over recent years . \n\n \nas this article focuses on the german side in the encounter , the sources used were from four german archives and from german and international journals only .\nunfortunately , none of the main protagonists mentioned could be interviewed as eyewitnesses as they are already deceased .\nthe academic part of the history is documented in the archives of the university of bonn and the two grant - giving institutions for academic activities , the german research foundation ( dfg ) for research and the german academic exchange service ( daad ) for international co - operation between academic institutions .\nthe governmental contribution , mainly in the form of the then ministry of economic co - operation ( bmz ) , \n  was examined on the basis of documents in the german federal archives ( barch ) .\nit was possible to gain an instructive insight into the different goals , concepts and strategies of these unequal partners by contrasting sources from academia and government . the common temptation to treat the european side in north \nsouth relations as rather monolithic in nature could be countered here by indicating the effects of classic conflicts of interest , especially those between the intellectual , universal and long - term perspective of science and the more practical , national and short - term aims of politics .\nfor several reasons germany occupies a somewhat exceptional place in the history of the interaction between medical academia and health politics at an international level .\ngerman academia achieved scientific prestige in the early years of research in tropical medicine with authorities such as robert koch in berlin or renowned institutions such as the institute for naval and tropical diseases in hamburg , founded in 1900 . \n  but after the first world war , german research was affected by the loss of colonies and by restricted access to tropical territories .\nconsequently , the activities of german experts outside germany consisted of the participation in expeditions and in international commissions of the league of nations . \n  under national socialist rule and during the second world war ,\ntemporary plans to restore a german empire in africa and the military campaigns in north africa and southern europe led to renewed political interest in tropical medicine and hygiene . \n \nparasitology at the university of bonn in a department of the institute of pharmacology in 1943 . \n\n  after the war , the situation was again different from that of the colonial powers of the period .\nthere was no special interest in work on other continents in any of the german research councils , let alone a new colonial research service such as existed in britain . \n \nin tropical agricultural research , the purpose of the discipline was quickly shifted from supporting german settlers and those of other nationalities to \ndevelopment aid. \n  in medicine , decolonisation provided new opportunities for academic specialists dependent on contact with tropical regions , notably parasitologists or bacteriological experts on cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases .\nin addition , the decline of smallpox , tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in germany freed up capacity for the support of anti - infectious hygiene and vaccination initiatives outside europe .\nwest germany thus regained the necessary preconditions for a role in international medicine and health , ie . a sufficient supply of well - qualified scientists and the renewal of economic and diplomatic influence that had been lost after the first world war .\nmedical scientists now readily seized the opportunities offered by the bilateral  technical assistance for under - developed countries ( technische hilfe fr unterentwickelte lnder ) started by west germany in 1956 . thus the complex relationship between academia and  development aid ( as parts of the differing social systems of science and politics ) began in the context of cold war .\ndevelopment aid when the first west german university institutes and hospitals started their engagement in asia , africa and latin america in the early 1960s .\ngovernment funds for health had first been used to support the german christian medical missions , which continued and even increased their pre - war programmes of sending health workers , equipment and material overseas and of training local health staff .\nthe first so - called entwicklungshelfer [ development aid workers ] of the new deutscher entwicklungsdienst ( ded ) [ german development service , a volunteer service for professional staff modelled on the us peace corps , did not leave germany until 1964 . in the period up to october 1965 ,\njust ten of these members of staff  fewer than five per cent  held a university degree .\nthis prompted ded managers to think about job opportunities for university graduates at universities in \ndeveloping countries. \n  another agency of the west german government in charge of development issues , the gawi ( garantieabwicklungsgesellschaft ) , also sent some medical specialists . \n \nrequested by friendly governments , they worked in major hospitals , mainly in ethiopia , algeria and togo .\nmeanwhile , several hundred other german physicians had continued to work in government health facilities in decolonised countries , especially in the middle east and in south - east asia without their work being organised or supported by west german government agencies . \n\n  in the 1960s ,\napplication ,  non - attachment and  project. these principles meant that aid would only be granted at the explicit request of the national government in the form of a project proposal , that financial aid would not commit recipients to buy the required equipment in germany and that the aid was tied to the agreed projects and could not consist of grants to the general budget or of the mere delivery of goods . \n \nwhile these principles were often handled in a rather cavalier manner in practice , they did nevertheless establish the basis required for scientific and medical co - operation : new hospitals or institutes were not offered , but had to be requested by the governments of the partner countries ; the means granted were bound to these institutions and could not be used for other health care or research purposes ; and the construction , equipment and supply was not necessarily commissioned with german companies .\nalthough the west german government also financed multilateral organizations such as the who , it systemically prioritised aid to individual states , as this offered better opportunities for pursuing its interests in foreign politics .\nthe west german report for the development assistance committee ( dac ) of the organization for economic co - operation and development ( oecd ) of 1962 stated bluntly that  the federal government prefers bilateral assistance. \n  within health , it especially supported medical education , training and research . typically , health projects for research and practice were negotiated and operated between two governments , with an international agency fulfilling an advisory function .\nfollowing the wishes of its member states , the who itself had to refrain from establishing its own research institutes .\ninstead , it worked with  collaborating centres in several member countries and received support from its technical departments in geneva as a kind of substitute for proper research institutes of its own .\nrestriction on multilateral activities remained a feature of german development aid beyond political parties and coalitions . in the 1970s ,\nthe west german preference for unilaterally sending experts and development workers even increased dramatically when erhard eppler , the minister responsible for development co - operation , and chancellor willy brandt demanded a doubling of their numbers within five years . \n  despite opposition from the ministries of health and foreign affairs , the ministry of development co - operation , which had been created for managing \ndevelopment aid in 1961 , was finally given responsibility for all projects of  technical assistance in 1965 . \n \nit relied on the gawi , later renamed the gtz , \n  for the planning and implementation of the projects .\ntechnical assistance was even more unclear , however , since this also touched on responsibilities which were located within yet another area .\nthis was the area of the federal ministry of education and science ( bmbw ) founded in 1969 , which in turn sponsored two further agencies , the daad and dfg . \n \nthus various different parties were involved : not only the donor and recipient countries as such , but also various public donors in germany and various recipients  the project partners in germany and in the foreign country .\nthe situation was highly complex , mirroring german federalism and thereby fundamentally differing from the centralism of france and britain , where the  pasteurians and orstom ( office de la recherche scientifique et technique outre mer ) or the medical research council respectively controlled overseas microbiological work in terms of staffing , funding and research direction . \n\n \nuniversities had to find their position within this particular and rather complicated framework of west german  development aid and research funding . at the time ,\ncurative medicine in rural hospitals in africa and south or south - east asia had been left to the german christian missions .\nthe fields of hygiene and public health were regarded by experts as most important for solving the health problems of  developing countries. hygiene institutes \nin addition to medical education and teaching hospitals  therefore became a major focus of early west german \ndevelopment aid. there are several examples of this kind of co - operation with areas of focus quite characteristic of the respective countries . in kabul ,\nprofessor fritz fhner of the hygiene institute of hamburg first oversaw the establishment of a hygiene institute at the university from 1960 to 1963 and , from 1964 onwards , the creation of a similar service at national level .\nfor this purpose , he headed a team of ten german expatriates who were responsible for virology , clinical chemistry and haematology as well as for the inspection of food , water and drugs .\nthe microbiology , health education and epidemiology units , on the other hand , were organised by the who . \n \nin bangkok , the public health research institute received its equipment from the frg and had four west german staff members in 1969 . \n \nthe hamburg institute for naval and tropical diseases , when asked for advice on laboratory equipment , established a programme of co - operation with the tropical institute at the university of lima in the early 1960s . \n \nthe hamburg institute also founded a research centre in bong mine , liberia in 1968 .\nan example of early academic co - operation well known to the west german public due to its tragic ending was a project by the medical faculty of freiburg university , which created a medical school in hu , the ancient imperial city of vietnam , in 1961 . \n \nit was devoted to medical education only and succeeded in qualifying its first medical doctors before the project was discontinued due to the murder of three german physicians and the head of mission s wife by the  vietcong in 1968 .\nhowever , such co - operation was also often affected by side - effects of the cold war , as in the case of the theodor bilharz institute in egypt funded by the frg . here ,\nconstruction was delayed , though not completely interrupted , for several years following the suspension of diplomatic relations between egypt and the frg from 1965 to 1972 , which had occurred as a result of the state visit of the east german head of state walter ulbricht to cairo . \n\n \nin overall terms it can be said that several west german institutes and medical scientists had already received government or other public support to develop health - related academic infrastructure in african , asian and latin american countries before joint scientific research was explicitly included in \ndevelopment aid. it was only in the late 1960s that germany publicly looked at british practice as a possible role model for international co - operation between universities , extending an invitation to professor c.  t.  ingold , vice - chair of the london - based inter - university council for higher education overseas \n  to speak in germany .\ningold , who was a renowned mycologist himself ( and father of the later famous anthropologist tim ingold ) , presented british policies and experiences to a german audience in 1969 and emphasised the need for political independence on both sides as well as flexibility and the avoidance of paternalistic \nneocolonialism. two years later , in 1971 , co - operation in science and higher education became an official part of west german \none of the earlier , in many ways pioneering , projects linking the german government focus on public health to german academia was already in place in the small west african state of togo .\ngerman medical relations with togo had already had a long tradition before the country became independent of france in 1960 .\nhaving previously been part of the west african region known as the  slave coast and of the portuguese trade network , the territory of the present republic of togo and of the upper volta region of ghana was proclaimed as the german  protectorate of togo in 1884 by a medical doctor , gustav nachtigal ( 183485 ) , who was then also german consul in tunis and german imperial commissioner for west africa . \n \nbeing a so - called  model colony ( musterkolonie ) , togo experienced various german activities in the fields of health care and medical research , \n  amongst them the first german government hospital in tropical africa . \n \ninternationally famous german doctors like the  discoverer of the smallpox virus , the pathologist enrique paschen ( 18601936 ; in togo 191112 ) , and the hygienist ernst rodenwaldt ( 18781965 ; in togo 190913 ) worked in the colony before it came under french and british control during the first world war . \n  the official division into british togoland and french togoland as a league of nations mandate in 1922 finally led to the present situation , the british part being incorporated into the gold coast , later ghana , and the french part retaining the name and forming the republic of togo .\nalthough france had also introduced its common west african health system here , french togoland had not received institutions for the higher education of health professionals or for medical research in the same way as other french territories in west africa such as senegal , cameroon , congo - brazzaville or the central african republic . immediately after independence in 1960 ,\nthe new republic of togo and the frg signed a bilateral agreement , which also included health . \n \nthe first prime minister and subsequent president of togo , sylvio olympio ( 190263 ) , was especially interested in these relations with the first colonial power . \n \nhis cousin pedro olympio ( 18981969 ) , after education at secondary schools in the netherlands and germany run by a german missionary society , had studied medicine at the universities of bonn and munich and had worked temporarily at the hamburg institute for naval and tropical diseases before undertaking further studies in paris and returning to his native country as the first togolese physician educated and trained in europe . \n \nit seems to have been this special interest in germany which led to the official agreement on technical co - operation , including first ideas for a national institute of hygiene , more than a year before west germany even had a ministry responsible for development co - operation .\ngiven the early contacts in the area of hygiene , the government of togo requested west german assistance in this particular field  while ignoring conflicts and repression the german colonial administration had caused , especially in the field of public health . \n \nthe absence of an institut pasteur , however , was probably a more important actual reason than mere colonial nostalgia or anti - french sentiment .\nthe co - operation between the federal government and medical academia in germany which became necessary for the agreed german intervention in the field of hygiene in togo was facilitated by the contacts of professor dr  med . \nhorst habs ( 190287 ) , who had been director of the hygiene institute at the university of bonn since 1958 . at that time , this city was the provisional capital of the frg as well as the seat of the west german parliament , government and ministries .\nhabs had a long record in politics related to medicine and academia . during national socialism ,\nhe had been a member of the nsdap , of the national socialist association for physicians ( ns - rztebund ) and of the national socialist association for lecturers ( ns - dozentenbund ) , and he had also been an officer in the ss . \n \nhe had taken part in a confidential meeting in 1943 , which  among other topics  discussed inhumane experiments concerning sulfonamide and typhus on inmates of german concentration camps .\nafter the war , he advised the new west german army ( bundeswehr ) on ways to ( re-)establish its medical service . \n\n  in 1960 ,\nheinz peter rudolf seeliger ( 192097 ) , was commissioned with a consultancy on the health situation in togo .\nstrangely enough  an initiative by the west german ministry of the interior , where a \nhealth department was in charge of all medical and health affairs before the creation of a ministry of health in 1961 . \n \ndue to his previous work in the laboratory of the us forces in heidelberg , seeliger was far more internationally informed and minded than most of his german colleagues , although he had not worked outside the western world at that point . \n \nseeliger visited togo for two months in 1961 and wrote a survey in close collaboration with international agencies such as the who .\nformulated in both a german and french version , this then served as the basis for planning the agreed institute of hygiene . \n  in a later publication on the trip\n, seeliger described the togolese expectations of germany as  an often touching affection towards the former protective power in the hope of  a decisive contribution to building the young state. \n  when the official additional bilateral agreement on the establishment of an institute of hygiene in lom was signed on 31 may 1965 , construction of the institute building had already been underway for a year . completed in 1967 ,\nthe republic of togo provided the construction site , locally produced furniture , tax exemption for the import of necessary materials from abroad , transport and storage within the country , and various kinds of support for the accommodation of the german staff . upon completion of the building , seeliger , then director of the institute for hygiene and microbiology at wrzburg university since 1965 and thereafter consultant to the gawi , referred once again to the colonial legacy : \n on the whole , it should be noted that the building now makes an excellent impression .\n(  ) simple and functional and like a typical purpose - built structure , it fits beautifully into the government quarters of the capital of lom .\n(  ) nevertheless , compared to the french institutes in abidjan and dakar , visited by the undersigned , the interior looks rather modest .\nhowever , it thereby achieves the required degree of frugality , while retaining a certain class .\nthis state of affairs should be especially emphasised when informing the german public , as is desirable . \n\n\n  on the whole\n(  ) simple and functional and like a typical purpose - built structure , it fits beautifully into the government quarters of the capital of lom .\n(  ) nevertheless , compared to the french institutes in abidjan and dakar , visited by the undersigned , the interior looks rather modest .\nhowever , it thereby achieves the required degree of frugality , while retaining a certain class .\nthis state of affairs should be especially emphasised when informing the german public , as is desirable . \n\n \nsuch remarks reveal a search for the right balance between self - confidence and modesty when approaching the new tasks , especially in comparison with well - established previous colonial nations .\nthe operation of the institute was regulated in an additional agreement in 1967 , granting german financial support for four years and german staff for three years . running\nthe institute was a joint german  togolese enterprise and obviously functioned smoothly , apart from very rare german complaints such as in 1969 :  despite all the goodwill ,\nthe togolese have difficulties to provide their contributions. \n  the first german team , all of whom had previous ties to the institute of hygiene at bonn university , consisted of two doctors  the project leader and head of the department of applied hygiene , and the head of the department of parasitology  as well as two medico - technical assistants , a mechanic and an electro - technician ; a typist was later added . upon its opening in 1967 ,\n mentoring by german university institutes or faculties of their counterparts in developing countries had already been recommended by a german expert meeting on  experiences in establishing health care in developing countries in 1962 , where seeliger had been one of the few university - affiliated participants . \n \nhabs also became involved in efforts to control disease in togo by organising a polio immunisation programme , together with his wife , and \noutside africa  in efforts to eradicate malaria in greece . \n  among the german mentors ,\nhe had been director of the bavarian state institute for vaccination , including an institute for infectious and tropical medicine , since 1948 , and had held the chair for comparative tropical medicine in the faculty of veterinary medicine at the university of munich since 1964 . \n \nherrlich had spent most of his time from 1933 to 1939 in east africa , afghanistan and india , studying the genealogy of wheat in the hindukush region in 1935 and visiting most countries of eastern and southern africa between 1936 and 1937 . \n \nafter 1950 , he devoted several trips to the study of acute problems of tropical medicine , eg . investigating a smallpox epidemic in india in 1958 . \n \nherrlich s participation in mentoring the lom institute is remarkable , since he had , in 1963 , been an outspoken opponent of the establishment of permanent outposts of european institutes of tropical medicine in former colonial territories .\nhe had considered these places as mainly suitable for training academic novices and not for long - term research . \n  the high costs and the narrow focus on a single region instead of the broader information to be gained by expeditions had been his main arguments against fixed research facilities ; instead , he had proposed commissioning research to varying regions and for limited periods .\nafter herrlich s death in 1970 , the parasitologist professor dr gerhard piekarski ( 191092 ) from bonn university replaced him as mentor . \n\n  in september 1969 ,\nthe inter - ministerial committee of the west german government responsible for the project prolonged it for another two years and increased the expatriate staff .\nthe hygienist , who was still also the project leader , and the parasitologist were supplemented by a bacteriologist while the number of medico - technical assistants was increased from two to four . a laboratory assistant for animals\nafter these two years , the co - operation was formalised in an additional treaty of 15 september 1971 . as early as 1968\nthe west german ministry of economic co - operation had praised the institute in almost lyrical terms : \n the institute of hygiene as the centre of public hygiene excels by its enormous impact [  ausstrahlungskraft ] .\nit is one of the most important projects of german technical aid in togo , which essentially functions in education and training beyond its diagnostic tasks . \n\n\n \nthe institute of hygiene as the centre of public hygiene excels by its enormous impact [  ausstrahlungskraft ] .\nit is one of the most important projects of german technical aid in togo , which essentially functions in education and training beyond its diagnostic tasks . \n\n \nits actual functioning in these different areas , however , needs to be looked at in more detail since the whole project was still far ahead of the general development of medical infrastructure in togo . in his report of 1973 , dr  med . \npeter scheiber , project leader since 1969 , criticised the fact that , at the time of the establishment of the institute ,  the place and the tasks for a central laboratory with the range of duties described were neither prepared nor even projected (  ) in the public health system of togo. \n  only after 1970 did conditions regarding the supply of water and power , roads and  self - confidence improve . nevertheless , in the report which they published in the journal of the german medical association , scheiber and his predecessor dr  med . \ngeorg quincke , later a staff member of the who from 1969 onwards and finally its director of the division of food and nutrition , described the start as being marked by a rapid increase in the number of samples and smooth collaboration with national authorities and international agencies such as the who . \n \nthe same was said about the immunisations organised by the institute between 1967 and 1969 . according to habs , the provision of such vaccines and the less frequently needed anti - sera made  the pioneering function of an institute for the future organization of the health system especially visible . \n \nthe national institute seems to have worked well from the very beginning as a laboratory , vaccination service and advisory body . with regard to the long - term perspective\nseen in the categories of german governmental budgets and public funds , the project remained one of  technical aid rather than \nfinancial aid. its main aim was thus specific capacity - building rather than the production of scientific knowledge or an increase in the financial resources available for health care and research .\nco - operating german academics were well aware of this task :  it can not be overemphasised that there is long - term educational work ahead of us which concerns all kinds of staff at the institute. \n\n  the initial togolese staff consisted of an administrator , two medico - technical assistants  trained in germany , but still inexperienced , three workers for the garden , stables and cleaning , a driver , a servant for the scullery and a porter . \n \na co - director and an administrator from togo assisted the german academics in their organisational and bureaucratic tasks .\nperhaps it was also this model of prolonged joint work that contributed to the prevention of struggles for power in the transition period .\nsuch conflicts had occurred at the pasteur institute of cameroon in the same year of 1967 , where a parting french director and his colleagues blocked an african successor who was just returning from france . \n\n  concerning the main , capacity - building task , seeliger had to disappoint expectations : \n employing togolese counterparts ( homologues ) who can take over duties as collaborators of the heads of department can not be expected in the near future , as only a few togolese medical students have returned home after completing their education , and they were immediately charged with medical care . \n\n\n  employing togolese counterparts ( homologues ) who can take over duties as collaborators of the heads of department can not be expected in the near future , as only a few togolese medical students have returned home after completing their education , and they were immediately charged with medical care . \n\n  between 1965 and 1970 ,\nuniversity education for citizens of togo was mainly provided at the institut suprieur du benin . \n  again in 1969 , a note in the german records referred to the  seemingly hopeless counterpart situation due to the medical students lack of interest in these jobs . \n \nas late as 1972 , the german project leaders still complained about the lack of togolese academic staff , as there were hardly any  candidates that were interested in questions of theoretical medicine  although the number of togolese doctors in the country had nearly doubled since the start of the project . \n\n \nan improvement could be hoped for from the most important togolese development for the academic side of the project , ie .\nthe foundation of a university at lom in 1970 , which included a medical school .\nthe academic staff of the institute provided practical instruction at the school in co - operation with the hospitals of ophthalmology and gynaecology / obstetrics and also offered scientific training for possible future researchers . as early as 1961 , prior to the german \ntogolese co - operation via the hygiene institute , german technical aid had supported the hospital in tokoin , a suburb of lom .\nfive german doctors and two medico - technical assistants were employed there in 1971 , when the hospital was becoming the clinical part of the new university s medical school .\nfurther assistance through mentoring ( patenschaft ) by german universities was explicitly requested from the togolese side . \n \ninter - university co - operation seemed to be regarded as a successful model for capacity building .\nthe  capacity - building activities of the institute also went beyond its own needs and medical academia . besides training on the job for the togolese academic staff of the institute and the contribution to medical education at the university , the institute organised special courses for laboratory assistants , hygiene assistants in the public health service and who fellows . \n\n\nthe question as to whether and to what extent research was to be part of the institute s activities was far less clearly regulated than might be expected of plans involving german university professors .\nafter all , they had been brought up in the humboldtian tradition of a unity of teaching and research , complemented in the medical faculty by practical health care via clinical work and public health .\nin contrast to other institutes of medical schools or to medical institutes outside universities , institutes of hygiene had always been characterised by their combination of research and public health , ie . their dual function for science and for current medico - political or administrative purposes . in the nineteenth century\n, they had often been established as laboratories by local authorities and had only later been incorporated into universities , as occurred in bonn about 1900 . \n \nor they remained independent of a university despite their strong research activities , as in the case of hamburg , which was for a time the largest institute of hygiene in germany .\nthus german academic hygienists were well acquainted with the hybrid position between laboratory research and routine work , between the production of new scientific knowledge and serving the country , eg . in vaccination and epidemiological surveillance .\nit remained unclear as to how far this double function was now also intended for the national institute in lom .\nthe chances for the two fields were judged quite differently . in his expert opinion on the institute of 1967 ,\nseeliger stated bluntly :  a research activity of its own can not be considered , things given as they are , since for this activity there were other \nexisting opportunities in lom. \n  obviously , research was not even planned in the official description of the tasks of the institute , revealing a slight difference of views between the german development aid agencies and german academia .\nthis tension becomes visible in publications too , sometimes even occurring within the same article , as in the above - mentioned 1972 journal of the german medical association . here ,\ndiverging lists regarding the duties of the institute can be found in the information box on the one hand , which is obviously based on official sources , and in the report by the two german scientists on the other hand .\nthe box only speaks of the institute s function  as a reference laboratory for samples sent in , as a central  health office  of the republic and as a central institution for a system of outposts under construction , by which a network of the health system shall cover the whole country. \n  the authors , however , risked minor contradictions when they wrote that the institute  took over the tasks of a laboratory for the public health service and , as such , shall perform examinations as well as research work in the field of public health [ volksgesundheit]. furthermore they stated that these tasks equalled those of  a public health office [ medizinalbro ] for examination , responsible for the whole of togo , which has an advisory function in the control of diseases and delivers the necessary documents for this purpose. \n  solely a  public health office or also responsible for  research work , what were the major tasks ?\nthe scientists explicitly emphasised research work as an equal task , whereas the institute s only official function in the view of the german donor , ie .\ndevelopment aid and the republic of togo was public health . as far as can be surmised from the sources , this diversity of aims did not hinder the work of the institute , perhaps even resulting in the contrary .\nthe backbone provided by the german contribution was the fact that staff stayed for at least a year , the minimum requirement suggested by wilhelm schulze , an army hygienist , bacteriologist and specialist for tropical medicine at the institute in 1969 .\nphysical fitness ,  self - initiative and independence in working and identifying problems , and  the readiness to establish contacts. \n  mentor habs appealed to the german public health service to supply experts of this kind by dispatching them to  development aid missions and reintegrating them afterwards ,  which would make a career in the public health service more attractive for some doctors. \n  but the opportunity to do research also attracted promising junior scientists to the institute . among these were the later directors of the hygiene institutes in hamburg and stuttgart , jochen bockemhl and gerhard schrter respectively , who probably would not have come as ordinary  development aid workers. coming for research , they brought their scientific expertise to the institute with its increasingly togolese academic staff .\nproject assistants had already been provided for in article 4 of the additional treaty of 1965 . \n \nthe mentoring senior scientists , all of them holders of university chairs or directors of institutes , were certainly more prepared to take on co - responsibility for the institute because it promised additional research opportunities .\nthis was especially true of a parasitologist such as piekarsky , who only had very minor public health tasks at home in germany and was therefore much more of a pure academic than a practitioner of hygiene .\nnevertheless , the academic merits garnered by research remained almost completely on the german side , even when the scientific publications were in languages other than german , including french as the official language of togo . \n  to date\n, it has only been possible to identify three articles by the german researchers where a co - author has an obviously african surname .\none of these two co - authors , a.  amdom , was not even a staff member at the institute , but was instead in the service des contagieux , centre hospitalier universitaire , lom ( togo ) , and had already published in france and africa several times previously , once even on the issue of cholera under investigation in the article . \n  the other author , k.  n.  agbo , belonged to the academic staff of the national institute , as medcin - chef of the parasitology section . \n \nthe article in question was the first and only authorship for nearly a decade under the name of k.  agbo in an internationally listed medical journal .\nthe next occurrence was in 1984 , when a k.  agbo , technicien suprieur at the laboratory and parasitological services of the university hospital lom , started a long list of publications on parasitological issues with francophone and anglophone research partners .\nperhaps k.  n.  agbo s early co - authorship was also facilitated by his newly arrived european co - authors : the german reny anneliese braun - munzinger ( 194890 ) , who was accustomed to the co - operative practice of local co - authorship through her previous work with indian researchers in india , and the british scientist brian a. southgate ( 19302011 ) , who became well known for his support of non - european researchers and who obviously saw this practice as an international standard . \n  yet on the whole , junior african researchers with an initial scientific training at the national institute could not further their potential academic careers by means of publications arising from the research activities of the german scientists .\nmost probably , the initiative , the design of the studies and the writing of the manuscripts are mirrored in this result : that almost exclusively germans appear as authors . even in the archival documents and apart from the occasional acknowledgement of  technical assistance in the publications , it usually remains unclear as to how far the togolese counterparts were actually involved in , eg .\nthere is just one very elaborate acknowledgment from 1976 and 1977 by bockemhl in the context of his research on salmonella and shigella , conducted between 1971 and 1973 : \n the examinations reported in this paper have been performed under somewhat difficult field conditions and were only possible thanks to the sympathy and collaboration of the local authorities : the regional representatives of the government , health officers , nurses , sanitary inspectors , school teachers , and village headmen.special thanks are due to my team , who worked together for 16 months : mr  v.  kpelevi , mr  l.  lawson , mr  l.  pr . \nagbodjan , mr  r.  apedoh , and mr  m.  sessou.serotyping of strains was performed at the institute of hygiene and microbiology , university of wrzburg , by mrs  r.  miethke , mrs  d.  legat , miss  i.  voigt , and the national reference centre for salmonella , hamburg , by priv .- doz . [\nthe examinations reported in this paper have been performed under somewhat difficult field conditions and were only possible thanks to the sympathy and collaboration of the local authorities : the regional representatives of the government , health officers , nurses , sanitary inspectors , school teachers , and village headmen .\nspecial thanks are due to my team , who worked together for 16 months : mr  v.  kpelevi , mr  l.  lawson , mr  l.  pr . \nserotyping of strains was performed at the institute of hygiene and microbiology , university of wrzburg , by mrs  r.  miethke , mrs  d.  legat , miss  i.  voigt , and the national reference centre for salmonella , hamburg , by priv .- doz .\nthe three female german collaborators without a doctoral degree were probably medico - technical assistants and had been co - authors in two previous publications . \n  the names of the african collaborators were not mentioned again in the second part of the publication and never recurred as authors of articles in international medical journals . \n  thus , even when a german scientist clearly wanted to acknowledge the essential work of african staff members , german academic conventions seemed to exclude their function as co - authors .\nthis story of academic publishing serves as a further telling example of how  medico - scientific practices may crystallise post - colonial obscenity , by defining , incorporating , and exploiting socio - racial inequities , \n  as formulated concisely by the french historian guillaume lachenal .\nthe final plan had been that the institute could be handed over to the authorities of togo in early 1976 after a year under the responsibility of a togolese director advised by his german predecessor . \n \nthus the whole project , from the start to the transition , was intended to last less than ten years , a goal which was , in fact , ultimately achieved .\nwhen the institute was handed over to the togolese ministry of health and social services on 9 january 1976 , the high esteem for the institute from both sides was indicated by the presence of several togolese ministers and several german representatives , including the two mentors seeliger and piekarski . \n \nthere was no evidence of conflicts during the transition of power such as those which again paralysed the previously mentioned institut pasteur in cameroon between 1974 and 1980 . \n\n \nconsidering contemporary german journalism s widespread criticism of german development aid or emergency aid in other places and its particular , politically motivated attention to german relations with the dictatorial ruler eyadma ( president , 19672005 ) , it should be mentioned that the hygiene institute in lom remained without unfavourable media coverage in germany .\nthe institute had been requested by a still legitimate government and was clearly in the interests of the whole country ; it was in line with the german shift towards preventative medicine and academic research in development co - operation ; its construction was not delayed in any notable way ; collaboration occurred without major conflicts ; and the aim of  capacity - building by training counterparts was achieved in so far as togolese heads of departments were able to take over the responsibilities in routine work at the end of the project .\nthe institute was not a foreign body , but formed part of the national health system .\nin fact , the institutes in lom and bangkok were the only two positive exceptions explicitly mentioned in an otherwise devastating evaluation of health projects by a senior official in the german ministry of economic co - operation in 1968 , their success being particularly attributed to continuous mentorship leading to new forms of partnership . \n\n  beyond the routine work of the institute , togo profited from at least some of the data gathered by german scientists during research .\nthe studies  mostly supported by the dfg  were largely epidemiological , primarily giving information on the health situation in the country concerning the frequency of certain germs and , to a lesser degree , contributing to universal medical knowledge such as bacteriological taxonomy .\nresearch especially concerned common bacterial diseases such as cholera \n  and salmonellosis , \n  as well as shigellosis \n  and gonorrhoea . \n \nthe academic publications were often a side - effect of routine activities at the national institute such as health examinations of  prostitutes and hygiene checks of schools , wells and food .\nemphasis was placed on the  importance of unbiased , critical parasitological examinations , as opposed to simple routine diagnostics for expected findings . only in this way\nwas it possible to establish the presence of certain worm eggs which had not previously been described for west africa or to identify a cholera - like epidemic due to vibrio parahaemolyticus . \n\n \nthe parasitologist piekarski did not publish any research work himself on the health situation in togo .\nbut the institute s research interest was extended from bacteriology to parasitological diseases , such as bancroftian filariasis , \n  onchocercosis , \n  malaria , bilharzia and sleeping sickness , \n  during the his post-1970 mentoring period and even for many years after the completion of the development project in 1976 .\nreny braun - munzinger s joining of the national institute gave it an expatriate medico - technical assistant who had previously worked at the university of heidelberg and would do so again after her time in togo .\nshe thus broadened the institute s scientific connections beyond the initial mentoring universities of bonn , wrzburg and munich . in these studies towards the end of the project , acknowledgement is made of financial support other than that provided by the dfg with its exclusive responsibility for research , eg .\n by the ministry of public health and social affairs , togo and by the agency for technical co - operation ( gtz ) , eschborn , federal republic of germany. \n  this indicates a full integration of scientific research into the development project and the national health system .\nmeanwhile , however , ideas on scientific relations were changing in germany . in 1971 , the professor of economics peter meyer - dohm ( * 1930 ) , who was later head of bochum university ( 19759 ) , demanded that the common  transfer of knowledge must be supplemented or even replaced by independent \nacademic colonialism. \n  scientists of the  developing country should have their share in the research work and its results . \n  as noted above\nseveral factors stood in the way of achieving more than training for the routine tasks of a central national laboratory : less than a decade was probably far too short ; the mentor herrlich had doubted the chances of fruitful research work in a permanent place in the tropics anyway ; the project leaders hinted at the difficulties of keeping up the standards to which they were accustomed at home under these conditions ; \n  researchers preferred serological testing at home in germany to the difficulties and expenses involved in establishing further bacteriological methods in togo ; \n  and  probably most important  togolese staff with academic qualifications were scarce and were already overburdened with routine tasks .\nobviously , the project was ill - suited for capacity - building in scientific research .\nthis would have demanded far more commitment from all sides and perhaps also conditions within the country that would not be achieved for quite some time . a further task and development project which was started two years after the completion of the original development project brought increased importance to research at the institute . in 1978 ,\nthe gtz \n  supported the establishment of an onchocerciasis reference laboratory to be directed by the parasitologist hartwig schulz - key from the hamburg institute for naval and tropical diseases .\nschulz - key retained this responsibility even after moving from hamburg to the university of tuebingen .\nhowever , the site for future research was moved from the capital to the regional hospital of sokod , the centre of onchocerciasis control .\nthe institute s research centre flourished within this large project , which had already been started by the who in 1974 and received support from the world bank and the european economic community ( later european union ) , among others , offering research opportunities in a tropical place over the years to more than a hundred , mostly german , junior scientists in the fields of medicine and biology \n  until the present day . following the loss of these research opportunities to the regional hospital of sokod , the institute in lom also had to give up the name it had adopted in 1967 to honour its german donor and early german work in togo .\nwhen the west german army decided to remove the name of ernst rodenwaldt , incidentally one of piekarski s early mentors in the late 1930s , \n  from the name of an institute in koblenz in germany in march 1998 , after his connivance with inhumane human experimentation during national socialism had become widely known , the togolese authorities followed suit in october of the same year .\nthe close relations between germany and togo thus even influenced issues not related to the african continent and development co - operation .\nthe two major research questions  the relationship between west germany and togo and between medical academia and  development aid  have been answered to quite different extents due to the respective content of the german sources .\nthe eurocentric reports and correspondence reveal more about the interaction between development politics and biomedical science than that between the germans and togolese .\nthe political administration invited academia to play a role in what were both old and new fields .\nthere appeared to be a necessary connection between the  progress and  modernity that  development aid claimed to bring and the promises of science  despite the obvious fact that the first was directed towards what were regarded as the most backward regions and the latter strived to be at the most advanced edge of human progress .\nunequal partners had to negotiate their terms and seem to have done so to a certain degree of satisfaction on both sides . however , the area of expertise for which university members were sought remained limited in the west german scenario during the first two decades of development co - operation .\nwhile non - medical academic experts in britain such as health economists richard titmuss and brian abel - smith were also commissioned with recommendations on comprehensive health care services in countries of the global south , west german professors were asked only for infectious disease control and clinical work .\nthis mirrors two characteristics of germany : its previous pivotal role in hygiene and bacteriology ( which , of course , equally holds for british and french institutions on tropical health ) and its lack of a continuous and recent colonial experience in medical administration . in view of the interwar german approach of social hygiene , a move towards social medicine as known from late british colonial policy\nthe case studied here is thus typical of west germany of the period , since academic expertise was not expected for health care in general .\nmedical academics were expected to contribute only to medical education and to establishing institutes on viral , bacterial and parasitological diseases or general hygiene , including toxicology , while returning german doctors were invited to contribute their expertise on the practical level of health care only . \n\n \nthe first task of academics was consultancy to the west german government , since the government agencies for  technical aid did not yet have relevant experts of their own in these early years and benefited from temporarily hiring academics from university institutes without having to offer permanent jobs in germany .\nthus these experts travelled to the tropics in order to identify health problems that would need special academic expertise in the relevant country .\na decade later , by 1973 , the west german press maintained that the  method practised by the ministry of economic co - operation in sending ad hoc consultants , usually travel - happy university professors , on exploratory trips for a week has proved to be a failure since  permanent qualified observation and administrative support on the spot was lacking. \n  however , this accusation  typical of the increasingly sceptical attitude of the early 1970s towards development aid\neven before the professors visited the country , the host country had expressed the desire for the institute , and its establishment was principally agreed between the governments .\nthe diseases to be addressed , the methods required , and the staff and equipment needed . as togo did not have any specialists in these fields ,\nthe project itself was mainly based in this case on the plan drawn up by the german academic who first visited the country .\nafter the planning and construction of the institute , the next task for the universities was the provision of both technical and academic german staff .\nthis was a further advantage for the federal ministries , which thereby gained privileged access to suitable staff .\nbut the german institutes also profited from being able to offer what were often well - paid and attractive jobs as well as research opportunities to their post - doctoral members . here\n, two different groups of biomedical experts emerged , reflecting the continuing tension between science and the health services , or academia and development co - operation : the doctors who held jobs at the institutes in africa for a year or more did not usually pursue academic careers later , but rather stayed in international or development organisations , whereas those who stayed in africa for research projects only became professors or directors afterwards for the most part .\nthus the increasing west german split between academic experts on communicable diseases at universities and other research institutes on the one hand and public health officers in the civil service on the other was also made manifest in international co - operation . in togo ,\nthe main task , so - called  capacity - building , was fulfilled for routine activities through collaboration between the german and togolese counterparts .\nperiods spent in europe by togolese students , mainly as part of their doctoral studies , seem to have been a precondition for acquiring the skills necessary to carry out research independently .\nlong - standing co - operation which continued after the end of the development project was the decisive condition for building up research capacities .\nprofessor fhner , head of the similar project in kabul mentioned above , had demanded three phases , each of about three years : ( 1 )  establishing routine work , ( 2 )  sending the counterparts to germany for further training , and ( 3 )  transferring responsibility for research to them by reducing german staff . \n \ndevelopment decade , beginning in 1990 , development projects usually envisaged a short timeline that was not suitable for developing research capacities .\nhyperoptimism of development workers regarding the feasibility of transferring the knowledge , skills and necessary approaches within , eg .\na two - year stay , seemed to be especially ill suited to the long formation period of researchers . \n \nits common timescale of decades instead of years , its post - graduate training or research in german institutions and its mutual visits financed by funding agencies for research and higher learning enabled it to follow and complement the initial \ndevelopment project. while the story documented in this paper ends in that decade , academic relations between ( west ) germany and  developing countries , especially in africa , continued .\nthey will therefore be the subject of the following short overview , which introduces further comparisons and aspects .\nsince the 1970s , these relations received regular attention and financial support in both the academic and development sectors . \n \nthe institute for tropical hygiene and public health at heidelberg university became a centre for north  south co - operation for more than just infectious diseases , as its major topics included midwifery and nutrition , the latter also being found at the university of giessen .\nresearch on tropical medicine in tropical countries gained new momentum even beyond governmental interests . in 1981 , the hamburg institute of naval and tropical diseases opened a research laboratory in lambarene , gabon , the former place of work of the famous doctor albert schweitzer .\nthis was done without german public funding and was entirely based on private donations . \n  on the whole , links between development co - operation and academia decreased despite , or perhaps because of , special funding that the dfg and the daad started by programmes for academic co - operation with  developing countries. meanwhile the german agencies for technical and financial co - operation ( the gtz and the west german development bank ) had their own health experts and professional external consultants , so that they no longer always needed professors and lecturers for expertise in this area . at the same time , the german universities could rely on previously established institutions for research and higher education in their partner countries\n. such institutions no longer had to be built from scratch as part of development projects  and probably would no longer have been built anyway within the new international health policies of the late 1970s directed towards primary health care .\nthis tacit institutional separation of medical academia and  development co - operation was partly stopped with a series of new initiatives after 2000 , when increased funding for global health emerged .\nfunds from implementing the millennium development goals ( mdgs ) , the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria ( gfatm ) and the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation ( gavi ) boosted research on neglected health issues and operational research in particular in the countries concerned  alongside these initiatives dominant activities with more immediate effects . at the 31st g8 summit in gleneagles in 2005\n, co - operation with africa was declared a task for all ministries of the participating countries , including those with responsibility for education and research and for health .\nit was thus taken beyond the narrower focus of development co - operation . \n\n  the ( re-)united germany reacted to these tasks by also providing additional funding and new medical research programmes . thus , the challenges of the 1960s in integrating public health and academic research on communicable diseases within the framework of international co - operation returned under the new conditions of twenty - first century globalisation\n. it will be interesting to see to what extent history repeats itself or whether fundamental changes in national policies , scientific attitudes and international co - operation since the 1960s lead to different results in the future ."}
{"id": 120, "text": "tracheobronchial rupture ( tbr ) is defined as any injury to the trachea or bronchi localized between the level of the cricoid cartilage and the lobar bronchi .\nruptures of the tracheobronchial tree are rare but potentially life threatening , usually resulting from blunt / penetrating chest or neck trauma .\ntbr has various clinical presentations from dramatic and fatal situations , such as tension pneumothorax and mediastinal emphysema or esophageal rupture into the tracheal lumen , to a less eventful course with only minor signs of perforation [ 1 -

threatening because of their influence on respiration , an improved transport system and emergency services has enabled increasing numbers of these patients to reach trauma centers .\nhowever , the diagnosis of traumatic tbr has often been delayed due to the occult clinical findings .\nthe large case series ( more than 10 patients ) have shown that the rate of delayed diagnosis of tracheobronchial injuries during the first 24 to 48 hours after blunt trauma varies from 5.0% to 80.6% , assuming these patients survived the initial trauma [ 3,12 - 16 ] .\nthese data demonstrate the difficulty in diagnosis of airway injuries and traumatic tbr requires a high index of suspicion for timely diagnosis .\nfurthermore , blunt tracheobronchial injuries have a significant diagnostic challenge . in our study , the delayed diagnosis and treatment group had more multiple trauma due to traffic accidents than the early diagnosis group .\nthe reasons for delayed diagnosis in blunt trauma are nonspecific chest wall trauma with rib fractures that may be presumed to be the source of pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum and involvement of multiple other organ injuries .\na review of the literature on tracheobronchial injuries shows that cases of delayed or missed diagnosis are often likely to require lung parenchymal resection and are associated with long - term complications .\nwe found that the patients who presented with a delayed diagnosis of tbr more frequently underwent lung parenchymal resection compared to the early diagnosis and treatment group . in our experience ,\nfurthermore , bronchial injuries with delayed diagnosis made it difficult to save the lung parenchyma .\nin our experience , group ii ( delayed diagnosis ) tended toward more severe injuries than group i ( early diagnosis ) .\nfurthermore , bronchial injuries with delayed diagnosis made it difficult to save lung parenchyma and lung resection often had to be performed . in conclusion , we believe that close clinical observation with suspect and rigorous bronchoscopic evaluation are necessary to perform diagnosis earlier and preserve the lung parenchyma in tracheobronchial injuries from blunt trauma ."}

{"id": 123, "text": "the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 ( gina ) was signed into us federal law on 21 may 2008 and will become effective within 12 - 18 months .\nthe first genetic nondiscrimination bill was introduced in the us house of representatives in 1995 .\nit took 13 years of lobbying from patient advocacy groups , researchers , medical professional organizations , and commercial interests to achieve bipartisan support for this type of legislation .\nalthough many us states have laws that protect against genetic discrimination   and there are some limitations to the use of genetic information imposed on group health plans by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ( hipaa ) , advances in genetic research have created an urgency to the passage of more comprehensive federal legislation . for many ,\ngina \" marks the beginning of a new era in health care \" in which \" [ i]ndividuals no longer have to worry about being discriminated against on the basis of their genetic information \" .\ngina was designed to protect individuals from discrimination on the basis of genetic information with respect to health insurance and employment .\nspecifically , it prohibits group and individual health insurers from collecting and using a person 's genetic information in determining eligibility and premiums , and it limits employers ' ability to collect genetic information and prohibits them from using such information in making employment decisions such as hiring , firing , job assignments , or any other terms of employment .\ngenetic information is defined broadly under gina and includes information about genetic tests on individuals and their family members as well as information about family medical history ( the manifestation of a disease or disorder in family members , including dependents and first , second , third , and fourth degree relatives ) .\na genetic test refers to an analysis of human dna , rna , chromosomes , proteins , or metabolites that detects genotypes , mutations , or chromosomal changes .\nsupporters of gina have applauded its passage into law and hope that it will alleviate the public 's concerns about genetic discrimination [ 4 - 6 ] , which many believe have discouraged the utilization of medically necessary genetic services and participation in important genetic research .\nsome argue that this fear is not warranted , citing a lack of documented evidence of discriminatory practices .\nyet , individuals report experience with genetic discrimination that has a negative impact on them and their families , and recent historical examples include mandated screening for sickle cell anemia among african americans .\nconcerns about genetic discrimination , which are not unique to the united states , have led to the enactment of genetic nondiscrimination legislation in many european countries . against a backdrop of relatively uniform general laws protecting the privacy of personal data ,\nthese genetics - focused laws vary considerably from country to country . in terms of defining genetic information ,\nmost of these laws are less inclusive than gina in that they tend to leave family history outside the scope of legal protection . in a recent article ,\nvan hoyweghen and horstman argue that , overall , this legislation has been less effective than hoped in preventing the misuse of genetic information and allaying public concerns about genetic discrimination , and it may have the unintended effect of increasing other kinds of discrimination .\nthe impact of gina on industry practice and public opinion in the united states deserves careful examination and should be a research priority .\ncritics assert that gina is not an optimal policy response to the concerns it seeks to address because it is not comprehensive , in two senses . in the first sense , gina is not comprehensive because it does not regulate health insurers ' and employers ' access to and use of all health - related information , or even all predictive information ( that is , information with possible relevance to future health states ) .\nsomeone considering genetic counseling or testing for the brca1 breast cancer associated gene can be assured that , after gina takes effect , their prospects for health insurance or employment will not be affected .\nno such assurance can be extended to an individual considering consultation with a mental health professional or a check of lipid levels .\n, federal law seems to fall short , another instance of ' genetic exceptionalism ' .\nthe necessity of defining and isolating genetic information from other kinds of information so that it can receive exceptional treatment introduces a new problem .\nas the scientific case builds for a multifactorial understanding of most diseases , and as information that has some claim to being genetic becomes integrated into routine care , any lines drawn may seem increasingly arbitrary .\nfor example , commentators have expressed some confidence that cholesterol tests would not be covered by gina .\nyet one might assert , not entirely implausibly , that testing to determine low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) levels in someone suspected of having familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic test .\ngina provides broad protections for information about genetic susceptibilities to disease , but it does not protect information about manifestations of a disease or disorder in the individual\n. the response could therefore be that high levels of ldl in such an individual would count as the manifestation of a disease or disorder , even in the absence of any evidence of atherosclerosis , and so any claim to protection under gina would be lost for that reason .\nthis serves to highlight another problem of where the line is drawn : what counts as a manifestation of a disease or disorder ? in the united states , the question of gina and justice is tied to an underlying problem : the coupling of a widely held belief that individuals should have access to health care ( regardless of health status and risk , at least to the extent that those factors are not wholly under their control ) and employment ( to the extent they are able to do a job ) with a system in which access to health care is by no means guaranteed and in which medical underwriting in health insurance has implications for employment . because employers are often providers of health insurance and face medical underwriting at the level of the whole company , they have reason to care about employee health for a reason that has nothing to do with job performance . for small employers , in particular ,\nan employee with the potential to generate high health - care costs is a threat to the welfare of the enterprise .\nit defines genetic information in order to make it off limits to health insurers and employers , preserving access to health - care and employment opportunities that would otherwise be imperiled by the general practice of medical underwriting ; but it leaves that practice otherwise unaffected and , at the point of actual illness , removes any protection from the harsh effects of the current regime .\nsome may fear that the passage of gina will serve as an escape valve , lessening pressure for broader health - care reform , but it could also be described as a step in the right direction .\nthe second sense in which gina is not comprehensive is that it fails to address fears about genetic information and access to other kinds of opportunities or insurance products , including life , disability , long - term care , and mortgage insurance .\npolicy issues related to life insurance and disability insurance have been studied at length , and in each area there are complexities that defy a simple ' one size fits all ' solution .\neuropean countries , less preoccupied with private health insurance , are ahead of the us in adopting nuanced regulatory approaches to other kinds of insurance , for example protecting access to policies in standard amounts and creating public entities to assess the actuarial validity of genetic tests . if significant sections of the public focus on these gaps in us policy , reluctant to enter the genomic era without a blanket guarantee against harm , gina may fail to live up to the hopes of its supporters . despite these limitations ,\nthe passage of gina is a major step forward in us policy . for the advocates who have worked tirelessly for many years to pass gina and for the patients , clinicians , and researchers who anticipate its benefits , this is a time to celebrate , not dwell on shortcomings . at last us citizens\nhave a floor of protection across all states and across all categories of core genetic information , including family history .\nthe effect that this has on clinical practice , if any , remains to be seen .\nclinicians may be more comfortable offering genetic testing , knowing that the results can not be used for employment decisions or to determine eligibility or premiums in health insurance .\nbuilding on gina , clinicians and researchers have an opportunity to improve their counseling of patients and potential research subjects . given the patchwork of protections that existed before the passage of gina\n, it would have been excusable to resort to a kind of warning like that given by police to criminal suspects that any information that results from this encounter / test / study may be used against you .\nit now becomes possible to inform patients and subjects that all health insurers and the vast majority of employers in the us will be prohibited from engaging in certain actions - thereby opening the door to tailored exploration of the areas of risk that remain ( that is , the types of health - related information and opportunities or insurance products that are not covered under gina ) .\nif we do our part in educating about gina , individuals will be able to make more informed decisions about genetic testing and participation in genetic research .\nalm is funded by the greenwall foundation faculty scholars program in bioethics and nih / nhgri -

on experience of different subtopic of phc and improving their critical thinking and problem - solving skills .\nthe curriculum also included exposure visit to sub center , primary health center , and community health center to have practical exposure to different phc resources .\nthe curriculum for phc module delivered to group b consisted of posting of md community medicine students at phc institutions for a minimum period of 6 months and relied on the principle of learning by doing .\nassignments were given on different subtopics of phc on a weekly basis to improve their understanding on the concepts phc .\ndifference in modality of teaching the summative assessment was done for both the groups to measure the effectiveness of different modalities of delivery of phc module .\nmultiple choice questions ( mcqs ) were prepared to assess the knowledge of phc among the study participants .\none hundred points  where each correct answer was scored  two and a half points  and each wrong answer was scored \nall study participants were informed about the purpose of the study and their verbal informed consent were taken .\nthe overall mean score and subtopic wise mean score of participants in both groups were calculated .\nall statistical analysis were done with the help of spss for windows , version 16.0 .\nthe overall mean score and subtopic wise mean score of participants in both groups were calculated .\nall statistical analysis were done with the help of spss for windows , version 16.0 .\nthere was statistically significant difference between two groups in terms of mean age and mean experience of working with the health care delivery system [ table 2 ] .\ncharacteristics of public health trainee by type of teaching modality overall summative assessment score among group a students was 63.9  10.0 in comparison to 61.1  10.9 in group b students .\nthe difference in total scores was not statistically significant . however , there was statistically significant difference between the mean score of two groups of students on topics evolution of phc : global prospective and elements of phc [ table 3 ] .\ncomparison of mean scores of the students in modular ( n=7 ) and conventional teaching methods ( n=9 ) by different topics covered in teaching the group a performed better on the topic , evolution of phc : global prospective compared to group b , whereas group b had a better score on elements of primary health care . both the groups had the highest score on the topic , evolution of phc : global prospective and lowest on models of phc . on an average , each student in group a did not attempt two questions out\nforty questions , whereas in group b average three questions were left unattempted by each student .\nthe overall lowest knowledge score achieved by study participants was 45 ( 45% ) in both the groups , whereas the highest obtained score in group one and two was 75 ( 75% ) and 80 ( 80% ) , respectively .\npgimer admits around five md community medicine and 14 mph scholar every year on the basis of all india entrance test . the eligibility for md community medicine course being bachelor of medicine and bachelor of surgery ( mbbs ) degree\ngraduates of mbbs , dental surgeons , veterinary surgeons , bachelor of engineering , and masters of social sciences and science are eligible for mph course . as a part of training , students perusing both\nthe residents of md ( community medicine ) are exposed to certain concepts of phc during their undergraduation ( mbbs ) course .\nthe prior exposures during the undergraduate period might have helped them in appreciating the phc concept .\nthe effectiveness of modular teaching method has been reported for undergraduate teaching in india and elsewhere . in our study , despite the different profile of the two groups , we did not find statistically significant difference in overall mean assessment scores between two groups .\nhowever , the difference between mean scores of the groups was statistically significant on topics evolution of phc : global perspective and elements of phc . group a students scored higher points on the topic evolution of phc : global perspective compared to group b. the reason for higher score among group a students may be due to nature of the topic and the activities assigned to the topic .\nevolution of phc being largely a theoretical perspective and the assignments were self - reading on classical articles related to origins of phc published in peer - reviewed journal .\ngroup b performed better on the topic on elements of phc compared to group a. this could be due the fact that they had more opportunity to gain knowledge on this topic due to practical exposure during serving as a primary care physician .\nthe major limitation of the study is that it has relied on the mcqs in the assessment methods .\nhowever , we used mcqs for the ease of administration and evaluation . the second limitation of the present study was the assessment focused on the gain in knowledge rather than gain in the skills and attitudes .\ncurrent trends in medical education focus on competency - based education and evaluation which addresses updation in knowledge , skill , and attitudes .\nwe conclude that approaching a complex topic such as phc requires a mix of both modular and nonmodular teaching to maximize outputs .\na sandwich model having hands - on practice spaced between two smaller modular training may serve the purpose ."}
