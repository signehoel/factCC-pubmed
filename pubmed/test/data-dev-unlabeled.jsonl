{"id": 0, "text": "anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] .\nalthough anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet ,\nour current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression .\noverall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance .\nfor example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] .\nlikewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] .\nhowever , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd .\none study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients .\nfurthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) .\ntwo further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent .\nthe first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) .\nfurthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together ,\nit is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning .\nit is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression .\ngiven that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety .\nfurthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship .\nseventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) .\nthe cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney .\ninclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) .\npatients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment .\nten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) .\npatients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) .\nthus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition .\nthis research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants .\nself - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd .\na cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) .\nthis criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups .\nthe neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way\nthis was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) .\nprocessing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) .\nattentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) .\nworking memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) .\nlanguage was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) .\nthe ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse )\ndemographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions .\nchi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups .\nall analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed .\nspearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions .\nas expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) .\ngroups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) .\nadditionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) .\nthere were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) .\nthe pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .\nneither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups .\nlogical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups .\nthere were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) .\nparticipants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety .\nlpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda.\nthis study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety .\nthe findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd .\nmore specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together ,\nthese findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] .\nalthough the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time\n, chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention .\nrecent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety ,\nfor example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety .\nit has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance .\nanxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses .\nthis further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study .\nnoradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd .\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] .\noverall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology .\nfuture research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related ,\nfuture research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients .\nresearch has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms .\nfuture studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients .\nprevious studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits .\nfor example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology .\nthus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial .\nit has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety .\nresults from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety .\nalthough these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically .\nrecent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings .\nbased on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain .\nfuture studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd .\nanother limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study .\nfuture studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd .\none advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression .\nalthough there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads .\ncontrolling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work .\nconsidering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd .\nanxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options .\nmoreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] .\nfuture research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog ."}

92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient .\nsubsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node - positive compared with node - negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via a heterotypic signaling .\nalthough the tendency for a global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested a general tumor suppressor function of mirnas , subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna - specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression .\nmany distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis .\nmirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type , culture conditions , target genes and pathway .\nthe involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently [ 21 , 22 ] .\nle et al . described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer , including let-7 , mir-34 , mir-125 , mir-200 family , mir-205 , mir-21 , mir-10 and the mir-17 -

regulation using a gnrh antagonist , ovulation triggering with a gnrh agonist and vitrification of oocytes or embryos  ( devroey et al . , 2011 ) .\nsevere and critical forms of ohss are associated with significant ascites  ( golan et al . , 1989 ; rizk et al . ,\nascites results in an increased abdominal pressure compromising venous return , cardiac output and renal perfusion  ( navot et al .\nparacentesis is frequently needed , as prompt drainage of fluid produces a significant clinical and biochemical improvement , including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process  ( rizk et al .\n, multiple paracenteses may be required to relieve symptoms and avoid serious sequelae of hemoconcentration , hypotension , decreased renal perfusion and severe respiratory compromise . instead of multiple interventions ,\nthe placement of a catheter temporarily for a few days will permit complete drainage through one procedure  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ) .\npigtail catheters have been used for drainage in various clinical situations . in a previous study we described the use of percutaneous placement of a pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites caused by severe / critical ohss  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) .\nin this study we established the efficacy and safety of pigtail catheter drainage in the management of severe / critical ohss in patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer at our centre between 1999 and 2001 on both inpatient and outpatient basis .\nthe aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with early onset severe ohss .\nthis is a retrospective study that included all patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and developed severe or critical ohss by the golan classification  ( golan et al . , 1989 ) in the period between 2004 and 2009 .\nall patients underwent an ultrasound evaluation which documented the presence of severe ascites and bilateral ovarian enlargement .\nall patients presented with shortness of breath , marked abdominal distension , nausea , weight gain and lower abdominal pain .\nthirteen patients complained of vomiting , and 3 patients reported decreased urine output  ( less than 720 cc per 24  hours ) and had haemoglobin   15 g / dl .\nall 33 patients were offered treatment using pigtail catheter insertion as an alternative to trans - vaginal paracentesis .\nblood studies including a complete blood count , creatinine , electrolytes , serum albumin and total protein , and coagulation panel were ordered prior to the procedure .\nall 33  patients were rehydrated with intravenous crystalloid solutions  ( 0.9% normal saline ) .\ncare was taken to give the patient the same amount of fluid as the amount that was drained from the peritoneal cavity .  \nall pigtail catheter placements were performed in the operating room at our surgical centre . the catheter  ( 6 - 0 french , 2.0 mm , boston scientific , quincy , ma , usa ) was introduced utilizing a non - disposable metal gamete intra - fallopian treatment  ( gift ) trocar and cannula  ( embryon gift catheter , ivf online , gilford , ct , usa ) which was introduced into the largest accessible ascitic fluid pocket in the upper outer quadrant of the abdominal wall under local anaesthesia and trans - abdominal ultrasound guidance . the trocar was then removed and a glide wire  ( boston scientific corp . , watertown , ma , usa ) was threaded through the gift canula . the canula was removed with care so as to keep the glide wire in the peritoneal cavity .\nthe pigtail catheter was guided into the peritoneal cavity by the wire after removal of the stylet of the pigtail catheter .\nthe catheter was anchored to the skin using 2 - 0 silk suture and it was supported by gauze , which was covered by a tegaderm .\nthe catheter was connected to a three - way stop cock which was connected to a drainage bag .\ninitial amount of drained fluid was calculated and subsequently the patients were trained to drain 1000 cc per day  ( 500 cc in the morning and 500 cc in the evening ) .\none liter normal saline and 500 cc of 6% hydroxyethyle starch solution  ( hespan ) was administered to the patient on the same day of pigtail catheter placement .\nany patient with critical ohss according to the golan classification , or those in whom the presenting symptoms and signs did not completely subside after drainage of ascitic fluid and iv fluid replacement , were admitted to the hospital for observation and further management .\nall other patients were sent home . once there was minimal or no drainage from the catheter , the patient returned to the office for removal of the catheter .\nthe patients were encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and to increase their protein intake .\nall patients kept a diary for body weight , abdominal girth , and urine output before and after the procedure .\npatients were seen in the office as needed for evaluation and hydration with normal saline .\ndemographic data including mean age  ( years ) , duration of infertility  ( years ) , bmi  ( kg / m2 ) and aetiology of infertility are illustrated in table i. ovarian stimulation data including number of treatment days , total dose of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone , hormone serum levels , endometrial thickness , number of follicles and number of patients receiving only 5000 iu of human chorionic gonadotrophin is illustrated in table ii .\nour data include the number of patients requiring early versus late placement of pigtail catheter , mean amount of ascitic fluid drained immediately after pigtail placement , number of days of pigtail catheter drainage and the number of days between oocyte retrieval and the onset of severe ohss symptoms requiring pigtail placement .\ntable iii also illustrates the number of patients who underwent coasting , number of patients who received prophylactic hespan on day of egg retrieval .\nvalues are expressed as mean + standard deviation values are expressed as mean  +  standard deviation : rfsh  =  recombinant fsh ; hmg  = human menopausal gonadotropins ; hcg  =  human chorionic gonadotropin ; e2  =  estradiol values are expressed as mean + standard deviation three patients  ( 9% ) required an early placement of a pigtail catheter while 30 patients  ( 91% ) had late placement of the catheter  ( table iii ) .\ntwenty - nine patients  ( 88% ) were managed on an outpatient basis without any complications .\nfour patients  ( 12% ) required hospital admission for 1 - 7 days  ( 3 + 2.7 ) , three for associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis .\nthese three patients were admitted to the hospital immediately after insertion of the pigtail catheter for management of severe pleural effusion and careful observation .\none patient was admitted 48 hours after insertion of the pigtail catheter for work up for chest pain , all tests were negative .\nnavot et al . , 1992 ; rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ) , but perhaps the most accepted classification of ohss is the one described by golan et al as mild , moderate and severe  ( golan et al . , 1989 ) .\nhowever , clinicians should be aware that ohss is a dynamic condition and moderate ohss may progress to severe ohss within hours  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ; rizk , 2009 ) .\ntherefore , the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine  ( asrm ) proposed a classification for ohss of mild , worsening and serious  ( the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) . recognizing the patients at high - risk , prevention and early recognition are the most important steps in the management of ohss  ( rizk , 2006 ) .\nhowever , severe forms of ohss , especially late onset type that occurs when patients are pregnant , most likely will continue to happen , albeit at much lower rate , unless one reverts to a total freeze of all embryos after the use of gnrh agonist as a trigger shot in a gnrh antagonist cycle  ( donoso and devroey , 2013 ; devroey et al . , 2011 ) .\ntraditional treatment consists mainly of supportive management until spontaneous resolution occurs  ( rizk , 1994 ) .\nalthough moderate ohss does not usually require intervention , outpatient monitoring is essential to identify progression to a severe form  ( rizk , 2006 ) .\npatients with moderate ohss can be managed on an outpatient basis by adequate hydration and close daily monitoring of weight gain and abdominal girth to detect progression to severe ohss , and to provide intervention , if required  ( rizk , 2010 ) .\npatients presenting with severe forms of ohss are usually managed on inpatient basis and most patients with critical ohss are admitted to intensive care units for aggressive supportive measures to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality  ( the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) .\ncorrection of hypovolemia , electrolyte imbalance and hypoalbuminemia are the basic principles during the treatment of severe ohss  ( rizk , 1994 , 2006 ; myrianthefs et al . , 2000 ) .\n( 1992 ) suggested that paracentesis is the single most important treatment modality in life - threatening ohss not controlled by medical therapy .\nparacentesis and removal of ascites result in relieving the pressure on the inferior vena cava and improvement in venous return , cardiac output and renal perfusion  ( padilla et al . , 1990 ) .\ntherefore , prompt drainage of fluid produces significant clinical and biochemical improvement , including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process  ( abuzeid et al .\n, 2003 ; the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) .\nit is also possible that removal of ascites decreases the amount of vegf and its effects on vascular permeability .\ntherefore ultrasound guided drainage of the ascitic fluid should be performed in severe cases of ohss with respiratory distress , oliguria or severe abdominal pain  ( padilla et al . , 1990 ) .\nthis can be done either trans - vaginally  ( aboulghar et al . , 1990 ) or trans - abdominally  ( padilla et al . ,\n1990 ) . however , recurrence of ascites is common in severe cases of ohss .\nplacement of a pigtail catheter has been proposed by some investigators to allow drainage of ascitic fluid whenever it accumulates without the need for further surgical procedures  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) .\nin a previous study we reported the use of percutaneous pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites in severe ohss as an alternative to repeated paracentesis  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) .\nthis procedure is relatively simple and requires a short period of time as compared to the time needed to gradually aspirate any fluid accumulation transvaginally .\nimmediate relief of symptoms and signs of severe ohss after pigtail catheter insertion was an important finding .\nin addition , the ease by which any accumulated ascitic fluid was drained resulted in a faster resolution of ohss  ( abuzeid et al . ,\nno infection was reported  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) . in that study the first 13 patients\nthey were discharged home with the pigtail catheter in place and managed on an outpatient basis until ohss subsided ; thereafter the catheter was removed .\nthe last 13 patients were managed on an outpatient basis without any problem  ( abuzeid mi , et al . , 2003 ) .\nour previous study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the pigtail catheter for the management of severe ohss .\ntherefore , we embarked on the current study to evaluate the role of pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with severe ohss syndrome . in the current study we demonstrated that patients who were diagnosed very early with severe ohss can be managed safely and effectively on outpatient basis using pigtail catheter drainage , iv fluid replacement and careful monitoring .\nalthough all 33 patients presented with shortness of breath , marked abdominal distension , nausea , weight gain and lower abdominal pain , and 13 of them complained of vomiting ,  ( all are criteria for hospital admission according to the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine on ohss ) , 30 patients were sent home as their presenting symptoms were relieved .\nearly diagnosis and intervention resulted in rapid elimination of the symptoms of severe ohss and normalization of vital signs , which allow us to manage the patients on outpatient basis .\nthe pigtail catheter placements were performed without complications and patients were discharged home after a few hours of observation .\nthe patients who needed hospital admission were those with associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis .\nanother patient was admitted to the hospital for 1 day for work up for chest pain and possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism .\nonce pulmonary embolism was ruled out , she was discharged home with a pigtail catheter in place and she was managed on outpatient basis .\noutpatient management of ohss has no place in those who fail to have complete resolutions of their symptoms , or those with severe hyperproteinuria or electrolyte imbalance .\ncertainly it has no place in patients with critical ohss such as those with severe pleural effusion , diminished urine output , severe hemoconcentration and those at increased risk of thromboembolic risks  ( rizk , 2010 ) .\nit is imperative to stress that such a protocol can only be used in patients who are motivated , reliable and have the necessary support at home to allow them to return to the clinic or go to the emergency room if the need arises .\nit also requires dedicated in vitro fertilization nurses to educate and follow up the patient on a daily basis .\ncontrary to other reports that state that access to intravenous albumin is a critical part of outpatient management for severe ohss , we did not use any albumin replacement  ( lincoln et al . , 2002 ) .\nthe reason behind the use of intravenous albumin is to increase intravascular oncotic pressure , thereby curtailing the exodus of free water from the intravascular space . in our study\nwe used hespan instead of albumin , as some investigators have shown that it is beneficial in reducing the incidence of severe ohss  ( youssef et al . , 2011 ) . by increasing the intravascular oncotic pressure\nin addition , the majority of our patients had late onset ohss as a result of pregnancy .\nhespan should be used with caution in patients with late onset ohss only when benefits outweigh risks.it is a fact that outpatient management of early severe ohss is a common practice among infertility specialists after trans - vaginal aspiration of ascitic fluid and iv fluid hydration .\noutpatient management by repeated abdominal or trans - vaginal paracentesis has been reported to be safe , effective and cost effective  ( lincoln et al .\n, 2002 ; shrivastav et al . , 1994 ; fluker et al . , 2000\n( 1994 ) were the first to suggest that day care management in patients with severe ohss with abdominal paracentesis and iv hydration was simple , safe and effective compared with traditional treatment with in - patient hospitalization and supportive measures .\n( 2002 ) concluded that the need for hospitalization for hyperstimulated patients can be minimized by outpatient management of severe ohss with trans - vaginal culdocentesis and rehydration with crystalloids and albumin .\n( 2000 ) advocated in a pilot study an active management strategy for moderate ohss , which involved early paracentesis designed to minimize the progression from moderate to severe ohss , instead of late paracentesis aimed at speeding up recovery in severely ill patients .\n( 2010 ) concluded that early outpatient paracentesis for moderate to severe ohss is the most cost effective management plan when compared with traditional conservative inpatient therapy .\n( 2009 ) reported a large series of patients with severe ohss in whom the vast majority were successfully managed as outpatients with use of aggressive trans - vaginal paracentesis  ( smith et al . , 2009 ) . despite the findings in our study\nit is important to emphasize that ohss remains a serious disorder with the potential for rapid deterioration , requiring hospitalization and intensive treatment of a critically ill patient .\nthe life - threatening complications of ohss are secondary to thromboembolism or compromised pulmonary or cardiovascular function and multi - organ failure\n. there have been isolated reports of women dying from the complications associated with ohss .\nthe mortality rate related to ohss is very low and was estimated by brinsden et al . \nmore recently , reports regarding maternal mortality rates due to ohss in the netherlands and united kingdom demonstrate an incidence of approximately 3 deaths per 100,000 in ivf cycles  ( braat et al .\n, 2006 ; lewis , 2007 ) . eleven lethal complications of assisted reproductive technology have been documented and summarized by braat et al . \nseveral investigators reported sporadic fatality as a result of ohss due to adult respiratory distress syndrome , massive pulmonary oedema , myocardial infarction , and carotid artery occlusion resulting in cerebral infarction . in this study\nwe describe a modified technique of what interventional radiologists usually use for pigtail catheter placement .\nwe observed that in the obese patients the metal introducer provided in the pigtail catheter kit is difficult to use ; instead we used the non disposable gamete intra - fallopian treatment trocar and cannula to facilitate the introduction of the catheter through the abdominal wall of such patients .\nthis technique helps to manage the patients in the office without the need for sending her to the hospital for an interventional radiologist to place the catheter .\nhowever , the patients in this study were identified from our in vitro fertilization database ; the study included every patient who developed severe / critical ohss .\nin addition , the lack of a control group that was managed without pigtail catheter placement limits the conclusions that can be drawn from our study . in summary ,\ndrainage of ascitic fluid in patients with severe / critical ohss is an important step in the management of this condition  ( rizk , 2010 ) .\nthe placement of a pigtail catheter resulted in a safe and effective outpatient management of the majority of patients with severe ohss .\nhowever , outpatient management of this potentially fatal condition requires clear understanding that rapid deterioration may occur , which may necessitate hospitalization and intensive treatment of a critically ill patient  ( rizk , 2006 , 2010 ) .\npatients with critical ohss and those with persistence of symptoms of severe ohss despite insertion of a pigtail catheter and drainage of ascitic fluid should be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management ."}

dependent diabetes can be induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin ( mlds ) ( 15 ) .\nthis model is a commonly used animal model that has many histological and clinical features similar to those of human type 1 diabetes and involves the participation of macrophages and t cells .\nstreptozotocin ( stz ) is a pancreatic  cell toxin that induces inflammation of the islets by immune cells when it is given in multiple low doses ( 16 ) .\nthis model of diabetes offers some advantages , such as simultaneous appearance of diabetes mellitus in all animals and not having immune abnormalities that may complicate studies in spontaneous diabetes in non - obese diabetic ( nod ) mice or bio breeding ( bb ) rats .\ntherefore , this model as a good model has been applied extensively to investigate the type 1 diabetes mellitus , especially study the immune pathways and modulations of autoimmune insulitis and  cell death ( 17 - 18 ) .\nc57bl/6 mice , also called  c57 black 6  or simply  black 6  has the advantage of strain stability and easy breeding .\nthe most common application of c57bl/6 mice is to serve as physiological or pathological models for in vivo experiments ( 19 ) . as such\n, mlds induced c57bl/6j mice were chosen to evaluate the anti - hyperglycemic activity of ptx and investigate the immunotherapeutic molecular mechanisms of how ptx attenuated the development of t1d .\nptx is commonly used for the treatment of microcirculatory disorders and yields only minimal side effects in patients .\nin addition , due to its varied immunomodulatory effects , ptx has been used in several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis ( 20 ) , multiple sclerosis ( 21 ) , and systemic lupus erythematosus ( 22 ) .\ndrugs that increase the level of camp , including pde inhibitors , are known to prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses ( 20 ) .\nprevious studies have also shown that ptx lowers blood glucose levels in diabetic animals ( 23 ) , and the results from the present studies also indicated that ptx possessed an anti - hyperglycemic property .\nmore importantly , the present data demonstrated that ptx could increase serum insulin concentrations in type 1 diabetic mice .\nit has been shown that ptx could reduce ( but not abrogate ) the insulin requirements or lengthen the  honeymoon  ( non - insulin - requiring ) period in a study of 21 children with new - onset type 1diabetes ( 24 ) .\nt helper 1 cells produce proinflammatory cytokines ( tnf- , ifn -  , il-1 , il-6 , and il-12 ) , which activate macrophages and cytotoxic t cells to destroy -cells , whereas anti - inflammatory cytokines ( il-4 and il-10 ) that are produced by activated t helper 2 cells , prevent -cell destructive insulitis ( 25 ) .\nil-10 has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in mice ( 26 ) . in response to cytokine stimulation , -cells generate reactive oxygen species ( ross ) and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide ( no ) , which facilitate their destruction ( 27 ) .\nno is also synthesized within cytokine - activated macrophages by inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) ( 28 ) .\nmore recently , the role of il-17-producing t cells have been demonstrated in the development of several autoimmune diseases , including multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes .\nil-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is detrimental to pancreatic islet cells ( 29 ) .\nil-17 promotes infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages , stimulates the production of other proinflammatory cytokines , including tnf- , il-1 , il-6 and il-12 , by activated macrophages and induces nitric oxide release from  cells that interferes with their function and cause -cell destruction ( 30 , 5 ) .\nit has been assumed that ptx similar to camp elevating agents , selectively suppresses the production of t helper type 1(il-2 , ifn -  ) , but not t helper type 2(il-4 , il-6 , il-10 ) cytokines ( 31 ) .\nhowever , it has also been demonstrated that the effect of ptx on cytokine production is cell - specific ( 32 ) .\nthe present study shows that ptx is not only able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ( ifn -  and il-17 ) , but can also increase the production of anti - inflammatory cytokines ( il-10 ) . since ptx has been found to be able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ( 33 ) , and favor th2 response ( 34 ) , it may indirectly interfere with the induction of inos .\nit has been shown that pde inhibitors elevate camp , prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses ( 35 ) and suppress proliferation of lymphocytes ( 36 ) .\nour findings are consistent with previous studies , showing that ptx treatment prevented lymphocyte proliferation .\nin summary , results of the present work demonstrated that the suppressive effect of the ptx treatment on t1d was accompanied by decreased blood glucose level , increased plasma insulin level , suppression of t cell proliferation , down - regulation of th1 and th17 cytokines ( ifn -  and il-17 ) and increase in the production of il-10 in supernatant of splenic culture of the treated mice .\nit seems that pentoxifylline treatment has a therapeutic effect against mlds - induced diabetes in mice ."}

although there was no significant difference between those with severe asthma and those with non - severe asthma in terms of the prevalence of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies ( 81.4% vs. 69.2% ) , mean levels were higher in the former than in the latter ( 1.65  3.25 ku / l vs. 0.54  0.72 ku / l ) . \n  in another study ( n = 210 ) , the same authors obtained similar results , the prevalence of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies being 76.1% in patients with severe asthma and 71.1% in those with non - severe asthma , mean levels being three times higher in the former than in the latter . \n \nbachert et al . found a significant increase in staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with severe asthma when compared with those with mild asthma and controls ( n = 70 ) . \n  in a more recent study ( n = 387 ) , the same group of authors found a significant increase in staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma ( 59.6% ) when compared with those with controlled asthma ( 40.8% ) and controls ( 13.0% ) .\nhigh levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies have been found to be a risk factor for asthma ( or = 7.6 ) and severe asthma ( or = 11.09 ) . \n\n  in latin\namerica , there have been no studies correlating staphylococcal superantigens with the severity of asthma .\ntherefore , we investigated a population of asthma patients treated at a university hospital in the city of rio de janeiro , brazil , and having no risk factors for increased staphylococcal colonization or infection in order to correlate the clinical severity of asthma with the presence of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies and degree of ige - mediated sensitization .\nthis was a cross - sectional study including adult patients clinically and functionally diagnosed with asthma and receiving outpatient treatment at the clementino fraga filho university hospital , located in the city of rio de janeiro , brazil . between 2009 and 2013 ,\nconsecutive patients were divided into two groups according to the clinical severity of asthma based on the global initiative for asthma criteria \n\n\n : the mild asthma ( ma ) group , comprising patients with mild intermittent or persistent asthma ;

in another study , they found a 76.1% prevalence in patients with severe refractory asthma and a 71.1% prevalence in patients with non - severe asthma . \n\n\n \nin one study , bachert et al . found a 38.1% prevalence of positivity for staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with asthma ( independently of disease severity ) and a 62% prevalence in patients with severe asthma ; in another study , they found a 59.6% prevalence in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma and a 40.8% prevalence in patients with controlled asthma , \n\n\n  the latter prevalence being closer to that found in the present study .  \naureus , such as sinonasal polyposis , bronchiectasis , chronic bronchitis , and atopic dermatitis , were not included in the present study . by facilitating colonization or infection with s .\naureus , the aforementioned conditions can lead to increased quantities of staphylococcal toxins in the body , resulting in increased ige - mediated sensitization and , consequently , a heterogeneous population of asthma patients .\nthe studies conducted by kowalski et al . \n\n\n  and bachert et al . \n\n\n  had no such exclusion criteria and included patients with chronic sinus disease and sinonasal polyposis , as was the case with the most recent study by kowalski et al . , \n  who nevertheless found no statistically significant differences between asthma patients with polyposis and those without regarding their levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies .\nthis might explain the differences between our results and those obtained by the two aforementioned groups of authors regarding the degree of ige - mediated sensitization .\naureus in the brazilian population ; therefore , it is currently impossible to determine whether or not it is lower than that in the european population .\nit is also impossible to determine whether the allergic immune response to staphylococcal toxins is lower in asthma patients in brazil than in those in other countries .   in the present study\n, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the frequency of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies .\nour results are qualitatively similar to but quantitatively different from those obtained by kowalski et al . , \n\n\n  who found significantly higher levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with severe asthma .\nin addition , our results are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those obtained by bachert et al . \n\n\n \nthese differences are also due to the exclusion criteria used in the present study , which were not used in any of the aforementioned studies , and to specific characteristics of our study population , as previously mentioned .   in the present study , ige antibodies to sea , seb , sec , and tsst\nwere found in 62 ( 43.7% ) of the 142 asthma patients analyzed , and neither the frequency of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies nor the serum levels of those antibodies were associated with the clinical severity of asthma .\nthese results are extremely relevant because this is the first study on this topic in latin america , the results of which differed from those of previous studies conducted in europe , indicating a \" negative \" association\n.   the limitations of the present study lie in the fact that it was a single - center study conducted at a tertiary care university hospital , in a single demographic area of brazil .\nour primary objective was to evaluate the influence of serum levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies and their association with asthma severity , meaning that this was not a population prevalence study of ige sensitization in asthma patients and healthy individuals in our region . if that had been the case , a much larger sample size would have been required , and it would have been impossible to obtain that in a single - center study .\ntherefore , in the present study , each group served as the control group for the other , without the use of a third group , comprising healthy individuals .  \nmulticenter studies in brazil and other latin american countries are needed in order to determine more accurately the role of ige - mediated sensitization to staphylococcal toxins as an aggravator of asthma , as well as to determine its prevalence in asthma patients and healthy individuals .\nsuch studies should include asthma patients with and without diseases that can lead to increased colonization or infection with s ."}
{"id": 6, "text": "the family is the cornerstone of human social support network and its presence is essential in everyone s life . changes inevitably occur in families with illness and hospitalization of a family member . in other words , among the sources of stress for families are accidents leading to hospitalization particularly intensive care unit ( icu ) .\nstatistics show that 8% of hospital beds in the united states are occupied by the intensive care units .\nstress in the family while the patient is in the icu can disrupt the harmony power of the family members and finally , it may causes disturbances in the support of the patient .\nin addition to the various sources of stress in intensive care units such as the patient s fear of death , financial problems , lack of awareness about the environment and etc . , their satisfaction level is another important source of stress for the patient s family .\ntoday , the family needs of hospitalized patients in the icu are summarized in five sections .\nthese factors may include receiving assurance , staying close to the patient , receiving information , feeling comfortable and receiving support .\nhowever , in many cases , the patient s family needs and their expectations in the icu will not be fulfilled which will cause dissatisfaction . since , how families deal with mental stress is the most important components of comprehensive care , it should be known that attention to the family needs of the patients hospitalized in intensive care units could increase their satisfaction and thus a reduction in stress disorders .\nstudies showed that the nurses in particular sections focus primarily on the patient and the disease .\ntherefore , attention to the families should be considered as an important part in patient management .\neffective interventions targeted at the needs and expectations of family members should help to reduce the stress and improve their satisfaction .\nfox et al . stated that the needs of the family members were not often overlooked by the nurses .\nhowever , the nurses spend a lot of time with the patients and their families and are in a good position to assess their needs and plan for meeting these needs with appropriate interventions .\nthe reason of investigating the satisfaction of the families of the patients in the icu is that the patients are facing life - threatening illness experiences and complex treatments , different technologies and different equipment are used for them .\nthese cases could potentially lead to the dissatisfaction of their families . in the meantime ,\nthe families of trauma and neurosurgical patients are more vulnerable than the other groups of patients .\nthey need supports that are more emotional and should be accepted by the icu staff . today , there are many theories expressed that in intensive care units , the patient and his family should be considered as a single unit . by providing care to this unit ,\nthe aim of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the families of icu patients .\nthe tool of society of critical care medicine s family needs assessment ( sccmfna ) ( which has been validated in 1998 by johnson ) was used in that study .\nthe results showed that most of the family satisfaction was related to the communication and patient care and the lowest level of satisfaction was about the ability of staff to patients family comfort .\nbailey et al . have conducted a study in 2009 with the purpose of investigating the relationship between informational support to families of special care patients and their anxiety and satisfaction .\nthey showed that there is a direct link between the informational support and their satisfaction .\nthe study of fumis et al . in 2008 also showed that the increase in the availability of physicians for giving the information to the patient s family and as well as nurses efforts to provide understandable explanations about the patient s condition to them will increase the patient s family satisfaction .\nthis clinical trial was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the interventions for the satisfaction of the patients in the special care units and their families in iran .\nthe purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital in 2010 .\nthe statistical research community was the families of hospitalized patients in neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra ( sa ) hospital , isfahan , iran from may to september 2010 .\nwith respect to inclusion criteria , the families of 64 patients were selected with simple sampling . after obtaining the informed consents from the hospitalized patients , by using the envelopes , which were prepaid by using a table of random numbers , they were divided into two groups ( intervention and control ) .\nthe inclusion criteria was included as the following cases : to be a first - degree member of the family , to be older than 18 years , willing to participate in the study , having the power to speak and write in farsi , to be hospitalized one day before the study , lack of physical or mental problem in the family member , no responsibility for the care of another patient , introduced as the first person responsible for the patient care .\nobtaining the written informed consent , completion of the questionnaires about demographic information and the families satisfaction were performed in the second day of hospitalization of the patients in icu in both groups .\njohnson questionnaire for the satisfaction of the family of icu patients was used to measure the family satisfaction .\nthe rating of the questionnaire was performed by using the likert scale with four options of 0 to 4 as follows : almost all the time ( 3 scores ) , often ( 2 scores ) , only occasionally ( 1 score ) and never ( zero score ) .\njohnson s questionnaire was the modified type of multer patient s family needs , which was evaluated in various scientific researches and there are extensive evidences for its validity .\nthe interventions were performed in the second and the third day of hospitalization of the patient in the neurosurgery icu by the researcher in the morning shift for the intervention group .\nthus , the researcher provided understandable explanations about the disease to the patient s family and answered honestly to the questions about the patient and the disease .\nthe researcher ensured them for providing the best care in the section and spoke about the prognosis of the disease .\nthe researcher took the family member to the patient s room and gave the necessary information about the room space , equipment , personnel departments and the actions that were done for the patient .\nthe patient family member was contacted if there was a change in the patient condition .\nthey let the family help the patient in some cases of the public health ( such as hand and foot massage and giving food ) .\nlocations of rest , nutrition , prayer room , bathroom and buffet of the hospital were introduced to them .\nthe telephone numbers of hospitals and wards ( and if necessary , the social worker and supervisor ) were given .\nvarious departments and personnel of the hospital were taught to accept the families and communicate with them . the hospital social worker was introduced and if necessary , the patient s family was allowed to express their feelings .\nthese interventions were performed in the evening shift of the second and the third day of the patient reception .\nthe actions were carried out by the fellow researcher . while , for the control group , only the routine work was done . on the fourth day , the satisfaction survey was completed by the selected family member in both of the intervention and control groups .\nstatistical methods used in this study were 2 test , man - whitney , independent student s t - test and paired t - tests .\nthe findings did not show statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups , such as : age ( p < 0.99 ) , gender ( p < 0.79 ) , marital status ( p < 0.41 ) , educational level ( p < 0.12 ) and relation with patient ( p < 0.54 ) . as shown in table 1\n, there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score before the intervention in the intervention and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) .\nthe mean satisfaction score after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly more than the control group ( p < 0.001 ) .\nthe mean satisfaction score in the intervention group after the intervention was significantly higher than before the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) .\nthere was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score in the control group before and after the intervention ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) .\ncomparison of mean satisfaction score ( 100 * ) of participants in the intervention and control groups the mean of satisfaction score changes of the studied subjects in the intervention and control groups after intervention\nthe results of the present study showed that the nursing interventions based on the family needs increased the patient s family satisfaction in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital .\ndue to the differences in the study design , study population , the number of samples and methods of intervention , it would be difficult to compare the results . in chien et al .\nstudy , the results showed that performing the training based on the patients family needs in the icu , decreased the anxiety and increased their satisfaction . in the study of myhren et al . indicated that effective communication of the staff with the families of icu patients would increase their satisfaction .\nin the study by rosher and robinson , it showed that involving the families in patient care led to increase their satisfaction than before the intervention .\nthe mentioned results were consistent with the results of this study , because all of these interventions were some parts of the interventions performed in this study .\nhowever , the study of steele et al . indicated that clinical training had no impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in the icu\n. therefore , there was no statistically significant difference in the satisfaction level in the control and intervention group .\nin this study , it was shown that the use of nursing interventions based on family needs ( confidence , support , information , proximity and convenience ) had significant impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in intensive care unit .\nthey should be based on the family investigation and recognition and their priority needs should be determined in order to cause the greatest satisfaction .\nthe icu nurses must also accept their role in the care of patient s family members .\nthe findings of this study could be a basis for performing further studies about family needs of the patients in the icu especially with the different forms of culture and economy .\nconsequently , the increase in family satisfaction of patients can reduce the stress disorders and improve their mental state and ultimately better support of the patient by the family .\nthis study only examined the effect of nursing interventions in the first days of hospitalization on the satisfaction of the families but the effects on the patient s entire hospitalization period has not been assessed . by performing other researches in this field\n, it would be possible to compare the differences in the effects of nursing interventions based on the needs of families in the early days and the whole period of the patient s hospitalization ."}

5 ] . nowadays ,\ncardiovascular diseases are among the most widespread chronic diseases in most countries . according to forecasts ,\nthe mortality rate in eastern mediterranean countries including iran will be 30 - 35% [ 6 , 7 ] . despite the emphasis on prevention and development of newtreatments , surgery is the only choice for many patients with cardiovascular disease .\none of the surgical procedures for the treatment of cardiovascular patients is coronary artery bypass surgery .\nin fact , heart surgery significantly influences on the quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases .\nhence , heart surgery is an important event in the lives of patients causing collapse of economic , professional and personal life . on the other hand , each surgical procedure\nis associated with several psychological complications for patients . of the most important complications are anxiety and depression so that approximately 65% of cardiovascular patients experience them after surgical and medical interventions .\nin fact , anxiety and depression complicate the treatment process [ 7 , 8 ] .\nsome scientists believe that anxiety is one of the essential elements of human life . however , acute and long - term anxiety is integral part of all psychological diseases . according to nemati and colleagues ,\nin fact , anxiety is a common psychological response of cardiovascular patients which is associated with reduced quality of life and psychological morbidity [ 11 , 12 ] . on the other hand ,\nanxiety causes increased heart rate and breathing as well as high blood pressure and even mortality .\nit is associated with increased risk of mortality , disability , increased medical care and functional impairment in daily activities [ 12 , 13 ] . clinical depression has been reported in 54% of patients after bypass surgery . according to world health organization ( who ) , depression is the fourth chronic disease where its disability is comparable with 8 major chronic disorders .\nthe outcome of depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is deterioration of physical and emotional state . given the incidence of such complications in patients with cardiovascular disease\nthe best practice in this area is appropriate communication with patient [ 13 , 15 ] .\ngood and effective communication is very valuable from the perspective of patients . in general , communication is a set of learning skills .\nin fact , poor communication is the cause of most problems in treatment of patients .\nin fact , communication at the bedside is a therapeutic and professional communication . in health professionals ,\ncommunication and communication skills play a very important role in satisfaction of patients and solving their problems .\nthis is more important , especially in patients with chronic diseases or those requiring long - term care .\nthe therapeutic communication is formed from the first encounter of the patient with the medical team [ 21 , 22 ] .\nhowever , studies have shown that the communication between patient and medical team is not efficient .\nthe health personnel don not have adequate communication skills . in fact , nursing and medical team spend very little time to communicate with patients .\naccordingly , patients are not often satisfied with received information as well as the level and method of communication .\nhence , to achieve best therapeutic results , special attention should be paid to communication [ 16 , 19 , 22 ] .\nsince nursing is a practical discipline based on professional knowledge , it is necessary to use knowledge infrastructure to develop new approaches in clinical practice .\ntheories proposed by nursing scientists can be useful in this area [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . for this purpose\nthe nurse - patient communication is an essential element of this theory [ 21 , 24 ] . according to peplau theory ,\nthe purpose of nursing care is to achieve a common good nurse - patient communication . according to peplau ,\npeplau refers to the importance of therapeutic communication with patients and its important role in reducing anxiety [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] .\nin fact , this theory provides a framework for nurse - patient communication . following this framework\n, the nurse will be able to respond communication needs of patients through establishing a good therapeutic communication with the patient [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] .\nhospitalization and a complex surgery such as heart surgery is a stressful process leading to depression in patients .\nfurthermore , the need for security and psychological comfort is one of the basic needs of patients achieved through a proper structured therapeutic communication with low cost .\naccordingly , the objective of the present study is to examine the impact of peplau therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary bypass surgery .\nthis is a clinical trial with pre / post testing scheme examined the impact of independent variable ( peplau therapeutic communication ) on the dependent variables ( anxiety and depression ) .\nthe population consisted of all patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass referred to the research environment on non - emergency basis .\nthe research environment was al - zahra heart hospital in shiraz due to the easy access to subjects and sufficient number of patients .\ndata were collected using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( kanter et al . ) .\nthe reliability and validity of the scale have been studied by montazeri et al in 2003 .\nan internal consistency of 78% and 86% was respectively calculated for anxiety and depression using cronbach 's alpha .\nthere are 14 four - option questions , each with a score of zero to 3 .\nodd and even questions are used to measure anxiety and depression , respectively ( seven questions to assess anxiety and seven questions to assess depression ) .\na score of zero to 21 is given to each patient based on responses in each area ( a score of zero - seven : normal , eight-10 : moderate and > 10 : disease ) .\ndue to the lack of access to error rate to calculate the sample size , 10 patients were selected as pilot ( with a depression and anxiety score of 10 or more based on the hospital anxiety and depression scale ) . after performing tests ,\nthe subjects were randomly divided into test and control groups ( using a coin ( toss ) ) .\nz12+z12s12+s22x1x22 the inclusion criteria were : being in a bypass list , having moderate to severe depression and anxiety scores , no history of mental illness , interesting in participating in the study ( i.e. the tendency of the patient and his family to participate in the intervention ) , lack of previous bypass surgery , aged between 35 and 70 years , ability to communicate verbally and ability to speak persian .\nthe exclusion criteria included : lack of cooperation of patients and families during the intervention , failure to perform coronary artery bypass surgery for various reasons , mortality during the study , failure to attend therapeutic communication sessions ( at least the absence in two sessions ) .\ntherapeutic communication sessions were held for the intervention group based on peplau 's model at four stages including : orientation , identification , exploitation and resolution . in total , seven sessions were held individually with the consent of the patient and his family at the hospital and patient 's home\n. it should be notedthat during therapeutic communication , duration of each session was variable given the location and patient 's needs .\nthe place of each meeting was determined with the consent of the patient . at all meetings , the researcher used verbal and nonverbal communication skills to communicate with patients . to ensure the correct application of therapeutic communication skills , a self - control researcher - made tool approved by experts was used .\nthe depression and anxiety of patients in both groups were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) at baseline and then two and four months after surgery .\nthe obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as covariance analysis with the help of spss 16 .\nthis study was approved by the ethics committee of the jondi shapoor medical university of ahvaz with rec.1392.58 code .\nthe ethical issues considered in this study include an adequate explanation for the patients and their permission to participate in the study , the lack of any compulsion for patients to participate in the study , refusing to disclose secrets or private matters of patients and confidentiality of information , announcing the results without names and personal details .\nfurthermore , the present study was registered with the irct2013072214110n1 code in clinical trial center ( irct.ir ) .\nthis study was approved by the ethics committee of the jondi shapoor medical university of ahvaz with rec.1392.58 code .\nthe ethical issues considered in this study include an adequate explanation for the patients and their permission to participate in the study , the lack of any compulsion for patients to participate in the study , refusing to disclose secrets or private matters of patients and confidentiality of information , announcing the results without names and personal details .\nfurthermore , the present study was registered with the irct2013072214110n1 code in clinical trial center ( irct.ir ) .\nthe percentage of male and female patients in the intervention group was 70.3% and 29.7% , respectively .\nthe percentage of males and females in the control group was 51.4% and 48.6% , respectively .\nthe status of the underlying disease was depicted in both intervention and control groups . according to results\n, the majority of patients were suffering from high blood pressure in both groups with a high frequency of 35.1% ( table 1 ) .\nas shown in table 2 , anxiety was reduced in the intervention group , while postoperative anxiety in the control group was increased . the hospital anxiety in the intervention group\nthis indicates the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication in reducing hospital anxiety of patients .\nanalysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on anxiety level of the subjects . since\nhospital anxiety scale was used to measure anxiety , analysis of variance was performed using hospital anxiety scores .\nthe results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of anxiety level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test .\nadjusted mean anxiety scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group .\nin fact , the mean anxiety scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test stages represent the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing anxiety in the intervention group ( f=174.02 , p=0.000 ) .\nmoreover , the anxiety level in the intervention group two and four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=38.37 , p=0.000 ; f=11.58 , p=0.000 ) ( table 3 ) . as shown in table 4 , the mean depression in the intervention group was reduced after the surgery . the mean postoperative depression in the control group was increased .\nin fact , the hospital depression in the intervention group was reduced after the therapeutic communication .\nthis indicates that the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing hospital depression .\nanalysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on depression level of the subjects . since\nhospital depression scale was used to measure depression , analysis of variance was performed using hospital depression scores .\nthe results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of depression level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test .\nadjusted mean depression scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group .\nin fact , the mean depression scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test indicate the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing depression in the intervention group ( f=163.27 , p=0.000 ) . such a difference is not observed in the control group .\nmoreover , the depression level in the intervention group four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=20.58 , p=0.000 ) . however , no significant difference was found between two groups in terms of hospital depression two months after intervention ( p=0.61 ) ( table 5 ) .\naccording to the results , peplau 's therapeutic communication is effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary artery bypass .\nit resulted in a dramatic decrease in anxiety and depression scores in the intervention group .\ndepression and anxiety are the most important preventive factors in cardiovascular diseases   causing disease rejection by the patient and reduce the incentive to treat and increase the likelihood of disease recurrence [ 25 - 27 ] .\nmost patients with coronary heart disease who survive after surgery resume their normal life after several weeks or several months .\nprevious studies show that patients suffer from anxiety and depression several months and sometimes several years after the surgery [ 26 , 27 , 29 ] .\ntherefore , follow - up and strategies to deal with postoperative psychological complications are of utmost importance .\nit is not possible except through establishing a coherent and targeted therapeutic communication . indeed , effective communication enables the medical team to identify patients needs and take steps to solve problems and meet their needs . according to dadashi , hosseini and moghaddam ( 2009 ) , staff had close encounters with patients in 85.5% of cases .\naccording to mastaneh and mouseli ( 2013 ) , the rate of respecting patient rights in terms of communication was 60% indicating a moderate level of communication skills . on the other hand , duration and how to communicate with patients , particularly in dealing with patients with chronic diseases are essential in the hope and positive attitude to treatment and follow - up after discharge [ 29 - 31 ] .\nin fact , the patient gains motivation to cope with illness and trust in nurses through proper therapeutic communication , because the care of patients with either physical or mental illness requires correct and consistent communication [ 30 , 31 ] .\ntherefore , implementing a communication pattern will help medical team to establish a proper communication .\npeplau 's model is one of these communication patterns . to communicate with patients , especially patients with chronic diseases ,\npeplau 's described four stages and defined roles for the nurse at every step as someone who is in close relationship with the patient [ 16 , 23 ] .\npeplau 's communication model helps nurses and patient to identify the disease , concerns and questions of the patient . through defining different roles for the nurse\nthis model refers to nursing skills and abilities to establish a simple convenient therapeutic communication .\nthe model enables nurses help the patient after discharge and to spend more time with patient [ 16 , 23 , 24 ] .\nfor example , it has been used in communicating with cancer patients and solving systematic problems of families [ 32 , 33 ] . in this study ,\npeplau 's communication models were employed as communication sessions for patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass through applying nursing roles .\nthe results showed that holding communication meetings with patients immediately after surgery dramatically reduced hospital anxiety and depression .\naccordingly , to improve the nurse - patient communication and establish more effective therapeutic communication processes which improves clinical basis and can have a positive impact on the treatment and discharge processes and rehabilitation of patients , especially in patients with chronic diseases , training courses should be included in in - service courses to train and introduce medical team with simple and inexpensive communication skills .\nfurthermore , there is evidence that workshops on communication skills for health team can improve health outcomes and satisfaction of patients .\nanother limitation of this study is the lower percentage of females ( 29.7% ) in the intervention group with respect to the control group ( 51.4% ) .\nthe lower anxiety score in the intervention group could be due to therapeutic communication but also to gender differences .\nto write this article not contributed any financial resources and costs are the responsibility of the authors .\nall rights of this article reserved is owned by the ahvaz jundishapur university of medical sciences ."}

binding sites , i.e. , the s189n change within antibody - binding site b ( 4,5 ) and the v226i and s227p changes residing in antibody - binding site d ( 4,5 ) . because of rotational restrictions , a proline substitution at position 227 ( s227p ) would typically give rise to considerable conformation change ; however , this particular substitution is located within a  barrel motif and therefore has little effect on regional protein conformation . cumulatively , field isolates characterized subsequent to this outbreak continue to exhibit these 4 changes , and they appear to constitute a distinct branch in the phylogeny of ha sequences when compared with h3n2 isolates from the 20032004 season .\n. this change may affect protein - protein interactions since it is immediately adjacent to antibody - binding site a , where neutralizing antibodies have been shown to bind ( 4,5 ) .\nfurthermore , since the k145n substitution is located within a glycosylation site , the charge alteration may affect glycosyl transferase activity , which results in altered glycosylation .\ndifferences in glycosylation have been shown to contribute to antigenic variation by preventing antibody binding to antigenic sites ( 15 ) .\nadditionally , 3-dimensional analysis suggests this amino acid substitution may also promote enhanced receptor binding since the asparagine r group is shorter , which may make binding requirements less stringent and the receptor cleft more accessible .\nthe 3-dimensional depiction provides a unique regional residue perspective , demonstrating how the rapidly evolving ha surface antigens in the vaccine strain differ at the molecular level .\ncollectively , the clinical isolates obtained from this outbreak in nepal can not be considered antigenically distinct from the a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain because only 4 of 9 isolates evaluated exhibited 4-fold lower titers by hi ( table 1 ) .\nfurthermore , the varying reactivity noted in several isolates from this outbreak having identical ha1 sequences is suggestive that other viral antigens aside from the ha1 protein may have contributed to the antigenic variability observed in the hi panel . with the exception of a / nepal/1670/2004 and a / nepal/1672/2004 , all isolates evaluated by hi ( table 1 ) exhibited identical ha1 amino acid sequences and varying antigenicity profiles to a / wyoming/03/2003 reference antisera .\none explanation for this observation is that genetic differences in other influenza surface proteins contribute to the observed immunoreactivity .\nalternative viral surface protein candidates include the neuraminidase , ha2 , and m2 glycoproteins , which have been shown to exhibit antigenic properties ( 1619 ) . in this report\n, we describe the genetic analysis of the ha proteins from viruses obtained from an early season outbreak and compare them to current vaccine strains .\nthree amino acids changes ( s189n , i226v , and s227p ) were noted in known ( 4,5 ) antibody - binding sites ( table 2 ) . the fourth change ( k145n ) , which was located within a glycosylation site , may enhance viral binding since the smaller asparagine r group is located close to the ha receptor - binding cleft ( figure 3 ) .\nphylogenetic analyses show that the nepal isolates make up a distinct branch in the evolution of h3n2 viruses when they are compared with vaccine and reference strains ( figure 2 ) . however , antigenic data appear more ambiguous , suggesting a multigenic effect that can not solely be attributed to properties of the influenza ha ( table 1 ) .\nstudies are in progress to characterize the neuraminidase , m2 , and ha2 proteins to determine the molecular basis responsible for antigenicity differences observed within isolates from this outbreak .\nthe k145n substitution change has become a marker for an increasingly large subset of the fujian - like viruses .\ncdc and the us department of defense have recently characterized viruses with the k145n change in singapore , taiwan , china , australia , canada , and the united states . in february 2005 , who reported the emergence of a new influenza h3n2 strain in the united states .\nthe a / california/7/2004 strain , which was first identified in the united states in september 2004 , contains all 4 changes observed in isolates from this nepalese outbreak .\nthe a / california/7/2004 strain differs by only 1 amino acid in ha1 ( which is of no immunologic importance ) from most isolates from the outbreak in nepal .\nall viruses characterized ( 150 globally isolated strains ) subsequent to the preparation of this report ( march 2005 ) by the us department of defense are genetically similar in amino acid sequence to these nepalese strains ( and the a / california strain ) .\nmost of the isolates ( 80% ) analyzed by cdc since october 2004 are antigenically related to a / california ( 20 ) , which indicates that this strain has emerged as the dominant influenza a h3n2 strain .\nthese data indicate that these viruses may persist as the dominant strain at the onset of the 20052006 influenza season . in february 2005 , who recommended inclusion of an a / california/7/2004-like strain in the 20052006 trivalent influenza vaccine to afford immunologic protection from this variant h3n2 virus .\nour findings emphasize the importance of continued molecular surveillance for characterizing emerging influenza drift variants ."}
{"id": 9, "text": "rising levels of obesity are becoming a worldwide phenomenon and are increasingly identified as a health problem across the globe [ 14 ] .\nhigher weight has been associated with adverse health indicators and outcomes , including cardiovascular disease [ 512 ] , stroke [ 5 , 13 ] , cognitive and functional decline [ 1418 ] , metabolic syndrome [ 19 , 20 ] , inflammation [ 21 , 22 ] , and mortality [ 20 , 2325 ] .\nobesity among aging populations is relatively recent and aging among people who have been obese for much of their lives is also a new phenomenon . from 1980 to 2004 , the prevalence of obesity in the us has continued to rise from about 17% to 25% for men aged 5059 . while obesity in england has also increased during this period , from approximately 9% in 1980 to 15% in 2004 for men aged 5564 , the level of obesity remains much lower in england .\nadditionally , the difference in obesity between the us and england is more pronounced for women .\nthe level of obesity in us women was about 24% in 1980 and rose to 37% in 2004 ( age 5059 ) ; in england , levels for women were 9% in 1980 and 14% in 2004 ( age 5564 ) .\nthe aim of this paper is to investigate differences in how obesity relates to indicators of physiological dysregulation in men and women of diverse populations .\nthis comparison will lead to an improved understanding of how obesity might be differentially related to health and mortality across cultures and lifestyles .\nobesity was relatively rare in most populations until the second part of the last century , but it has now become common in many countries\n. the us population is recognized as among the most obese in the world , although many other countries are now approaching the us level and most countries are experiencing increasing obesity .\nthis worldwide obesity epidemic began with the epidemiological revolution and the virtual elimination of infectious disease ; the decline in manual labor needed to provide sustenance with the industrial revolution ; and the increasing availability and decreasing cost of food [ 2729 ] .\nobesity reflects some combination of calorie intake , diet content , and amount of physical activity . in some cultures ,\nlack of physical activity can be a more important determinant of obesity ; in other cultures , overeating or food composition may be the more important determinant of obesity .\nit is also true that within countries , individuals could differ in the causes of obesity .\nfor instance , changes in activity might be more characteristic of women or men resulting in different reasons for obesity by gender .\nthese differences may affect how obesity is related to other risk factors for poor health , and it may determine the overall health risk associated with obesity . if physical activity is maintained , the overall effect of obesity may be less than if the activity is not .\none indication of the cause of obesity may be the relationship between waist size and weight [ 30 , 31 ] . in societies where obese people are more physically active , waist size of the obese\nwaist circumference has also been linked to late life mortality , where high waist circumference has been associated with increased mortality among men and women in the netherlands , while high bmi was not associated with mortality .\nthis paper builds upon current obesity research by using both bmi and waist circumference to quantify obesity in order to determine how a combined indicator of weight and adiposity is related to physiological dysregulation in populations with different cultures , diets , behaviors , and epidemiological histories .\nobesity has been related to many indicators of physiological dysregulation including cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension   and metabolic dysregulation in lipid levels or insulin resistance .\nmost studies that investigate the differences in biological risk associated with excess weight have examined western populations [ 33 , 36 ] .\ncomparative studies on the health risks associated with obesity that examined the us and england reported that obese americans had an increased risk of diabetes and a higher waist circumference [ 37 , 38 ] .\nthese studies suggested that differences in physical activity , diet , and social environments may explain these national differences .\nwhile these differences have been observed between the us and england , these two western countries have roughly similar life expectancy , levels of living , history , and culture even while the us has poorer health by a number of indicators of disease prevalence and biological risk [ 36 , 39 ] .\ncomparative studies of the links between obesity and health outcomes and risk factors for obesity comparing western and non - western countries indicate important differences in the causes and consequences of obesity .\na comparison of the association of disease with overweight and obesity in japan and the us indicated that the associations were stronger in the us than in japanese women and that there was no association in japanese men .\nlinks between social , demographic , and behavioral risk factors for obesity also differ markedly in japan , korea , and the us .\nthe availability of biomarker data from taiwan  a middle - income country undergoing rapid economic growth , increasing obesity , and with life expectancy recently increasing to levels similar to that of the us and england  allows for investigation of the biological risk associated with obesity in a population characterized by very different cultural , behavioral , socioeconomic , and dietary parameters .\nwe examine how elevated weight and obesity ( using an indicator that considers both bmi and waist circumference ) relate to having levels defined as clinical risk for cardiovascular , metabolic , and inflammatory markers in three aging societies that are now relatively similar in life expectancy but that differ in the timing of the epidemiological transition and obesity epidemic , history of economic development , socioeconomic levels , general lifestyle habits , health behaviors , and health care systems : the us , england , and taiwan .\nfinding differences in the relationship between obesity and indicators of physiological dysregulation in these three aging societies will clarify whether increases in weight gain are equally problematic across all countries .\nwe use data from three nationally representative samples : the us national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes , 20032006 ; n = 3855 ) , the english longitudinal study of ageing ( elsa , 2004 - 2005 ; n = 9139 ) , and the social environment and biomarkers of aging study ( sebas ) in taiwan ( 2000 ; n = 1023 ) .\nthese surveys collect information on demographics , as well as anthropometric , physical , and biological measures .\nevery year , approximately 5,000 individuals undergo detailed interviews and medical examinations , which include collection of several physiological measures .\nnhanes utilizes a complex sampling design , and when weights are applied , the sample is representative of the noninstitutionalized american population .\nwe use the 20032006 data since nhanes data is released in two - year intervals , and this sample is centered on 2004 - 2005 , which matches the period in which elsa was collected .\nfor nhanes , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 1,513 fasting individuals aged 54 and older .\nelsa includes participants drawn from households responding to the health survey for england ( hse ) in 1998 , 1999 , and 2001   and is representative of the english population aged 50 and older .\nthe core elsa sample ( wave 1 : 2002 - 2003 ) includes people living in an hse responding household who were born prior to march 1 , 1952 , and their partners who could be under age 50 . wave 4 of elsa ( 2008 - 2009 ) , which includes a nurse visit , includes wave 1 core members , if they are still alive and do not refuse further contact after the first interview at wave 1 .\nit also includes a refresher sample to maintain the age structure of the sample ( in waves 3 and 4 ) , and their partners . for elsa , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 7,384 individuals aged 54 and older .\nsebas is drawn from a follow - up survey of the survey of health and living status of the near elderly and elderly in taiwan ( also known as the taiwan longitudinal study of aging ( tlsa ) ) , a nationally representative survey of taiwanese adults ( including institutionalized individuals ) collected in 1989 , 1993 , 1996 , 1999 , and 2000 . in 2000 , a subsample of individuals was randomly selected for inclusion in sebas .\nsebas consists of adults aged 54 and older in 2000 , with in - home interviews and medical exams taken in a hospital . for sebas ,\nthe sample averages 66.8 years of age in england , and the us and taiwan mean age is about the same ( table 1 ) .\nthere are more men in taiwan ( 56% ) and england ( 53% ) and fewer in the us ( 44% ) .  \nwe examine the following indicators of physiological dysregulation often associated with obesity and also associated with increased risk for multiple adverse health outcomes and obesity [ 43 , 44 ] : ( 1 ) cardiovascular markers : high systolic ( sbp ) and diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) ; ( 2 ) metabolic markers : high levels of blood lipids ( total and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol , and fasting triglycerides ) , low levels of high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol , and high fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin ; ( 3 ) high levels of inflammatory markers c - reactive protein ( crp ; available in nhanes and elsa ) and interleukin-6 ( il-6 ; available in sebas ) , as crp and il-6 have been positively associated with bmi . for each indicator\nwe use clinical cutpoints or widely used research - based cutpoints to indicate high levels of risk which are shown in table 1 [ 39 , 43 , 45 ] .\nthere has been debate as to the best indicator of obesity : body mass index ( bmi ) or waist circumference .\nwaist circumference is thought to be a better measure of abdominal adiposity than bmi and a better indicator of risk of poor health outcomes , including all - cause and cardiovascular mortality [ 46 , 47 ] . for this reason\nwe investigate the association between bmi and biomarkers across categories of bmi ( underweight < 18.5  kg / m , normal and overweight 18.529.9  kg / m , obese 3034.9  kg / m , and very obese 35  kg / m ) and waist circumference categorized as normal or high waist ( high waist : men 120  cm , women 88  cm ) . we create a composite measure of obesity and adiposity by categorizing individuals into five groups : ( 1 ) underweight and normal waist ( all underweight individuals had a normal waist circumference ) , ( 2 ) normal / overweight bmi ( termed normal bmi ) and normal waist circumference ( reference group ) , ( 3 ) normal / overweight bmi ( termed normal bmi ) and high waist circumference ( termed high waist ) , ( 4 ) obese and high waist ( all obese individuals had a high waist circumference ) , and ( 5 ) very obese .\nwe also evaluate an alternate definition for obesity in taiwan based on bmi 27 , as it has been suggested by some that obesity levels should be differentially defined for asians [ 48 , 49 ] .\na similar composite measure of obesity and adiposity was calculated using this alternate definition of bmi in taiwan . because these risk factors are all assumed to be associated with obesity and because dysregulation in multiple physiological systems has been shown to predict many of the poor health risk outcomes associated with aging , we also create two summary measures of risk based on the total number of at - risk levels of biomarkers , either 9 or 8 . because crp values for sebas are not available , this measure\nis not included in the 9-item summary measure for taiwan , but a summary measure ( range 09 ) was calculated for taiwan using il-6 , another indicator of inflammation , instead of the crp values included for the us and england . a second alternate summary measure of biological risk , excluding the inflammatory marker ( range 08 ) ,\nbiological risk summary scores were computed for individuals who had missing values on no more than 3 biological markers .\nwe examine multiple covariates in our investigation of the relationship between obesity and biological risk .\nself - reported use of antihypertensives was determined in all three countries , and use of lipid - lowering statins was only asked in the us sample .\ndichotomous variables were created to indicate whether the respondent reported being a current smoker and participating in at least moderate physical activity for exercise ( e.g. , brisk walking , running , or swimming ) in the past 30 days ( for the us and england ) or generally exercising once a week ( for taiwan ) .  \nwe use logistic regression models to determine the odds of having at - risk levels of a specific biomarker for obese men and women among the three populations . for all countries ,\nthe comparison group for bmi and waist circumference is the normal bmi and normal waist group .\nthe regressions included indicators of age , use of antihypertensives , current smoking status , and having exercised in the past 30 days .\nordinary least squares ( ols ) regression models were used to determine the relationship between the summary measures of biological risk and the composite measure of obesity and adiposity .\nwe begin by examining national differences in the high risk levels of individual biomarkers ( table 1 ) .\nlow levels  or high risk levels  of hdl cholesterol are also more common in taiwan .\nhigh total and ldl cholesterol is more common among the english ; lower levels of plasma glucose , crp , and glycated hemoglobin are also characteristic of the english .\nfew adults in england have elevated levels of fasting glucose ( 2.2% ) , while this is observed in 17.3% and 13.2% of american and taiwanese adults . \n\nmost people in this age range are in the normal to overweight category ( 64.7% , 67.2% , and 89.4% in the us , england , and taiwan , respectively ) ( table 2(a ) ) .\namericans are more likely to be obese ( 33.7% ) compared to the english ( 32.1% ) and taiwanese ( 7.2% ) . among the obese , americans are much more likely to be very obese : 13.4% of the total us sample , 10.1% in england , and about 1% in taiwan .\nboth among the obese and very obese , the average bmi is higher in the us and england compared to taiwan .\nfew are underweight in any country ( 1.7% , 0.8% , and 3.4% in the us , england , and taiwan , resp . ) .  \nwhen we examine waist circumference , the us has the highest average waist circumference , with 65.5% of americans , 55.9% of english , and 15.8% of taiwanese having a high waist size ( table 2(a ) ) .\nthis means that high waist characterizes a substantial number of those who would be categorized as normal weight in the us and england . among those in the normal and overweight group about half ( 49.5% ) of americans and a third ( 36.4% ) of the english\nalmost all obese individuals have a high waist in the us and england ( 98.3% in the us and 96.5% in england ) , but only 78.4% of the obese in taiwan also have a high waist . when we use the alternate obese cutpoint of 27  kg / m in taiwan , less than half of the obese individuals have a high waist ( not shown here ) . \n\namericans exhibit the highest proportion of the older population taking antihypertensive medication ( 47.1% ) ( table 1 ) .\nthe percentage who reports taking antihypertensives is lower in england ( 32.0% ) and taiwan ( 28.6% ) .\namericans are more likely to be current smokers ( 24.5% ) than persons in taiwan ( 22.5% ) and england ( 13.9% ) .\nmore than half of the population in all countries report having exercised in the past 30 days , with more english exercising ( 82.2% ) compared to taiwan ( 61.4% ) and the us ( 58.5% ) . \n\nmen with normal bmi and high waist have a greater likelihood than men with normal bmi and normal waist size of having high - risk levels of triglycerides in all three countries . in the us and england ,\nmen with high waist are more likely to have high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and higher crp ; fasting glucose is also elevated among this group in the us ( table 3(a ) ) .\nmen who are obese in the us have fewer elevated risk factors than those with high waist who are not obese ; in the us , obese men are only more likely than normal weight men without high waist to have elevated glycated hemoglobin , fasting glucose and crp .\nenglish men who are obese have more elevated risk : both blood pressure indicators , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides , glycated hemoglobin , and crp .\nvery obese men in england have the same elevated risk factors with the exception of dbp .\nvery obese men in the us are more likely to have elevated fasting glucose in addition to crp and glycated hemoglobin .\nenglish and taiwanese women with normal weight and high waist are more likely to have elevated sbp , dbp , and glycosylated hemoglobin ; only british women with higher waist have significantly elevated triglycerides and only the taiwanese women had more hdl risk .\nhigh risk crp is more common among both american and english women with normal bmi and high waist , and this risk of elevated crp is also higher in the obese and very obese ( table 3(b ) ) .\nobese women in britain had elevations in the same markers as normal bmi and high waist english women , while obese women in the us only have elevated fasting glucose , glycated hemoglobin , and crp ; obese women in taiwan only had high dbp . with the exception of taiwan , levels of the inflammatory markers ( crp in the us and england ; il-6 in taiwan ) are more likely to be elevated among persons with a high waist and normal bmi , obese or very obese , compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts . among men ,\nan increase in the biological risk summary score ( range 09 ) is associated with having a high waist relative to being of normal bmi and normal waist in all three countries ( table 4(a ) ) .\nbeing obese or very obese is also related to a higher biological risk summary score ( 09 ) for men in the us and england .\nthese equations explain 6 to 11 percent of the variance in the summary indicator of biological risk .\nthese relationships are similar for women ( table 4(b ) ) , with one exception : obese taiwanese women do not have a significantly increased biological risk compared to their normal weight and normal waist counterparts .\nwhen we consider the alternate summary score that excludes our indicators of inflammation ( range 08 ) , being obese or very obese is no longer associated with a higher biological risk summary score in us men compared to men with a normal bmi and normal waist when controls for health behaviors and medication use are included ( table 5(a ) ) .\nthe size of the effects of the obesity categories is reduced on the 8-indicator summary measure in both england and the us , indicating the strong link between crp and obesity .\nthe r is also reduced in these equations for england and the us . for taiwan ,\nwomen in england and taiwan , but not women in the us , with a higher waist but who are not obese have significantly higher physiological dysregulation compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts .\nobese women in all three countries have elevated risk and the very obese have even higher risk ( table 5(b ) ) . the alternate biological risk summary measure ( 08 )\nyields different relationships between weight and physiological dysregulation in the us and taiwan . in the us ,\nonly very obese women have a higher alternate biological risk summary score ( 08 ) . in taiwan , obese and normal bmi and high waist women exhibit higher alternate biological risk summary scores compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts , except when smoking status , physical activity , and use of hypertensives are included .   figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) illustrate the predicted alternate biological risk score ( 08 ) for each weight category for men and women ( respectively ) aged 65 who are nonsmokers , do not engage in physical activity , and are currently taking antihypertensive medication .\nthis figure allows for country comparisons of individuals with these characteristics within each weight category and across weight categories .\nthe predicted values indicate that the us has the highest biological risk score within each respective weight category among men and women of the same age and lifestyle behaviors . with the exception of women in the normal bmi and high waist group ,\nengland has the second highest biological risk score within each weight category , followed by taiwan . among 65-year - old women with the noted lifestyle behaviors and with a normal bmi and high waist\nwhen we consider the alternate bmi cutpoint for obesity in taiwan ( bmi  27  kg / m ) , our findings for the individual biomarkers and summary measures of biological risk are similar to using the bmi  30  kg / m cutoff for taiwan except that the category normal weight with high waist no longer differs from the omitted category ( results not shown ) .\nthis study observes three general findings about how biological risk is associated with obesity in three countries that differ in lifestyle and culture .\nfirst , obesity is associated with physiological dysregulation in all countries with differences in the links between specific indicators of biological risk and obesity .\ngenerally , obesity in england is associated with hypertension , dyslipidemia , and elevated glycated hemoglobin ; americans who are obese are not more likely to have hypertension . in taiwan ,\nobese women are more likely to have elevated dbp and obese men have an increased risk of elevated triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin compared to their nonobese , normal waist counterparts .\nour biological risk summary scores indicate that at all levels of weight physiological dysregulation was highest in the us , followed by england ( with one exception ) , with taiwanese exhibiting the lowest biological risk in all groups among the three countries .\nsecond , these relationships remain after controlling for demographic factors , participation in physical activity , and other behavioral factors .\nthird , similar to obese older adults , high waist individuals with normal bmi also exhibit greater physiological dysregulation in all countries compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts .\nour finding of a higher physiological dysregulation , as shown by the alternate biological risk summary score , in taiwan compared to the us and england could be due to a couple of potential explanations .\nthe prevalence of obesity in the us and england is much higher than in taiwan , indicating an earlier initial rise in obesity relative to taiwan . from 1978 to 2002 , the proportion of obese americans and britons exhibited stark increases ( 1332% and 623% for men and women , resp . ) .\nthe estimates for obesity prevalence in taiwan indicate a recent increase for men but not women . from 19931996 to 2000 - 2001 , the age - adjusted prevalence of obesity rose from 10.5% to 15.9% for men and declined from 13.2% to 10.7% in women .\nit may be that the lower levels of risk among older adults who have lived longer years with obesity could be a reflection of better pharmacologic control of physiological dysregulation ( e.g. , through statin use ) , which may in turn confer less biological risk in these populations compared to populations of currently obese taiwanese adults who may have more recently begun living with obesity .\na second reason for the observed country differences in obesity may be due to differences in dietary habits and lifestyle .\nthe us and england are two modern , western populations whose diets have been influenced by increased industrialization and have over time come to be characterized by high glycemic loads and high fatty acid composition .\ntaiwan , on the other hand , represents a country that has experienced the effects of the industrial and scientific revolutions later than that of the us and england but is currently rapidly undergoing economic development and demographic change .\nthe recent economic changes in taiwan may indicate that obese older adults in taiwan have more recently begun to consume high - fat diets , which could result in greater initial physiological dysregulation associated with access to western - influenced dietary habits . despite controlling for lifestyle behaviors thought to be linked with health , the country differences in obesity and physiological regulation remain .\nmoreover , the consideration of antihypertensives does not alter our substantive conclusions on these associations .\nthis suggests that despite the greater use of medications to treat hypertension in the us , obesity among americans is associated with greater overall biological risk than the other two countries .\nthis is supported by findings from the general population of americans relative to england , which report that the us is faced with greater health disadvantages than england in adulthood   and across the life span .\nwe also note differences in biological profiles of obese individuals between the two westernized countries : the us and england . the excess risk of hypertension associated with obesity in england was not found in the us .\nthese differences may be due to the higher use of medications among americans compared to the english , with about 16% more men and 18% more women in the us aged 65 + taking antihypertensive medication compared to their british counterparts .\nthe greater use of hypertensive medications in the us is also noted when compared to japan and countries across europe .  \ntwo notable differences in country patterns of the relationship between obesity and physiological dysregulation by sex are found . among men in england and taiwan ,\nthe order of magnitude of physiological dysregulation increases with higher weight categories ; however , this is not observed for us men .\nthis difference may be due to our inability to consider statin use in england and taiwan , which may be particularly important in the relationship between obesity and physiological dysregulation for men .\nconversely , the importance of considering statin use may be less vital to understanding the country differences in the association between obesity and physiological dysregulation among women , given that the relationship for women is more consistent across countries , namely in the us and england .\nwomen , underweight corresponds with higher biological risk ( though nonsignificant ) compared to women with normal bmi and normal waist .\nunderweight among men in taiwan is significantly associated with much lower biological risk than their normal bmi and normal weight counterparts .\nfurther studies will be required to explore possible explanations for these differences in physiological dysregulation .\nthe higher biological risk observed among normal bmi and high waist individuals relative to normal bmi and normal waist older adults builds upon previous studies that report on alternate indicators of body shape , which vary across countries .\nthe importance of waist circumference is underscored by our current study , as well as a growing body of literature on the predictive value of waist circumference on indicators of health .\nhigher rates of diabetes among older americans compared to britons have been accounted for by high waist circumference as opposed to bmi differences . additionally , increasing waist circumference is more predictive of greater risk of incident diabetes than bmi in middle - aged british men ( and the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition ( epic)-potsdam study ) .\nwaist circumference , as an indicator of central fat mass , is thought to be more strongly associated with disease risk , and in our case with physiological dysregulation , compared to bmi , which is considered a cruder index of adiposity .\nbanks and colleagues   cite differences in physical activity , diet and greater psychosocial environmental challenges in america compared to england as potential mechanisms linking central adiposity and type 2 diabetes .\nour study considers some of these possible mechanisms ( e.g. , physical activity and antihypertensive use ) but finds that they explain little of the relationship between biological risk and adiposity among the three countries .\ntogether , these results highlight the importance of considering waist circumference in investigating the links between indicators of health and adiposity .\nour finding of the biological risks associated with obesity among older taiwanese adults underscores the growing concern for risks associated with obesity in countries rapidly undergoing modernization . in comparing the biological risk of obese individuals among the three countries , we are able to use these international comparisons to our advantage to examine how differences in modernization influence the health of older adults in different populations\nthis may have potential health policy implications that underscore the importance of addressing and controlling the rising obesity epidemic that has become most widespread in countries , like the us and england , that have long experienced high economic growth and in countries currently undergoing rapid economic development .\nthe increasing use of biological information to inform our understanding of health represents an innovative method in biodemography that will further contribute to the testing of current comparative theory and the potential creation of new paradigms surrounding the influence of modernization on health .\nfirst is the use of a broad range of biological markers across three large - scale population surveys . the inclusion of biological information as objective precursors of health allows , to some extent , a fairly comparable comparison of indicators of health across the different populations .\nan exception to this uniform comparison of biomarkers across the three surveys is our use of inflammatory marker crp in the us and england and our inclusion of a different marker of inflammation ( il-6 ) in taiwan . of note , crp seems to be more strongly associated with obesity than il-6 .\na growing body of literature has made distinctions between bmi and waist circumference , namely , suggesting that waist circumference is a better indicator of abdominal obesity , which in turn has been associated with obesity - related health risks .\nour findings generally report a similar association between increased biological risk and ( 1 ) normal bmi and high waist and ( 2 ) obese and high waist .\nusing the us nhanes ,   reported that when both waist circumference and bmi were included in their analyses , only waist circumference was a significant predictor of comorbidity . although this and other studies have suggested that waist circumference may be a better indicator of obesity and risk for adverse health outcomes , our study finds the two indicators to be similarly associated with biological risk across the three countries .\nfirst , we examine population - based data from three countries at a single time point .\nfuture studies of longitudinal data will allow for further investigations of the potential role of obesity on biological risk observed in the current associations .\nsecond , we do not have measures of some lifestyle and medical behaviors for some of the datasets ( e.g. , statin use ) , which likely influence the relationship between obesity and biological risk .\nas such , we are unable to include such factors in our analyses of all three countries .\nit is possible that these lifestyle behaviors are key explanatory factors to the noted cross - country differences in obesity - related biological risk .\nthe cross - country differences in the relationship between increased biological risk for individuals who are obese and have a high waist underscore potential differences in health and lifestyle behaviors .\nthese behaviors may be a result of country differences in economic development that we are not able to observe in this study .\nthe country differences in the links between obesity and physiological dysregulation are particularly marked when comparing obesity among taiwanese older adults relative to westernized populations , such as the us and england .\nfurther examination of these relationships over time and across other countries will contribute to our understanding of the potential factors responsible for these country - specific variations in biological risk , as obesity becomes increasingly more prevalent and older adults in various countries live more years with obesity and increased adiposity ."}

reactive proteins .\nclinical criteria included recurrence of severe and unrelenting back pain within first week of surgery , keeping patient awake at night after initial recovery .\nno biopsy of disc was resorted to ; however , mri of lumbosacral spine was ordered in all these patients which did not contribute much to the diagnosis .\nlizolid 600 mg / bd ) for first week followed by oral antibiotics for 5 weeks .\nall these patients responded well to antibiotics and no further intervention of any kind was carried out .\nafter initial back pain for 6 weeks , these patients had occasional residual backache which was treated by analgesics , activity modification , lumbar support , and rest during subsequent follow - up visits .\nnerve root injuries ( n=2 ) were encountered while trying to do a medial facetectomy to open the recess by a kerrison rongeur causing severe laceration of nerve root . however , nerve root was in continuity .\n, patties were used for gentle retraction and procedure of discectomy was successfully completed endoscopically without resorting to open discectomy .\n276 patients were able to return to sedentary work with an average delay of 2 weeks , except 24 patients who had complains of backache , occasional leg discomfort , discitis , and nerve root injuries .\nmedial facetectomy was resorted to in 59 patients to open the recess to decompress the nerve root in addition to discectomy .\nmixter and barr7 discovered the pathophysiology of discogenic sciatica and suggested laminectomy and discectomy as operative treatment .\nthe overall results of standard discectomy range from 68 to 95% in different series.8 the operative microscope and microsurgical techniques were developed in mid-1960 's by yasargil and krayenbuhl910 and these techniques revolutionized spine surgery leading to smaller incisions , less blood loss , increased visualization of site of pathology , decreased hospitalization , shorter postoperative recovery , and earlier return to activities compared with previous operative interventional techniques .\nthe results of microdiscectomy also range from 85 to 98%.1113 katayama et al.14 compared the results of open vs gold standard microdiscectomy and observed no difference between the surgical outcomes in both the groups but microdiscectomy gave better lighting , magnification , and therefore decreased the length of incision and tissue invasion .\nmicrodiscectomy also allowed the patients to return to early work with lesser use of narcotic medication .\nmicroendoscopic dissectomy ( med ) combines standard microsurgical technique with an endoscope , enabling the surgeons to address all types of disc herniations including decompression of nerve root and lateral recess .\nchemonucleolysis was reported by smith.15 nonetheless , based upon various randomized clinical trials , the efficacy of chemonucleolysis compared with more traditional and open procedures for the operative treatment of lumbar disc herniations remained speculative.16 the use of percutaneous nucleotomy , laser discectomy , and intradiscal electrothermal annuloplasty ( idet ) compared with microdiscectomy remains unclear , and it is attributed to the lack of high - quality studies.17 conclusions about the efficacy of some of the aforementioned minimally invasive procedures ( e.g. , chemonucleolysis , apd , idet ) were questionable with regard to disc - related pathology.18 therefore , lumbar microdiscectomy remained the gold standard for addressing a herniated or sequestrated intervertebral disc ; however , a movement toward more minimally invasive approaches that would yield superior outcomes , while minimizing excessive soft and bony tissue removal and minimizing soft tissue trauma , were sought . as such ,\nan evolution in procedures toward smaller incisions , less tissue trauma , and quicker return to daily activities took center stage in spine surgery .\nthe use of muscular retractor system was reported initially by faubert and caspar.1920 perez - curet and fessler,21 described for the first time a myriad of spine pathologies that could be addressed using tubeology .\nthough from our initial experience , endospine technique is minimal invasive , but limitation of study has been lack of comparison with gold standard microscopic discectomy technique .\nhowever , in a study by shin et al.,22 15 cases each were compared of med and microscopic group ( md ) .\nthe mean cpk - mm levels were lower for the med group than for the md group at both 3 ( 576.1286.3 iu / l compared with 968.1377.8\niu / l ) and 5 days ( 348.1231.0 iu / l compared with 721.7463.2 ) postoperatively ( p<0.05 ) . the mean vas scores for postoperative back pain were lower in the med group than in the md group , both at 1 ( 3.32.3 compared with 5.81.5 ) and 5 days ( 1.91.1 compared with 3.61.1 ) postoperatively ( p<0.01 ) .\naforementioned authors concluded that the med procedure is less invasive than md , and causes less muscle damage and backache .\nthe 90% excellent results in present study is comparable with other surgical procedures for herniated lumbar discs such as those of destandau , perez - cruet et al . , and\ntheir average surgical time was 66 minutes , average blood loss was 22 ml , average hospital stay was 7.7 hours , complication rate was 5% , reoperation rate was 4% , and average return to work was 17 days with excellent result in 94% patients .\naverage operative time was 50 minutes average blood loss was 45 ml ( range , 30 - 70 ml ) .\nreturn to work ( 21 days ) and overall results ( 90% ) which are comparable . in another prospective and randomized evaluation of surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniation by hermantin et al.,24 satisfactory results of 97% in endoscopic group ( n=30 ) and 93% in open laminectomy group ( n=30 ) were reported .\nhowever , in endoscopic group , these authors had excluded large central herniations and extra ligamentous herniations between l5 and first sacral vertebra .\nhowever , present endoscopic technique could be used for all levels and all type of herniations . in our current series , there was 5% discitis and 5% incidence of dural injury .\ncaspar and ebling,2526 authors have reported reoperation rate of 5.5 , 5.7 , and 3% , respectively .\nanother measure of success is reflected by the patient 's ability to return to previous employment .\nour patients returned to previous employment on an average at 15 days with restriction to avoid heavy manual work for 2 months .\ndiscectomy ( med ) by endospine system has claimed even lesser tissue invasion than microdiscectomy with even smaller skin incision , lesser use of analgesics , and early return to work .\nleast tissue invasion is established by many reports comparing the postoperative mri signal of paraspinal muscles,27 intraoperative electromyographic findings establishing less invasion to nerve roots,28 and by measuring serum levels of biochemical parameters reflective of a postoperative inflammatory reaction and damage to the paravertebral muscles.29 our personal opinion is similar , though this was not the parameter studied in our series .\nminimal invasive microendoscopic decompression technique has been used not only for paracentral disc herniations , but also for all types including far lateral , cephalad , caudal migrated , and central and recurrent disc herniations.3032 one of the driving forces behind the minimal invasive spine surgery is economics , shorter hospital stay , reduced postoperative morbidity , and quicker recovery times . in our series , 90% patients were operated as day care cases .\nposterior paraspinous process endoscopic access to lumbar disc herniation requires creation of working space where no or little space existed before .\ninternal view of operating site is magnified and well illuminated . with advent of this system ,\ndiscectomy can be done as day care procedure ensuring reduced postoperative morbidity , minimal or no hospitalization , less pain , and faster recovery .\nwith proper patient selection , discectomy and adequate nerve root decompression by doing foraminotomy or opening a lateral recess stenosis by minimally invasive technique can be achieved with this system .\nhowever , the endospine system has been excellent modality to address discogenic radiculopathy and to decompress lumbar canal stenosis .\nmany surgeons are convinced of advantages of the system and have included this system as part of their inventry . however , due to difficulty in orientation with scope and two - dimensional vision , availability of less space , frustrating and steep learning curve , and inability to master hand eye coordination , majority of surgeons are not able to continue with the technique .\nthe patience and persvrance to work through narrow confines and work closely with a surgeon who has mastered the technique is the key to learn .\nsecond step would be to become comfortable with 2 dimensional vision of endoscopic camera and to master orientation , triangulation .\ndepth perception in these techniques comes from experience rather than observation ; hence , surgeon keen to learn these techniques must combine these procedures during early phase of learning with standard procedures he is doing in his clinical practice . gradually , as surgeons master the learning curve , he will be able to use this as treatment method for his patients .\nthere is also a need to establish cadaveric labs and dummy models on line of arthroscopic learning centers where surgeons can practice hands - on cadavers and models to improve triangulation , depth perception , and hand eye coordination ."}
{"id": 12, "text": "medical tourism is illustrated as occurrence in which individuals travel abroad to receive healthcare services ( 1 ) .\nit is a multi - billion dollar industry and countries like india , thailand , singapore , malaysia , belgium , costa rica , cuba , dubai , hungary , israel , jordan , south africa and many others are being benefited in their economy by this recent phenomenon ( 2 , 3 ) .\nthe prime driving factors in medical tourism are increased medical costs , increased insurance premiums , increasing number of uninsured or partially insured individuals in developed countries , long waiting lists for procedures in countries having public healthcare system , availability of high quality services at affordable price , and cheaper airfare . increased communication and internet access in developing countries\nare other supporting factors , which help patients to develop awareness about international travel for medical care ( 47 ) .\nestimations can vary but still some of reliable sources claim ; gross medical tourism revenue worldwide was more than us$ 40 billion in year 2004 and reached up to us$ 100 billion by year 2012 ( 8) . in year 2007\n, it was estimated that around 750,000 us residents traveled abroad . accordingly , the base case estimated form 2007 to 2010 for the annual growth rate for outbound patients was 100 per cent in us ( 9 ) .\nforbes business estimated around 1.25 million americans were expected to travel outside for medical treatment in year 2014 ( 10 ) .\nafter thorough review it was found that there is huge gap in literature available in medical tourism .\naccounts detailing size and market of the industry are large in number yet there is scarcity of literature detailing about role and significance of different variables and linking them to form conceptual and theoretical framework which reflects decision making of international patients for taking part in medical tourism .\navailable literature explore various factors related to patients travel such as source of information , perceived risks , benefits of medical tourism and attributes of medical tourism destinations in sufficient amount but almost all of these related accounts are exploratory in nature and do not provide conceptual frameworks for testing .\nmany researchers ( 2 , 6 , 11 , 12 ) made calls to explore more about the decision making process based on conceptual models and test them empirically , so managers in medical tourism industry will be more acquainted about the needs and requirements of patients and design their future strategies accordingly and at the same time patients will also be benefited by receiving more quality services from the providers .\nthis article will draw a conceptual model based on patients source of information , perceived benefits , perceived risks , and medical tourism destination image with available literature that will be helpful to mangers to draw their future course of action for competitive advantage and at the same time fulfill the gap in available literature .\nimage formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place .\nvarious studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain destinations as possible alternatives ( 1317 ) .\nconsumer behavior studies have already established the effects of source of information on purchase behavior ( 18 ) .\namount and type of different information sources directly influence in development of cognitive image formation of destination ( 19 ) .\nsource of information is a vital antecedent of destination image formation and destination choice intention ( 20 ) .\nthere are four ( i ) professional advice ( tour operators , travel agents , airlines ) ( ii ) word of mouth ( friends , relatives , social media ) ( iii ) advertisement , and ( iv ) news / books / movies , different categories of type of information sources usually consider responsible for destination image formation ( 13 ) , this article use these four categories of source of information for medical tourism destinations image formation .\nmedical tourism facilitators are specialized in promotion of medical services abroad and offer supportive services such as assisting in selection of country and hospital , correspondence with doctors , travel arrangements , and arrangements of required paper work ( 21 , 22 ) .\njudgment of agent related to travel of their clients has high influence on decisions of clients ( 23 ) .\nthese facilitators serve as motivators also due to providing much - needed assistant to those unenthusiastic potential international patients who do not want to make their trip arrangements by their own .\nmany hospitals and clinics linked themselves with airlines to promote their services and offer discounts ( 2 , 5 , 2426 ) .\nliterature on medical tourism also reveals the role of practitioner in promotion of medical tourism mainly in underdeveloped countries due to various reasons such as lack of resources , unavailability of equipment , unavailability of infra - structure , unavailability of specialized manpower , and unavailability of medication ( 2730 ) .\nword of mouth and recommendation also has high influence in decision making of international patients in selection of destinations , hospitals , and doctors .\nstudies revealed large numbers of patients visit different countries for medical services were received recommendations from family members , friends , relatives , and colleagues ( 3134 ) .\nwebsites and online forums created by experienced international patients to share their experiences with medical tourism are also considered as decisive source of information for those planning to take medical services abroad ( 35 , 36 ) .\nprinted materials are also used to promote the services by hospitals and clinics , for example air mauritius in - flight magazine provides details about procedures and services provided by the hair grafting clinics in mauritius ( 2 ) .\nmajor medium of promotion of services by destination countries are trade fairs , travel markets / travel fairs , exhibitions , seminars and conferences to make potential patients informed about products and services offered by destinations .\nsome of these fairs and exhibitions are organized in collaboration with government agencies like tat , ministry of foreign affairs and department of export promotion but some providers organized these events by their own in cooperation with local institutes , medical schools and universities ( 37 ) .\nprint media play an important role in promotion and advertising medical tourism in major source countries , publish attractive and evidence based stories in their different segments related to health and travel .\nlos angeles time first examined about the growth of medical tourism and marked it as trend . later on new york times and los angeles times published stories of satisfied patients .\nfox , cbs s  60 minutes  and cnn aired their segments on patients traveling to medical services .\nmagazines like forbes and wall street journal analyzed the business aspect of medical tourism as  brokers assertively marketed medical tourism to consumers , employers , and insurers ( 38 ) .\nliterature revealed that not every physical attribute of a destination has influence on image formation process .\nthere is substantial inequality between descriptive dimensions of image and the attributes which are considered important for decision making within individuals ( 39 ) .\nit is generally presumed in marketing that products with similar characteristics will be equally preferred by the consumers , however , attributes , which make the product similar to other products , will not be necessarily same at the time of actual purchase . the importance of attributes will be change according to the need of consumer ( 40 ) . wish ( 1971 ) cited in ( 40 ) found that despite have many similarities individual like one country and dislike another one .\nthis is due to dimensions of liking may not be agree with the dimensions of similarity .\nliterature revealed that many researchers made distinction between physical and beneficial aspect of a product .\nfew researchers explained it as  characteristic and  benefits to the physical and beneficial aspect of product respectively ( 41 ) .\nthe typology of different attributes of product has been proven fruitful because by this a product s features can be segments into three groups as characteristic , beneficial , and imagery .\nthere are three components of vacation destination image formation ; ( i ) based on awareness : rely on the information sources , tourist believes about what a destination possesses , ( ii ) based on attitude : feelings and beliefs about destination , and ( iii ) based on expectations : expected benefits obtain from a tourist product ( 43 ) .\nthe above mention discussion clearly indicates that process of image formation is not just emphasis on physical attributes of destination but also depends on benefits or consumption values of product or service consumers hold in their minds .\nbenefits offered by a product or service are considered as consumption value of the same ( 44 ) .\nsheth , newman and gross ( 1991 ) developed a theory known as theory of consumption values , which focuses on consumption values of products and services ( 45 ) .\nconditional value. the decision making of consumer choice behaviour can be based on all five or any of the five consumption values .\nconsumption value model define the characteristics of  functional value as price , credibility , and durability .\nmedical tourism destinations offer very low price for medical services to international patients in comparison to developed countries , and most of the time price of a procedure in india and other asian destination is equal to 1/10 of price in us or european countries ( 4 , 4648 ) .\nquality of medical services is one of the aspects which drive medical tourism high towards success .\nmost of the hospitals in india provide medical care services to international patients are certified by jci which has reputation for hospital safety and regulatory management and recognized worldwide ( 49 ) .\nhigh procedure success rate also forms image as quality medical tourism destination of various destinations at south asian , african and latin america ( 48 , 49 ) .\nalthough availability of literature explain  social value in medical tourism is less , little available literature clearly define the \nsocial value aspect has been clearly observed in yemeni patients travel abroad for treatment ( 27 , 50 ) .\nsenior male members of the household consider it as opportunity to increase their reputation in society . availing expensive and prestigious medical care service in foreign countries and the associated sacrifices with it would make stories full of pride to tell to others ( 51 ) .\nmost of the citizens of yemen do not obtain resources to go for leisure travel at different parts of the world therefore traveling to foreign country for medical services provide chance to explore new territory , meet new people , and experience different social culture ( 27 , 50 ) .\nhowever , the concept of social value and epistemic value may not be associated with patients from developed regions .\nmany researchers found in their studies that patients were highly motivated to travel to a particular destination due to emotional attachment with doctor , hospitals or destination ( 6 , 50 ) .\nsuch as , many omani patients visit shiraz in iran for treatment due to religious and cultural familiarity ( 52 ) .\nconditional value can be considered as major factor pushes patients to travel abroad because medical needs are crucial and considered as unavoidable so have great conditional value .\nperceived risks is defined as perception of an individual about the probability that a particular action will lead them to a situation exposed with danger more than acceptable limit , and will lead to influence travel decision - making ( 53 ) . security and safety at the destination is major issue of concern by the potential travelers . in travel decision ,\nmaking perception of risks has utmost importance due to its tendency to alter destination selection ( 54 ) .\nresearchers argued in favor of conducting study on perceived risks and destination image together ( 55 ) . in tourism literature , authors considered safety and security at destination as one of the pull factors caused destination image formation ( 13 , 14 , 56 ) .\nhowever , in general cognitive image of destination does not engage with varied range of travel specific risks at destination and consider safety and risks as one of the many other attributes associated with destination ( 54 ) .\nin addition , at the same time perceived risks are considered as potential inhibitors of travel ( 57 ) .\nresearchers argued that using cognitive image to understand the dimensions of travel risks will be a conceptual mistake ( 58 ) .\nhence , perceived risks and cognitive image should consider individual variables for image related studies in travel .\ncredence goods as the quality of these good can not be assessed accurately even after consumption .\npatients may vulnerable to many risks if consider to take medical services at medical tourism destinations .\nresearchers described six dimension of risks associated with health travelers visited israel as  human - induced risks , \nfinancial risks ,  service quality risks ,  socio - psychological risk ,  natural disasters and car accident risk , and \nafter thorough literature review , authors categorized medical tourism destination perceived risks into three categories , as  physical - health related risks ,  service related risks , and  destination related risks. physical risks are considered as possibility of physical danger or injury detrimental to health where as health risks are considered as possibility to becoming sick while traveling or at destination ( 54 ) .\nin medical tourism , international patients can be exposed with different diseases , so risk of contracting with a different kind of disease is even higher such as blood borne infection and infection due to improper screening and storage of blood , deep - vein thrombosis ( dvt ) to those patients returning home after surgery , language related risks and lose of money can also be a matter of concern while involved in medical tourism .\nhealth risks for patients travel for organ transplant is even higher due to ignorance of standard protocol in donor selection ( 12 , 6062 ) .\nliterature revealed few american patients came in contact with non - tuberculous mycobecterial infection while taking treatment in hospitals abroad ( 63 , 64 ) .\nresearchers consider terrorism and kidnapping of rich patients and unstable economy of the destination as other risks associated with medical related travel .\napart from physical - health and service related risks , every destination have its own associated risks ; risks of terrorism , crime , and personal safety are associated with medical tourism destination due to falling in middle and lower middle - income countries in development status ( 63 ) . according to researchers , destination image is the total of ideas , beliefs , and impressions individuals possess about the attributes of destination and or activities available at a destination after processing information from various sources over a period of time ( 39 , 65 ) .\ndestination image as overall imagery picture individual obtains in his mind ( 66 ) . in the early studies on travel\n, researchers used the concept of stereotypic image of a travel destination ( 67 , 68 ) . later on , to understand the destination image formation process researchers developed an alternative framework and argued destination image consist of two components i.e. attribute based and holistic ( 66 ) .\nattribute based component refers to the perception of individual based on destination features and holistic component refers to imaginary mental image of destination .\nlater on , a bi - dimensional model was presented by researchers to represent destination image , consist of cognitive and affective image component ( 13 , 69 ) .\nthe cognitive component of destination image develops on knowledge and beliefs of destination based on tangible attributes , whereas affective component of image develops on emotions and feelings about the destination ( 70 , 71 ) .\nresearchers further studied affective image of destination and illustrate a four semantic differential scale to evaluate the affective component of destination image based on arousing \nfurthermore , cognitive component of destination image is an antecedent of affective component ( 72 ) .\nthus , a distinctive image of a destination forms in tourists mind based on strength and weakness of attributes of cognitive and affective components . image of destination formed in consumer s mind is defined as aggregate of attributes and beliefs ( 73 ) .\nit means if tourist has enough level of positive beliefs about attributes of destination it is expected that s / he has developed favorable attitude towards destination .\nthe process of destination image formation is described as mental construct of representation of destination based on information cues transmitted by image inducing agents chosen by individual ( 19 ) .\nafter thorough literature review authors identified four dimension of cognitive medical tourism destination image based of different attributes projected by different medical tourism destinations , as ;  medical amenities ,  general infra - structure ,  tourism attractions , and \nsocial environment. most of the hospitals websites are dominated with images stressing on sophistication , advanced technology , cleanliness and efficiency .\nmajority of these sites are in english highlight the variety of procedures , price , accreditation of hospitals , and affiliation of doctors , qualified and smart staff , lavishly furnished accommodations , and testimonials of past patients , and efficiency with different languages of staff .\ncommand on technology is rarely missed in any form of marketing ( 12 , 46 , 74 , 75 ) .\nbased on mentioned qualities , medical tourism destinations project themselves as most suited destination for potential travelers ( 28 , 32 , 76 ) . to nullify the quality related concerns of international patients hospitals and medical tourism facilitators / brokers emphasis on the markers of quality services .\nphysicians trainings in world reputed institutes like national institute for health , johns hopkins university , university of birmingham , and other reputed universities are highlighted in the profiles of physicians .\nprominent display of training and expertise of doctors achieve two goals ; established trustworthiness and mitigate concerns related to risk .\nthe accreditation awarded by jci is promoted by hospitals as mark of offering medical care of american standards ( 2 , 28 , 77 ) .\ncollaboration with prestigious hospitals in us and europe in also indicate seriousness towards providing quality services to patients by medical tourism hospitals at different destination ( 21 , 78 ) . distinguishing that major market drivers such as lack of health insurance and unaffordability are influencing patients to take procedures abroad , websites of brokerages predominantly display the comparative cost charts and price schedules .\nmost of the destinations claim providing significant cost services through different sources of promotion ( 5 , 79 , 80 ) .\nmost the promotions and advertisements show smiling , well - dressed and empathetic medical staff taking care of international patients .\nmany hospitals focus on multi - lingual staff providing services to patients speaking different major languages of the world .\nlanguage is also an influencing factor in decision making in selection of destination ( 11 , 37 ) .\nfacilities and quality of accommodation to international patients and their companions play important role in attracting the foreign patients .\nessential supportive services like local transportation services , food , communication , and others are also important in attracting the patients to a destination .\nthailand for example attracts more patients from developed countries because of already established quality tourism infrastructure offer excellent accommodation and hospitality services to international patients ( 81 ) . despite offering excellent medical care to international patients by hospitals in india most of the international patients visit india worry about accommodation quality , food hygiene , and personal safety ( 82 , 83 ) .\npotential tourists prefer to receive medical services to the places where they are also interested for holidaying ( 75 , 84 ) . after focusing on cost and reliability\nimage formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place .\nvarious studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain destinations as possible alternatives ( 1317 ) .\nconsumer behavior studies have already established the effects of source of information on purchase behavior ( 18 ) .\namount and type of different information sources directly influence in development of cognitive image formation of destination ( 19 ) .\nsource of information is a vital antecedent of destination image formation and destination choice intention ( 20 ) .\nthere are four ( i ) professional advice ( tour operators , travel agents , airlines ) ( ii ) word of mouth ( friends , relatives , social media ) ( iii ) advertisement , and ( iv ) news / books / movies , different categories of type of information sources usually consider responsible for destination image formation ( 13 ) , this article use these four categories of source of information for medical tourism destinations image formation .\nmedical tourism facilitators are specialized in promotion of medical services abroad and offer supportive services such as assisting in selection of country and hospital , correspondence with doctors , travel arrangements , and arrangements of required paper work ( 21 , 22 ) .\njudgment of agent related to travel of their clients has high influence on decisions of clients ( 23 ) .\nthese facilitators serve as motivators also due to providing much - needed assistant to those unenthusiastic potential international patients who do not want to make their trip arrangements by their own .\nmany hospitals and clinics linked themselves with airlines to promote their services and offer discounts ( 2 , 5 , 2426 ) .\nliterature on medical tourism also reveals the role of practitioner in promotion of medical tourism mainly in underdeveloped countries due to various reasons such as lack of resources , unavailability of equipment , unavailability of infra - structure , unavailability of specialized manpower , and unavailability of medication ( 2730 ) .\nword of mouth and recommendation also has high influence in decision making of international patients in selection of destinations , hospitals , and doctors .\nstudies revealed large numbers of patients visit different countries for medical services were received recommendations from family members , friends , relatives , and colleagues ( 3134 ) .\nwebsites and online forums created by experienced international patients to share their experiences with medical tourism are also considered as decisive source of information for those planning to take medical services abroad ( 35 , 36 ) .\nprinted materials are also used to promote the services by hospitals and clinics , for example air mauritius in - flight magazine provides details about procedures and services provided by the hair grafting clinics in mauritius ( 2 ) .\nmajor medium of promotion of services by destination countries are trade fairs , travel markets / travel fairs , exhibitions , seminars and conferences to make potential patients informed about products and services offered by destinations .\nsome of these fairs and exhibitions are organized in collaboration with government agencies like tat , ministry of foreign affairs and department of export promotion but some providers organized these events by their own in cooperation with local institutes , medical schools and universities ( 37 ) .\nprint media play an important role in promotion and advertising medical tourism in major source countries , publish attractive and evidence based stories in their different segments related to health and travel .\nlos angeles time first examined about the growth of medical tourism and marked it as trend . later on new york times and los angeles times published stories of satisfied patients .\nfox , cbs s  60 minutes  and cnn aired their segments on patients traveling to medical services .\nmagazines like forbes and wall street journal analyzed the business aspect of medical tourism as  brokers assertively marketed medical tourism to consumers , employers , and insurers ( 38 ) .\nliterature revealed that not every physical attribute of a destination has influence on image formation process .\nthere is substantial inequality between descriptive dimensions of image and the attributes which are considered important for decision making within individuals ( 39 ) .\nit is generally presumed in marketing that products with similar characteristics will be equally preferred by the consumers , however , attributes , which make the product similar to other products , will not be necessarily same at the time of actual purchase . the importance of attributes will be change according to the need of consumer ( 40 ) . wish ( 1971 ) cited in ( 40 ) found that despite have many similarities individual like one country and dislike another one .\nthis is due to dimensions of liking may not be agree with the dimensions of similarity .\nliterature revealed that many researchers made distinction between physical and beneficial aspect of a product .\nfew researchers explained it as  characteristic and  benefits to the physical and beneficial aspect of product respectively ( 41 ) .\nthe typology of different attributes of product has been proven fruitful because by this a product s features can be segments into three groups as characteristic , beneficial , and imagery .\nthere are three components of vacation destination image formation ; ( i ) based on awareness : rely on the information sources , tourist believes about what a destination possesses , ( ii ) based on attitude : feelings and beliefs about destination , and ( iii ) based on expectations : expected benefits obtain from a tourist product ( 43 ) .\nthe above mention discussion clearly indicates that process of image formation is not just emphasis on physical attributes of destination but also depends on benefits or consumption values of product or service consumers hold in their minds .\nbenefits offered by a product or service are considered as consumption value of the same ( 44 ) .\nsheth , newman and gross ( 1991 ) developed a theory known as theory of consumption values , which focuses on consumption values of products and services ( 45 ) .\nconditional value. the decision making of consumer choice behaviour can be based on all five or any of the five consumption values .\nconsumption value model define the characteristics of  functional value as price , credibility , and durability .\nmedical tourism destinations offer very low price for medical services to international patients in comparison to developed countries , and most of the time price of a procedure in india and other asian destination is equal to 1/10 of price in us or european countries ( 4 , 4648 ) .\nquality of medical services is one of the aspects which drive medical tourism high towards success .\nmost of the hospitals in india provide medical care services to international patients are certified by jci which has reputation for hospital safety and regulatory management and recognized worldwide ( 49 ) .\nhigh procedure success rate also forms image as quality medical tourism destination of various destinations at south asian , african and latin america ( 48 , 49 ) .\nalthough availability of literature explain  social value in medical tourism is less , little available literature clearly define the  social value factor with - in the patient groups especially from less developed regions .\nsocial value aspect has been clearly observed in yemeni patients travel abroad for treatment ( 27 , 50 ) .\nsenior male members of the household consider it as opportunity to increase their reputation in society . availing expensive and prestigious medical care service in foreign countries and the associated sacrifices with it would make stories full of pride to tell to others ( 51 ) .\nmost of the citizens of yemen do not obtain resources to go for leisure travel at different parts of the world therefore traveling to foreign country for medical services provide chance to explore new territory , meet new people , and experience different social culture ( 27 , 50 ) .\nhowever , the concept of social value and epistemic value may not be associated with patients from developed regions .\nmany researchers found in their studies that patients were highly motivated to travel to a particular destination due to emotional attachment with doctor , hospitals or destination ( 6 , 50 ) . such as , many omani patients visit shiraz in iran for treatment due to religious and cultural familiarity ( 52 ) .\nconditional value can be considered as major factor pushes patients to travel abroad because medical needs are crucial and considered as unavoidable so have great conditional value .\nperceived risks is defined as perception of an individual about the probability that a particular action will lead them to a situation exposed with danger more than acceptable limit , and will lead to influence travel decision - making ( 53 ) . security and safety at the destination is major issue of concern by the potential travelers . in travel decision ,\nmaking perception of risks has utmost importance due to its tendency to alter destination selection ( 54 ) .\nresearchers argued in favor of conducting study on perceived risks and destination image together ( 55 ) . in tourism literature , authors considered safety and security at destination as one of the pull factors caused destination image formation ( 13 , 14 , 56 ) .\nhowever , in general cognitive image of destination does not engage with varied range of travel specific risks at destination and consider safety and risks as one of the many other attributes associated with destination ( 54 ) .\nin addition , at the same time perceived risks are considered as potential inhibitors of travel ( 57 ) .\nresearchers argued that using cognitive image to understand the dimensions of travel risks will be a conceptual mistake ( 58 ) .\nhence , perceived risks and cognitive image should consider individual variables for image related studies in travel .\ncredence goods as the quality of these good can not be assessed accurately even after consumption .\npatients may vulnerable to many risks if consider to take medical services at medical tourism destinations .\nresearchers described six dimension of risks associated with health travelers visited israel as  human - induced risks , \nfinancial risks ,  service quality risks ,  socio - psychological risk ,  natural disasters and car accident risk , and \nafter thorough literature review , authors categorized medical tourism destination perceived risks into three categories , as  physical - health related risks ,  service related risks , and \ndestination related risks. physical risks are considered as possibility of physical danger or injury detrimental to health where as health risks are considered as possibility to becoming sick while traveling or at destination ( 54 ) . in medical tourism ,\ninternational patients can be exposed with different diseases , so risk of contracting with a different kind of disease is even higher such as blood borne infection and infection due to improper screening and storage of blood , deep - vein thrombosis ( dvt ) to those patients returning home after surgery , language related risks and lose of money can also be a matter of concern while involved in medical tourism .\nhealth risks for patients travel for organ transplant is even higher due to ignorance of standard protocol in donor selection ( 12 , 6062 ) .\nliterature revealed few american patients came in contact with non - tuberculous mycobecterial infection while taking treatment in hospitals abroad ( 63 , 64 ) .\nresearchers consider terrorism and kidnapping of rich patients and unstable economy of the destination as other risks associated with medical related travel .\napart from physical - health and service related risks , every destination have its own associated risks ; risks of terrorism , crime , and personal safety are associated with medical tourism destination due to falling in middle and lower middle - income countries in development status ( 63 ) .\naccording to researchers , destination image is the total of ideas , beliefs , and impressions individuals possess about the attributes of destination and or activities available at a destination after processing information from various sources over a period of time ( 39 , 65 ) .\ndestination image as overall imagery picture individual obtains in his mind ( 66 ) . in the early studies on travel\n, researchers used the concept of stereotypic image of a travel destination ( 67 , 68 ) . later on , to understand the destination image formation process researchers developed an alternative framework and argued destination image consist of two components i.e. attribute based and holistic ( 66 ) .\nattribute based component refers to the perception of individual based on destination features and holistic component refers to imaginary mental image of destination . later on ,\na bi - dimensional model was presented by researchers to represent destination image , consist of cognitive and affective image component ( 13 , 69 ) .\nthe cognitive component of destination image develops on knowledge and beliefs of destination based on tangible attributes , whereas affective component of image develops on emotions and feelings about the destination ( 70 , 71 ) .\nresearchers further studied affective image of destination and illustrate a four semantic differential scale to evaluate the affective component of destination image based on arousing \nsleepy , pleasant  unpleasant , exciting gloomy , and relaxing  distressing ( 70 ) .\nfurthermore , cognitive component of destination image is an antecedent of affective component ( 72 ) .\nthus , a distinctive image of a destination forms in tourists mind based on strength and weakness of attributes of cognitive and affective components . image of destination formed in consumer s mind is defined as aggregate of attributes and beliefs ( 73 ) .\nit means if tourist has enough level of positive beliefs about attributes of destination it is expected that s / he has developed favorable attitude towards destination .\nthe process of destination image formation is described as mental construct of representation of destination based on

cost and reliability\nprominent databases ( 2013 , 2014 , 2015 ) have been searched to obtain desire literature related to medical tourism including science direct , utmj.org , nih.gov , nchu.edu.tw , palgrave - journals , medretreat , biomedcentral and so on and the keywords used are medical tourism , information sources , medical travel , health travel and so on .\ngoogle search was performed to get latest data related to medical tourism . to know in detail about the variables used in the framework scientific research databases\nthe key words used to find out research variables as well as relationship between researches variables were destination image , destination information sources , beneficial image , perceived travel risks , cognitive image , affective image , consumption values and so on . to obtain data about medical tourism various types of available literature were reviewed such as industry reports , market research reports , media reports and internet sources , however for identification and explanation of variables scientific literature published in reputed journals only were included .\nthe theory of planned ( tpb ) is an established and comprehensively tested model details the relationship between beliefs , attitude , intention , and actual behavior of consumers ( 85 ) . the model is perfectly applied in a variety of studies including leisure and tourism travel , and hospitality ( 36 , 8688 ) .\nthese research studies emphases on the factors such as motivations , information sources , attitudes , and visit intentions , thus authors argue that attitudinal theory provides a sound foundation to understand travel intentions of international patients and underpin the conceptual model discussed in this article .\nstudies explained that consumers access more information in case of high association of risks or benefits or both in a particular act ( 89 , 90 ) and perform rigorous information search in case of planning first time trip ( 91 ) because first time trip is associated with unknown risks as well as unknown leisure activities .\nin general consumer behaviour practices risk - handling activity increases in case of high level of perceived risks .\nimportance of risk handling activity also determines by associated benefits gained after engaging with risk taking activity ( 92 ) .\nthe benefits of information search includes possibility of finding superior alternative to those already considered and the reduction in risk achieved from eliminating inferior , but a priori uncertain , alternatives ( 93 ) . with the discussion of above literature related to tourism\nit could be assumed that medical tourism information sources will have positive influence on perceived travel benefits of international patients . whereas , information sources of medical tourism will negatively influence perceived travel risks of international patients .\ndestination image is considered as perceptions or impressions of destination held by tourists with respect to the expected benefit or consumption values .\nthe benefits sought by the travelers are highly associated with the image of destination and the affective image of destination is largely highly influenced by the motivations / benefits sought by individuals ( 13 , 44 ) .\nthe affective image of a destination is more positive in individual s mind when emotions evoked by the place coincide with the benefits sought ( 95 ) .\nrisks and constraints associated with travel have significant impact on destination image formation at the time of early decision - making process ( 96 ) . according to researchers ,\ntwo dimensions significantly influence cognitive and affective image of destination ( 58 ) . on the basis of previous studies in tourism literature\nit can be assumed that perceived travel benefits of international patients will positively influence the destination image , whereas perceived travel risks of international patients will negatively influence the destination image .\nintention of visit related to travel is considered as tourists perceived likelihood to visit particular destination within a specific time period ( 97 ) .\nthus , to be closely correlated to the travel behaviour intention of visit believes as an important outcome variable in tourism research ( 16 , 97 ) .\nintention to visit a destination is highly influenced by cognitive / perceptual and affective evaluation ( 98 ) .\ndestination image is a direct antecedent of perceived quality , satisfaction and revisit intention and recommendation ( 99 ) . according to researchers\n, there is significant theoretical and empirical link between cognitive destination image and behavioral intention ( 100 ) .\nbased on above discussion it could be assumed that image of medical tourism destination will positively influence visit intention of international patients . conceptual framework  international patients travel decision making\nthe article is a sincere effort by authors to establish conceptual framework which explains decision - making process of international patients .\nthough , there has been advance in explaining different factors play important roles in international patients travel , however , there is scarcity of literature conceptualizing these factors into a framework and test it empirically .\nliterature reveals about associated benefits and risks related to travel abroad for medical purposes but do not conceptualize it in the process of decision - making .\nsources of information in medical tourism play significant role in development of attitude as well as intention , has already been established in consumer behavior .\nhowever , need is to test its significance in medical tourism decision - making process .\nthe proposed framework will encourage future researchers to test different variables empirically and establish the model of international patients travel behavior .\nethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or falsification , double publication and/or submission , redundancy , etc . ) have been completely observed by the authors

{"id": 13, "text": "squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( hnscc ) is a heterogeneous disease that includes tumors arising from the mucosal epithelial surface of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , and larynx . although these tumors originate within different anatomic sites within the upper aerodigestive tract , they are histologically identical ( 95% of hnscc are squamous cell carcinomas ) , share common etiologic risk factors and overlapping metastatic target site profiles ( reviewed in [ 13 ] ) .\nrecent genetic analysis of human head and neck tumors has revealed common molecular alterations including p53 mutation , p14arf , and p16 methylation , as well as cyclin d and egfr amplification [ 36 ] . despite these similarities ,\nthe distinct anatomic subsites are associated with differing rates of regional metastasis  for example , vocal cord lesions tend to metastasize less frequently than oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal lesions . this variation may be attributed to differing densities of lymph draining vessels within each of the relevant subsites .\npatients who exhibit metastases into the regional nodal basin exhibit a 50% decrease in survival irrespective of treatment [ 715 ] .\ncurrently , it is the 5th leading cause of cancer by incidence and the 6th leading cause of cancer mortality in the world [ 16 , 17 ] .\nrecurrent and/or metastatic hnscc patients have a poor prognosis , with a median survival of less than 1 - 2 years [ 18 , 19 ] .\nseveral lines of evidence indicate that cancer is a disease resulting from dynamic changes in the genome that promote the progressive transformation of normal human cells into highly malignant derivatives [ 20 , 21 ] . during this process ,\ncancer cells acquire several unique capabilities including self - sufficiency in response to growth signals , insensitivity to antigrowth signals , evasion of programmed death ( apoptosis ) , limitless replicative potential , sustained angiogenesis as well as invasion and metastasis , reprogramming of energy metabolism , and avoiding immune destruction [ 21 , 22 ] .\ndetailed global genomic analyses of several human tumors has revealed that certain classes of signaling proteins appear to be targeted more frequently by oncogenic mutations .\nreceptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) are a good example . of the 59 transmembrane rtks identified to date ,\ndysregulation of ~30 rtks are associated with neoplastic transformation and cancer progression [ 2325 ] .\ninterestingly , ninety percent of primary head and neck squamous cell cancers , irrespective of subsite , have alterations in members of the epidermal growth factor ( egf ) family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( erbbs ) , in particular erbb1/egfr .\nten to fifteen percent of tumors will also have an alteration in another egfr family member , the erbb2/her2/neu receptor [ 27 , 28 ] .\nthese findings suggest a strong etiologic role for rtk dysregulation in this type of tumors . given this association , patients with head and neck squamous cell cancers are well positioned to benefit from existing and future molecular targeted agents directed against oncogenic rtks such as egfr ( reviewed in ) .     \nrtks are a family of transmembrane proteins that mediate many important physiological processes in both normal and cancerous cells .\nligand binding to the extracellular domain of rtks induces receptor dimerization and activation of rtk activity .\nsubsequent autophosphorylation of the receptor at specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain generates binding sites for proteins that relay downstream biological signals to regulate protein function , protein - protein interactions , and gene expression . under physiological conditions ,\nrtk dysregulation can occur through several mechanisms including gene amplification or rtk overexpression , chromosomal translocation to produce constitutively active rtks , gain of function mutations or deletions that promote ligand - independent rtk activity , escape from negative regulatory mechanisms or local environmental changes , all of which lead to potent oncogenic signaling and hence neoplastic growth .\nthese complex signaling networks use multiple factors to drive the outcome of rtk signaling . although often depicted as linear pathways , they actually represent an integrated network with various modes of cross - talk , overlapping and distinct functions .\nknown signaling pathways involved in head and neck tumorigenesis include the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( pi3k)-akt - mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stats ) and raf kinase - mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( mek)-p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling pathways [ 1 , 30 ] .\nthis review highlights three rtk signaling pathways involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ; egfr , the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) and the hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) receptor ( met ) .\nthis short review will explore the relative contribution of each signaling axis to disease progression , potential modes of cross - talk , and targeted clinical approaches under investigation for disease management .\nthe egfr family of rtks is comprised of four different receptors known as erbb1 ( also referred to as egfr ) , erbb2 ( her2/neu in rodents ) , erbb3 ( her3 ) , and erbb4 ( her4 ) ( reviewed in [ 3133 ] ) . each receptor , with the exception of erbb3 , contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated by binding to extracellular egf - like ligands , which result in receptor dimerization and hence activation of downstream signaling cascades including mapk , pi3k / akt and stat signaling .\neleven egf - like ligands have been identified to date that can be categorized into four groups  those that bind egfr only ( egf , transforming growth factor alpha ( tgf ) , and amphiregulin ) , those that bind to egfr and her4 ( heparin binding - egf , betacellulin and epiregulin ) , those binding directly to either her3 and her4 ( neuregulin 1 and neuregulin 2 ) and her4 binding only ( neuregulin 3 and neuregulin 4 ) ( reviewed in ) .\nepigen , the most recently discovered member of the egf - like ligand family appears to be a low affinity and broad specificity ligand that effectively activates egfr .\nerbb2 is considered a ligand - less coreceptor as it does not have any known ligands that bind directly with high affinity , despite its established role as a potent oncogene in several cancer types including breast , colorectal , nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( nsclc ) and hnscc [ 36 , 37 ] .  \naberrant egfr activity has been strongly linked to the etiology of 5890% of hnscc [ 26 , 38 ] .\nthese rates can vary due to the inclusion of cancers from different subsites within the head and neck , methods used to assess gene amplification and tumor scoring methods . in contrast to lung adenocarcinomas in which activating egfr mutations result in ligand - independent signaling [ 3943 ] , such activating egfr mutations are infrequent in hnscc [ 44 , 45 ] .\negfr gene amplification resulting in upwards of 12 copies per cell has been reported in hnscc patients compared to copy numbers detected in normal mucosa from noncancer patients .\nthis and other pathways of ligand - independent receptor activation that do not require egfr overexpression have been characterized as the likely drivers of egfr activity in hnscc .  \negfr gene amplification remains a strong indicator for poor patient survival , radioresistance , and locoregional failure [ 4749 ] .\negfr overexpression is detected in healthy mucosa in cancer patients ( field cancerization ) that will increase in proportion to observed histological abnormalities such as hyperplasia , carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma , indicating that it is an early event in hnscc .\naccordingly , significant effort has focused on egfr signaling as a therapeutic target for treating hnscc patients .\ncetuximab , matuzumab and nimotuzumab represent humanized antiegfr antibodies , whereas gefitinib and erlotinib are small tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) ( figure 1 ) .\ncetuximab ( erbitux ) competitively inhibits endogenous ligand - binding to egfr and thereby inhibits subsequent receptor activation [ 5053 ] .\ncetuximab is a valuable treatment option in head and neck patients as it synergizes with current treatment modalities .\ncetuximab enhances the effects of many standard cytotoxic agents , including cisplatin ( the conventional platinum - fluorouracil chemotherapeutic ) , and in combination with chemotherapy it can elicit antitumor responses in tumors that previously failed to respond to that chemotherapy .\nnotably , cetuximab did not dramatically exacerbate the common toxic effects associated with radiotherapy of the head and neck , including mucositis , xerostomia , dysphagia , pain , weight loss , and performance status deterioration .\ncetuximab has been approved for use in combination with radiation for treating patients with locally advanced hnscc   and as monotherapy for patients with recurrent hnscc .\nmatuzumab ( formerly emd 72000 ) binds to egfr with high specificity and affinity to block receptor signaling , and also modulates antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( adcc ) when combined with cetuximab [ 5860 ] .\nphase i clinical trials report excellent antitumor activity of matuzumab against several human tumor types including head and neck cancers .\na randomized phase iib , four - arm , open - label study recently assessed the safety and efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination with radiation therapy ( rt ) or chemoradiation therapy ( crt ) in patients with advanced ( stage iii or iva ) hnscc .\nthe addition of nimotuzumab to both the radiation and chemoradiation regimens was reported to improve the overall response rate , survival rate at 30 months , median progression - free survival and median overall survival .\na combined group analysis of the nimotuzumab arms versus the non - nimotuzumab arms demonstrated a significant difference in overall survival favoring nimotuzumab .\nthis study is compelling as patient response rates compare favorably with studies combining cetuximab with radiotherapy , but with fewer side effects .\ngefitinib ( iressa ) is a small molecule tki - targeted to the intracellular active site for phosphorylation that has been tested in clinical trials involving hnscc patients , as a single agent or in combination with radiation treatment .\nunfortunately , gefitinib has shown limited clinical efficacy with response rates of 1015% [ 63 , 64 ] .\nerlotinib is a selective inhibitor of the egfr that also shows antitumor activity in hnscc comparable to standard combination chemotherapy .\nanother promising rtk under preclinical and clinical evaluation for head and neck cancers includes the igf-1r ( reviewed in [ 66 , 67 ] ) .\ntwo ligands , insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf1 ) and igf2 bind to igf-1r .\nligand binding to the igf-1r stimulates its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity , activating downstream signaling networks including ras - raf , mapk and erk , and pi3k ( figure 1 ) to drive cellular functions such as cell growth , survival and differentiation .\nit is widely accepted that the igf - axis activates antiapoptotic signaling , which in turn upregulates the pi3k - akt and mapk pathways in cancer cells .\nadditionally , igf - ir also regulates vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) production , suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis .\nseveral studies indicate that igf-1r is overexpressed and functional in 94% of hnscc patient samples [ 70 , 71 ] .\nconsistent with this , igf - ir signaling significantly enhances the proliferation , motility and tumorigenicity of human head and neck cancer cell lines . igf-1r\ndown regulation in a hnscc cell line using antisense oligonucleotides resulted in a dose - dependent decrease in cellular proliferation , induction of apoptosis , caspase activation and reduced expression of proangiogenic cytokines such as vegf .\ninterest in targeting the igf-1r in hnscc was bolstered by the observation that treatment of head and neck cancer cells with either igf or egf resulted in igf - ir and egfr heterodimerization [ 71 , 72 ] .\nhowever , only igf resulted in the phosphorylation of both receptors . using a mouse xenograft model for hnscc , treatment with antibodies against igf-1r , egfr or\nit remains to be determined whether cellular cross - talk between igf-1r and egfr has an important role in determining the biological aggressiveness of hnscc or resistance to egfr - targeted therapies .  \nseveral monoclonal antibodies and tkis for igf-1r have been tested in preclinical studies and early phase clinical studies .\nhowever , the efficacy of igf-1r - targeted therapy for treating patients with hnscc , particularly cross - talk with egfr , warrants further investigation . to date , the effect of blocking oncogenic igf-1r and egfr signaling have been studied more extensively in breast cancer cell lines [ 7375 ] .\ntreatment with gefitinib and ag1024 , a tki for igf-1r reduced cell proliferation when used as single agents and showed an additive effect when used in combination [ 76 , 77 ] . targeting igf-1r and egfr signaling is currently under evaluation in hormone - sensitive metastatic breast cancer using the igf-1r inhibitor osi-906 and the egfr tki erlotinib , although results are not yet available ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct01205685 ) . similarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc - a12 , a humanized antiigf-1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ) .\nthese studies will be critical for evaluating whether the use of anti - igf-1r and egfr - targeted treatments will be more effective than single - agent modalities for treating patients with hnscc .\nthe met receptor is a single pass transmembrane protein that upon binding its ligand hgf  also known as scatter factor - promotes increased cell proliferation , survival and motility ( reviewed in [ 78 , 79 ] ) .\nhgf is the only physiological ligand for met and is secreted as an inactive precursor polypeptide chain by mesenchymal cells .\nhgf is proteolytically cleaved to form an active / heterodimer by a number of serine proteases including urokinase plasminogen activator ( upa ) , tissue - type plasminogen activator ( tpa ) , coagulation factors x. xi and xii .\nmet is a disulphide - linked / heterodimer derived from the proteolytic cleavage of a 170  kda precursor .\nthe  chain and n - terminal region of the -chain form  sema domain , a seven -propeller structure in which blades 2 and 3 bind to hgf .\nthe sema domain is flanked by a cysteine - rich region followed by four immunoglobulin repeats .\nit is proposed that the cysteine - rich region and immunoglobulin repeat domains undergo a conformational change following hgf binding allowing for met dimerization [ 80 , 81 ] .\nbinding of hgf to met results in receptor autophosphorylation at key catalytic residues and subsequent recruitment of several cytosolic signaling molecules that are shared with the egfr and igf-1r signaling pathways , including the grb2/sos complex , the p85 regulatory subunit of pi3k , gab1 and jak / stat3 ( figure 1 ) .\nsubsequent activation of the mapk and jun - n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) pathways is responsible for the mitogenic and motogenic properties of met / hgf signaling resulting in  invasive growth  , depending on the physiological setting .\nincreased met signaling in human cancers can be the result of enhanced ligand - binding ( autocrine and paracrine ) , met overexpression or missense mutations that often induce constitutive kinase activity , failure of met down regulation and interactions with other cell surface receptors such as egfr ( reviewed in [ 8284 ] ) . met is overexpressed in 84% of hnscc patient samples .\ninterestingly , amplification of the met gene ( > 10 copies per cell ) is present only in 3 of 23 ( 13% ) tumor tissues .\nhgf overexpression is detected in 45% of hnsccs , suggesting that hgf functions predominantly in a paracrine manner to drive met signaling in these cancers .\nmoreover , high levels of hgf are detected in hnscc patient plasma samples   supporting the idea that ligand availability is not a limiting factor for met activation .\nmutations in the met ligand - binding domain ( t230m / e168d ) , transmembrane or jm domain ( r988c , t1010i ) and the tyrosine kinase domain ( t1275i , v14333i ) have also been identified in hnscc tumor samples , although their relative contribution to hnscc progression remains to be determined .\ntwo somatic met mutations have been detected in hnscc that result in constitutively active receptor signaling that confers an invasive phenotype when ectopically expressed in cell lines .\nthe y1230c mutation confers anchorage - independent growth and an invasive phenotype in transfected cells , whereas the y1235d met mutation stimulates epithelial cells to invade reconstituted basement membrane in the absence of hgf . in the case of the mety1235d mutation\n, genomic analyses of hnscc patient samples detected the presence of this mutant allele in 50% of metastatic tumors versus 26% in primary tumors , raising the possibility that this could be a critical genetic lesion for the acquisition of a metastatic phenotype .\nalternatively , increased met signaling could afford hnscc a selective advantage for growth and/or survival in metastatic sites , such as the lymph node and lung .\nindeed several studies indicate that met overexpression correlates highly with lymph node metastasis , pathologic stage , and disease reoccurrence [ 8891 ] .\nmoreover , patient survival was significantly reduced in biopsy samples with positive met expression relative to negative met expression , suggesting the association of met with hnscc disease progression .\nconsistent with these findings , treatment with the tki pf-2341066 caused a significant reduction in tumor growth , a high level of apoptosis and cellular debris within the tumor using a xenograft animal model for hnscc .\nselective inhibitors of met / hgf signaling include humanized monoclonal antibodies for hgf and met , and small - molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against met ( figure 1 ) .\nalthough their efficacy for treating a variety of solid tumors is increasingly recognized , we await results of preclinical and clinical trials for head and neck cancer that are ongoing .\nthe humanized antibody amg 102 shows high potency towards the mature and processed form of hgf with no detected effects on proteolytic activation of prohgf .\namg 102 interferes with met signaling , by competing with hgf for binding to the  chain of the met receptor . in phase\ni clinical studies in patients with advanced solid tumors , 70% of patients had a best response in terms of achieving stable disease [ 93 , 94 ] .\nimportantly , no antiamg 102 antibodies were detected and circulating hgf levels were dose dependent .\nanother promising clinical therapeutic is the one - armed 5d5 humanized antibody ( oa5d5/metmab ) directed against met .\nmetmab binds met with high affinity , preventing hgf binding , met phosphorylation , receptor internalization and downstream signaling events and has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in animal models by more than 95% [ 95 , 96 ] .\nmetmab is currently in phase i / ii human clinical trials in comparison with erlotinib in patients with nsclc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00854308 ) .\nfuture clinical trials will be required to determine the suitability of amg102 and metmab as either single agents or combinatorial therapeutics for treating hnscc patients .\nforetinib ( formerly xl880 ) is a tki whose primary targets include met and vegf , and to a lesser extent the platelet - derived growth factor ( pdgf ) receptor , ron , kit and tie2 rtks .\nforetinib recently completed phase ii clinical trials in head and neck patients ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00725764 ) .\ninterim results suggest that after 12 months , 12 of 18 patients had stable disease .\na phase i dose - escalation study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of xl184 administered orally to patients with advanced malignancies ( showed that , on average , patients survived for more than 3 months with several up to 6 months while on treatment ) ( reviewed in ) . due to\nencouraging data from this study , a randomized phase iii trial of xl184 in hnscc patients was initiated to investigate xl184 as a first - line treatment ( compared with placebo ) for survival benefit to patients with hnscc ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00704730 ) .\narq197 ( arqule ) is a nonatp - site competitive , selective small molecule inhibitor of the met intracellular region .\nalthough the mechanism of arq197 is presently unknown , the results of phase i trials suggest potential antiinvasive activity for this compound .\noverall , met , and hgf - targeted therapies have been well tolerated in clinical trials with negligible toxicities .\nhowever , it remains to be determined whether met is a better therapeutic target than hgf .\nclearly , in patients where met is activated by autocrine hgf secretion , both hgf and met targeted therapies may prove to be more efficacious treatment options .\nacquired resistance is likely the result of several mechanisms including ( 1 ) egfr mutations initially present as well as those acquired during therapy , ( 2 ) receptor independent activation of downstream signaling cascades , ( 3 ) cross - talk with other rtks and converging signaling pathways and ( 4 ) environmental factors including inflammatory agents and viral infection .\nresistance to cetuximab has been associated with the coexpression of the truncated egfr mutant , egfrviii with wild - type egfr .\negfrviii is the result of an in frame deletion of exons 27 spanning the extracellular ligand - binding domain .\nthe deletion results in a truncated egfr receptor that signals in a ligand - independent manner .\negfrviii expression has been detected in 42% of hnscc patient samples , and closely correlates with increased hnscc cell proliferation in vitro and increased tumor growth using in vivo xenograft models .\negfrviii preferentially activates the pi3k pathway instead of the ras / raf / mek pathway , which is activated by wild - type egfr . of particular interest to the therapeutic treatment of hnscc ,\negfrviii expression decreases the proliferative response of egfr expressing tumor cells to cetuximab treatment relative to vector control cells . in a recent study ,\negfrviii cells were shown to be resistant to the antiinvasive effects of cetuximab due to an increase in phosphorylation of stat3 rather than increased pi3k signaling .\negf - induced expression of the stat3 target gene hif1 was abolished by cetuximab in hnscc cells expressing wild - type egfr under hypoxic conditions , but not in egfrviii - expressing hnscc cells [ 102 , 103 ] .\nthese data suggest a role for egfrviii in mediating hnscc resistance to cetuximab .   despite egfrs critical role in the development of hnscc\n, clinical data indicate modest clinical benefits for locoregional control and survival of head and neck cancer patients treated with egfr - targeted therapies .\nhnscc patients resistant to cetuximab , often succumb to local tumor recurrence as well as regional and distant metastasis .\nthe addition of cetuximab to radiation therapy was reported to show improved locoregional disease control , progression - free survival , and overall survival in patients with locally advanced hnscc .\nhowever the data revealed a disproportionate benefit of cetuximab with radiotherapy to oropharyngeal cancer patients when compared to patients treated with hyperfractionated radiotherapy .\naccumulating evidence suggests that human papilloma virus ( hpv ) 16 status ( hpv+ ) is an important prognostic factor associated with a favorable outcome in a subset of head and neck cancers , including oropharyngeal and tonsilar cancers .\nhpv+ tumors tend to have unique genetic aberrations including decreased egfr expression , whereas increased igf-1r levels characteristic of hnscc appear to be independent of hpv status .\nclinically , hpv+ tumors are characterized by more favorable patient prognosis regarding disease - free survival as well as overall survival [ 104 , 105 ] , possibly as a result of increased genomic stability associated with global gene hypermethylation in hpv+ tumors .\nthus it will be interesting to determine whether hpv+ status explains some of the benefits derived from the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy in this subset of hnscc patients . at present\n, there are few clinical indicators of which hnscc patients will most likely respond to egfr - targeted therapies .\naccordingly , strategies to optimize egfr - targeted therapy remain an active area of research .\nadditional mechanisms that result in egfr activation include activating mutations in downstream signaling components or cross - talk between different rtk pathways . activating mutations in the pi3ka oncogene\noccurs in 10% of hnscc tumors   whereas elevated levels of phosphorylated stat3 correlates with lymph node metastasis and poor patient prognosis [ 108110 ] .\nconversely , h - ras mutations are infrequent in hnscc cases ( less than 5% ) , although a higher incidence has been detected in asian populations and correlates with areca nut chewing [ 111 , 112 ] .\nmet signaling has been shown to contribute to resistance in cell lines derived from multiple tumor types including breast , gastric and lung .\nin one key study , nsclc with activating mutations in the egfr acquire resistance to the tki gefitinib and erlotinib , by amplification of the met gene to maintain akt and her3 signaling .\nthese studies underscore the role of cross - talk between rtks to preferentially signal through the pi3k - akt survival pathway as a mechanism for acquired drug resistance .\nthe relevance of met as a mechanism for escape from egfr - targeted therapy in head and neck cancers remains to be determined .\nhypoxia results in the transcriptional upregulation of met gene expression via hif1 in a number of tumors including head and neck , often downstream of egfr signaling . in normoxia\n, hydroxylation of 2 prolines in hif1 enables its binding to the von hippel - lindau tumor suppressor protein ( pvhl ) linking hif1 to a ubiquitin ligase complex . during hypoxia , minimal or no hydroxylation occurs enabling hif1 to avoid proteasomal degradation and\ndimerize to other hif family members such as hif1   and coactivators , to form an active transcriptional hif complex on the hypoxia response element ( hre ) of target genes such as met .\nthe ubiquitin ligase catalyzes polyubiquitination of hif1 targeting it for proteasomal degradation . under hypoxic conditions ,\nincreased met signaling directs the invasive growth program , enabling cells to invade more oxygenated tissues .\nsince met has been reported to promote invasive and angiogenic effects in the tumor microenvironment , the use of hgf / met inhibitors may afford a means of impairing tissue colonization as well as tumor vascularization in head and neck cancer patients .     \nstudies on other solid tumor types , most notably glioblastoma , indicate a role for igf-1r upregulation in resistance to egfr - targeted therapies .\nigf-1r mediates resistance to anti - egfr therapy in primary glioblastoma through the continued activation of the pi3k / akt survival pathway .\nthe apparent cooperation between igf-1r and egfr in promoting hnscc pathogenesis as well as resistance to egfr - targeted therapy , suggests an advantage to cotargeting these signaling axes for the treatment of head and neck cancers . to date , the effect of blocking oncogenic igf-1r and egfr signaling have been studied more extensively in breast cancer lines .\ntreatment with gefitinib and ag1024 , a tki for igf-1r reduced cell proliferation when used as single agents and showed an additive effect when used in combination [ 76 , 77 ] .\ntargeting igf-1r and egfr signaling is currently under evaluation in hormone - sensitive metastatic breast cancer using the igf-1r inhibitor osi-906 and the egfr tki erlotinib , although results are not yet available ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct01205685 ) .\nsimilarly , an exploratory study to assess the modulation of biomarkers in hnscc patients treated preoperatively with cetuximab and/or imc - a12 , a humanized antiigf-1r monoclonal antibody is currently underway ( http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , identifier nct00617734 ) .\nthese studies will be critical for evaluating whether the use of antiigf-1r and egfr - targeted treatments will be more effective than single - agent modalities for treating patients with hnscc .\ntargeted therapies that block egfr , met , and igf-1r signaling in head and neck cancers continue to show promising results in preclinical studies and clinical trials .\nhowever , it is difficult to predict which patients are most likely to benefit from these therapeutics and potential side effects during long - term in vivo use . given the interplay between these rtk signaling pathways and the mediocre results obtained with monotherapy regimens thus far , clinical trials will be required to determine how egfr- , met- , and igf-1r - targeted therapies can be used in combination in order to definitively abrogate their common downstream oncogenic signaling networks .\nalthough gaps in our knowledge concerning the role of met and igf-1r in head and neck tumorigenesis , as well as acquired resistance to antiegfr therapies remain to be addressed , efforts to translate current information towards clinical applications continue to be impressive ."}

induced cell death through activation of enzymatic degradation , preservation of mitochondrial function , and inhibition of apoptotic cell death .\nclearly , mpp was found to significantly decrease the survival of dopaminergic neurons and increase the release of ldh into the culture medium .\nthe mpp toxicity involves its selective uptake by dopaminergic neurons through the dopamine transporter and inhibition of mitochondrial complex i activity with subsequent mitochondrial depolarization.14 in parallel , the use of jc-1 fluorescence dye in our current study showed that mpp significantly decreased the m of cultured cells as indicated by the decreasing red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 .\nsimilar mpp - induced reduction of m was reported in other in vitro disease models.15,16 mitochondrial damage has long been implicated in the death of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in both pd patients and experimental models.17,18 staining of primary dopaminergic cultures with blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain showed that a significant number of the cells displayed features of apoptosis , most notably chromatin condensation , and fragmentation .\npreviously , tang et al19 and xu et al16 demonstrated that mpp caused apoptotic cell death in pc12 and sh - sy5y cells .\nthe mpp - induced apoptosis was reported to occur as the result of disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and opening of the permeability transition pore.20 similar to our previous report,9 co - treatment of primary mesencephalic cell cultures with tq and mpp was found to protect dopaminergic neurons and decreased the release of ldh into the culture medium . since that time , no evidence in the literature has shown how tq protected dopaminergic neurons in the primary mesencephalic cell culture .\nstaining of cultures with lysotracker deep red showed that tq significantly increased the red fluorescence of the dye compared with mpp - treated cultures , indicating enhancement of the formation of many autophagolysosomes , the sites of lysosomal degradation , by tq .\nthis is supported by the findings of he and klionsky21 who correlated the fluorescent signals of lysotracker deep red to the upregulation of autophagy in zebrafish . increased red fluorescence of lysotracker deep red\nis attributed to the formation of many autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes that retain much dye as the result of increasing their acidification . using jc-1 fluorescent dye showed that tq significantly enhanced m as it increased the red : green fluorescence ratio of jc-1 compared with mpp - treated cultures .\nthe tq was similarly found to protect rat cortical neurons against ethanol- and a1 - 42-induced neurotoxicity through inhibition of mitochondrial membrane depolarization.22,23 counting of apoptotic nuclei using blue - fluorescent dapi nucleic acid stain indicated that tq decreased mpp - induced apoptotic cell death in primary mesencephalic cell cultures . in accordance ,\nullah et al22 reported that tq inhibited apoptotic cell death in ethanol - treated rat cortical neurons and attributed this effect of tq to the preservation of mitochondrial integrity .\nzhang et al24 reported that mitochondrial clearance protected cultured cortical neurons against ischemia - reperfusion - induced cell damage . in conclusion , correlating such results would therefore suggest that tq might activate a lysosomal degradative process in dopaminergic neurons , where clearance of damaged mitochondria results in reduced mitochondria - mediated apoptotic cell death .\nthis might raise the possibility of using tq as a potentially therapeutic intervention in pd patients .\nwhenever a manuscript contains material ( tables , figures , etc . ) which is protected by copyright ( previously published ) , it is the obligation of the author to obtain written permission from the holder of the copyright ( usually the publisher ) to reproduce the material in neurosciences .\nplease submit copies of the material from the source in which it was first published ."}

however , this observation was not statistically significant .\nthe mountain plot analysis reinforced that ef measured by ct correlated well with that measured by echo .\nmdct coronary angiography has emerged as a valuable technique for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients with low to intermediate pretest probability of ischemic heart disease . utilizing analytic software ,\ngated volumetric ct data can be processed to provide quantitative functional analysis of the lv in patients with coronary artery disease .\nwe were able to obtain satisfactory artifact free datasets from 113 consecutive subjects who underwent coronary cta .\nall of our patients were either known cases of coronary artery disease or had suggestive clinical symptoms .\npatients with pacemaker , ventricular septal defect were excluded from the study as successful segmentation of the lv blood pool was not possible . achieving a stable heart rate for\nthe examination was variable component of the examination . however , no examination had to be postponed or cancelled due to this limitation .\nour study using automated software showed a good interstudy correlation , with a correlation coefficient of 0.503 ( p < 0.001 ) .\nthe bland - altman plot revealed a slight mean difference between ef measurements on ct and echo with most differences falling within two sds of the mean .\nhence , we found that software is user - friendly and capable of providing good reproducibility for ef measurements in comparison with echo . in a previous study by krishnam et al .\n, similar results were recorded , though the number of subjects was small . in a study by cury et al . , a trend of mdct slightly underestimating lvef compared with tte was observed .\nwe observed a trend towards mdct resulting in slightly higher values for lvef when compared with echo , contrary to expected mild reduction in beta blocked patients .\ntrend however was not statistically significant , could be due to recognized limitation of evaluation technique leading to over or underestimation .\nmean difference in ef measurements between cta and echo is small ; although standard deviation of the mean difference is quite high , leading to wide limits of agreement .\npossibly observation results from the fact that the ef measurements from echo were obtained in a clinical setting , on visual estimation and calculation of ef using simpson 's method based on geometrical assumptions .\nour observations are in accordance with the previous studies of 64-slice coronary ct , confirming that lvef estimation is feasible with the mdct data and may be regarded as a useful clinical index , correlating with results of echo .\nthere are studies with semiautomated software for quantitative functional analysis of lv with user defined mitral valve plane and an arbitrary point within the lv , with the option to expand or reduce the area of segmentation .\nmany earlier studies have compared the use of 4- , 8- , and 16-slice ct scanners for evaluation of lv volumes .\nlarger detector configuration in 64-slice ct scanner , has the advantage of being faster , capable of smaller slice thickness and higher temporal resolution .\nrelatively higher radiation dose results from the protocol optimized for thin slice high - resolution imaging of the coronary arteries .\nthe ecg - dependent tube current modulation is currently the most effective tool for dose reduction and may reduce patient dose by up to 50% .\nit is important to note that two points of the cardiac cycle ( end - systole and end - diastole ) with modulation of tube current were not used in our study because ecg - gated dose modulation was only applicable to 50 - 90% of the rr interval on ecg .\nif the aim is to evaluate coronary arteries only , it is recommended to use an ecg - dependent dose modulation technique or newer prospective gated techniques .\nnew developments in mdct technology is allowing examination of patients with higher heart rates and reducing the dose of beta - blockers . presently , mdct examination is possible which contains all the phases with a considerably lower dose of the order of 2 - 3.3 msv .\nthe software identifies the lv blood pool based on hounsfield unit values and continuity of adjacent voxels . in patients with a ventricular septal defect\n, there is contrast opacification in both ventricles and a bridge of contrast through the septal defect .\ntherefore , the software identifies the right and lv blood pools as a single chamber , resulting in incorrect segmentation and thus inaccurate assessment of lv functional parameters . in patient with pacemakers\n, software identifies a pacemaker wire as high - density contrast and segments the pacing wire as part of the ventricle , resulting in failed segmentation . the version of the software used for this study it was not able to segment the myocardium in order to quantify the lv myocardial mass , which may be important in certain cardiac diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .\nit is important to note that cardiac mri is considered as a  gold standard for lv function assessment .\ncardiac mri ( cmri ) provides excellent temporal and spatial resolution , image acquisition in any desired plane , and a high degree of accuracy and reproducibility . concerning quantitative measurements\ncine mri technique is potentially the most comprehensive cardiac imaging modality available because of its excellent contrast between blood - filled ventricles and the surrounding myocardium .\nyamamuro et al . , have shown high linear correlation between ef measurements on ct and on mri .\nthe temporal resolution of many available mdct is still considerably lower than that of echo and cine mri .\nthis lower temporal resolution can make evaluation of isovolumetric ed and es phases of the cardiac cycle , and thus ef , less precise .\nthere is considerable improvement in temporal resolution of mdct with improvement in gantry rotation , multiple and partial segment processing techniques .\ntr of 80 - 250 ms has been achieved in state of the art units .\nthough it is short of fluoroscopic resolution , currently available options are more than sufficient for motion free systolic and diastolic cardiac imaging with heart rate below 100/min . additionally , the use of a b - blocker to reduce the heart rate to less than 65 bpm can influence the functional parameters that are to be measured . beta blocker do influence the lvef , lead to underestimation .\noverestimation or underestimation of the lv volume has been reported because of the different criteria for selecting the endocardial boundary or the inclusion / exclusion of papillary muscle .\nideally estimation of the real - ef from all 20 phases is more precise ; however , this significantly increases effort and processing time .\neffect of beta - blocker has to be factored in interpretation of ef by mdct .\nintroduction of new ct imaging methods , including dual source ct in clinical practice will overcome these two problems significantly owing to its two - fold increase in temporal resolution . also , newer options in mdct technology may partially obviate need for use of beta blockers .\nfunctional parameters derived from 2d - tte are compared with ct derived 3d volumetric data , which are not strictly comparable .\nour study design did not allow realistic comparison of mdct and echo lv volume data .\nit would be interesting to compare the same for assessment of accuracy of respective data .\nwith evolution of speckle - tracking 3d echography and new low radiation , high tr scanning such studies are possible .\nthe delay time between ct and echo and premedication with -blockers could have changed myocardial contraction and lv volumes as measured with the two methods . in the present\nset up , the number of patients referred to coronary angiography who will have volumetric data will be significantly smaller , limiting the application of this utility to a smaller offset of patients .\nthe radiation issue will certainly be an important consideration to use this technique in the larger group of patients .\nemerging new applications of echography in the form of 2d and 3d speckle - tracking echo certainly will have a greater role to play in the future noninvasive assessment of the myocardial function . in conclusion\nour study confirms useful complementary functional information in coronary cta datasets , using fully automated analysis software for rapid assessment of lvef .\nit is irrational to utilize mdct alone to assess lv function in clinical patients , given the radiation exposure involved .\nhowever , additional clinically useful information from a clinically indicated coronary ct examination with a lowest possible radiation dose is invaluable in patients known or suspected of ischemic heart disease .\nvalidating consistency of results with mri will further lend support to the use of mdct derived results .\ngoing forward with changing trends in ccta imaging , it is conceivable that number of patients undergoing cta with retrospective gating will substantially be reduced , thus limiting the functionality to a small group of patients ."}

guided fractionation of the identified plant may lead to standardized extract or isolated bioactive lead compounds as the new drug .\nthe whole plant of aristolochia bracteolata was extracted successively with meoh and subjected to liquid - liquid fractionation with n - hexane , chloroform , ethyl acetate , and n - butanol .\nthe resulting fractions were tested for antibacterial and antifungal activities . the crude extract and chloroform fraction were significantly active against sea urchin -

organism systems , including in particular toxicity studies and an examination of their effects on beneficial normal microbiota . in spite of\nthe fact that herbal remedy is a mixture of many chemicals in unknown doses and might result in unpleasant side effects , many people believe that treatments that are natural are somehow magically safe and effective . \n aristolochia is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases [ 13 , 15 ] , including those associated with bacteria .\nthis study showed clearly that the excellent effect of aristolochia in treating such diseases is due to the toxic compound aa-1 .\nalthough aa-1 is highly effective in killing m. catarrhalis , it is ineffective against the other microorganisms tested .\nthis highlights the importance of m. catarrhalis in discovering the cellular target of aa-1 and the mechanism of aa-1 toxicity .\nthe widespread use of aristolochia is not sufficient to ensure that it is effective or even that it is safe .\ntherefore , hit - to - lead exploration is necessary to identify related compounds with low toxicity , low cost , and improved potency that can replace the use of the harmful crude plant material .\nit is impossible to ban the use of these remedies , especially in the rural areas in sudan and other african countries ; therefore , we strongly recommend educating the public of the risks versus the benefits of aristolochia and gradually replacing them with either economical new drugs or standardized extracts and homogenous batches of other plant material with known levels of safe active constituents .\nusing bioassay - guided fractionation technique , the present study directly linked the antibacterial activity of aristolochia bracteolata to the aa-1 .\nalthough aa-1 had strong activity against m. catarrhalis , it had a narrow spectrum of activity than expected based on the activity of the crude extract from which it was isolated or from its traditional usage .\nthis may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or may be due to placebo effect ."}

no complications related to stent - graft deployment or recurrent infections have been encountered .\nher pr3-anca titer has normalized . a contrast - enhanced computed tomographic image after endovascular stent graft repair .\nin this case , an infected aortic aneurysm exhibited elevated the patient 's pr3-anca level , and its clinical course mimicked pr3-anca - associated vasculitis .\nthe detection of ancas is highly specific for a diagnosis of anca - associated vasculitis ( 4 ) ; however , a number of infections can result in a positive anca test .\nthere are several reports of infective endocarditis with the presence of ancas that mimic the clinical manifestations of an anca - associated vasculitis such as glomerulonephritis ( 2,3 ) . in the present case , based on the finding of positive blood cultures\n, we suspected that the patient was experiencing not anca - associated vasculitis but infective endocarditis .\nhowever , no vegetations were detected in the cardiac chambers using transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography .\ninstead , contrast - enhanced ct revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the descending aorta , which suggested that the patient had an infected aneurysm .\nher renal dysfunction and elevated pr3-anca levels normalized with clinical resolution of the infected aneurysm after the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and evar .\nthe patient has remained free of any evidence of systemic vasculitis during follow - up .\nthe presence of pr3-anca may have been falsely positive in the present patient . to our knowledge , this is the first report of an infected aortic aneurysm with a positive pr3-anca test and clinical features mimicking anca - associated vasculitis .\nthe presence of vegetations in the heart is one of the most characteristic findings of infective endocarditis .\nthese vegetations are composed of bacteria , platelets , and inflammatory cells interspersed with fibrin mesh , either on damaged endocardium , including native cardiac valves , or prosthetic valves ( 5 ) . in the present case ,\nbecause these masses disappeared after antibiotic treatment , they were considered to be vegetations . a pathological examination of the macular hemorrhages on the patient 's sole indicated not a cholesterol embolization but rather a janeway lesion , which was the consequence of septic embolic events .\nwe therefore suspected that these masses were not mobile plaques but bacterial vegetations . to our knowledge ,\nfew cases of infected native aortic aneurysm manifesting vegetations in the aneurysm have been reported ( 6 - 8 ) .\nseveral mechanisms have been proposed regarding how ancas are formed during the course of infection , such as autoantigen complementarity , molecular mimicry , epigenetics , neutrophil extracellular traps , and microbial - sensing proteins called toll - like receptors ( 9 ) . there may be a great degree of overlap in the clinical and laboratory manifestations between anca - associated vasculitis and anca - positive infected aortic aneurysm , potentially leading to a misdiagnosis .\nit is important to correctly diagnose these cases in order to avoid administering inappropriate therapy , such as immunosuppressive treatment , which might have life - threatening consequences in a patient with an infected aortic aneurysm .\npositive blood cultures and imaging findings , such as a pseudoaneurysm and/or vegetations in the aorta , suggest the presence of an infected aortic aneurysm . a combination of conventional surgical treatment with resection of the aneurysm , extensive local debridement , and revascularization by in situ reconstruction or extra - anatomic bypass may be the gold standard , but such a treatment strategy is accompanied by a high mortality and morbidity . in the present case ,\nit was recently reported that evar of an infected aortic aneurysm is feasible and , for most patients , a durable treatment option ( 10 ) .\ngiven that the continuous administration of antibiotics for the infected aneurysm should prevent a recurrence of local infection , we continued using antibiotics until the infection was controlled and carefully monitored the shape of the pseudoaneurysm on contrast - enhanced ct .\nwe were ready to perform an emergency surgical correction at any point during this patient 's treatment course . in conclusion\n, we herein reported an unusual case of infected descending aortic pseudoaneurysm with luminal pathognomonic oscillating vegetation and with serological findings and clinical features mimicking pr3-anca - associated vasculitis ."}

soluble vitamin with an unclear role in endometriosis .\nit is suggested that nuclear vitamin d receptors can have a regulatory role in inflammation and can be used as an index of cellular metabolic health . a study on vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism in endometriosis compared 132 infertile women with endometriosis with 132 fertile women , reporting no significant difference and suggesting that vitamin d receptor gene polymorphism does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis . in some studies ,\nhigher plasma levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 and higher intake of dairy foods was associated with lower risk of endometriosis .\nconversely , another study compared serum vitamin d levels of 87 women with endometriosis with 53 women without endometriosis ; the mean serum levels of 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 in women with and without endometriosis were 24.914.8 ng / ml and 20.411.8 , respectively ( p=0.05 ) and the study concluded that endometriosis is associated with higher serum levels of vitamin d .\na systematic review of 10 case - control studies and 1 cohort study on women s diet found that women with endometriosis had lower consumption of vegetables and omega-3 , and reported a significant association between diet and endometriosis .\nvitamin d binding protein ( dbp ) is a plasma glycoprotein that modulates immune and inflammatory responses and also controls transport of vitamin d metabolites and bone development . in a study\ncomparing 13 ectopic endometrial tissues and 6 normal endometrial tissues , vitamin d binding protein was significantly higher in the ectopic endometrial tissues ( p<0.05 ) .\na systematic review of research from 1946 to 2013 on vitamin d and endometriosis reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of vitamin d binding protein .\nanother study compared serum and peritoneal levels of dbp in 26 women with endometriosis and 17 women with other benign gynecological conditions and reported that women with endometriosis had higher serum levels of dbp than in the control group .\na study comparing urinary levels of dbp in 57 women with endometriosis with levels in 38 controls found that the urinary level of dbp was significantly higher in patients with endometriosis .\na study using a rat model of endometriosis reported that treatment with vitamin d3 produced fibrosis and apoptosis in the stroma of tissues with endometriosis . a study on induced endometriosis in adult balb female mice reported that administration of 100 g / kg / day elocalcitol ( a vitamin d receptor agonist ) for 3 weeks reduced total lesion weight . because a relationship between vitamin d and endometriosis has been suggested by multiple studies , and since there has been no randomized clinical trial on endometriosis and vitamin d treatment in women , we decided to explore this relationship . in the present study on endometriosis - related pain\n, we found no significant difference in results of vitamin d treatment vs. placebo at 24 weeks after surgical diagnosis and treatment .\nvitamin d is a fat - soluble vitamin mainly produced in the body from food and supplements and cutaneous sun exposure .\nvitamin d deficiency is defined as serum 1.25-dihydroxy vitamin d3 levels under 20 ng / ml .\nit is reported in 52% of black and hispanic adolescents in boston and in 48% of girls in maine , and it is seen in 40100% of elderly men and women in the usa and europe . a study in germany found that 57% of people\n1879 years old were vitamin d deficient . the prevalence of vitamin d deficiency was reported to be 90% in healthy subjects in delhi , india . in a systematic review of 195 studies in 44 countries found that 37.3% of studies found that the mean serum vitamin d levels were less than 20 ng / ml .\nthe prevalence in pregnant turkish women was 81.4% . in a study of high school students in iran ,\nthe serum mean vitamin d level was 14.79.4 ng / ml . in another study in university students in shiraz , iran , 51.2% of female students had low serum levels of vitamin d . because the incidence of vitamin d deficiency in iran is high and we did not check the serum vitamin d levels in samples before intervention , it is possible that this dose and duration of vitamin d prescription was beneficial only for treatment of vitamin d deficiency and not endometriosis . in 1072 women attending an infertility center ,\nan in vitro study compared the effect of vitamin d3 on 25 human endometriosis stromal cell cultures ( ovarian endometrioma ) with the effect of vitamin d3 on culture of 20 endometrial samples of non - endometriosis women ; vitamin d3 inhibited proliferation , invasion , and pro - inflammatory cytokine production in endometriosis and reduced production of interleukin 6 and other inflammatory cytokines that stimulate adhesion of endometrial cells to the peritoneal cavity . a study on in vitro effects of vitamin d3 on human endometriosis stromal cells found that vitamin d3 significantly reduced interleukin 1 and tumor necrotizing factor- inflammatory responses , and also reported fewer endometrial stromal cells and reduced dna synthesis .\nthe study found significantly lower serum vitamin d3 levels in severe endometriosis compared to normal controls and patients with mild endometriosis . a study in italy investigated the effect of vitamin d on primary dysmenorrhea .\nthe samples were 40 women aged 1840 years old with 4 consecutive painful periods in the past 6 months .\nthey measured the serum levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d with high - performance liquid chromatography .\nthen the women were randomized into a group of 20 women who received a single oral dose of 300 000 iu vitamin d ( cholecalciferol ) at 5 days before their next menstrual cycle and another group of 20 women received placebo .\nthere was a negative correlation between the baseline dysmenorrhea pain score and the level of 25 hydroxy vitamin d3 ( r=0.36 , p=0.2 ) .\nthe researchers found a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in the vitamin d group in comparison with the placebo group in the next 2 menstruations ( p<0.01 ) .\nthey suggested this significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in vitamin d prescription group was due to decreased levels of pro - inflammatory cytokines and decreased the biological activity of prostaglandins .\nthe samples were not assessed for existing endometriosis . because low levels of serum vitamin d are common in healthy italian pre - menopausal women , these results only show that vitamin d was effective in relieving dysmenorrhea at least for 2 months after treatment in women with or without endometriosis and also in women with or without vitamin d deficiency .\nthere may be a relationship between vitamin d and pathogenesis of endometriosis , but in our study vitamin d was not effective in treatment of endometriosis - related pain .\nlarger clinical trials are needed to determine the possible effects of vitamin d supplementation in endometriosis treatment .\nthe first limitation of this study is the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our country and worldwide , meaning that a high percentage of our samples may have had vitamin d deficiency , which may have affected the results of our research .\nfurther clinical trials are needed on the role of vitamin d treatment for endometriosis - related pain .\nfuture studies should assess the serum levels of vitamin d before enrolling study subjects , and those with vitamin d deficiency should be excluded .\nthe first limitation of this study is the high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in our country and worldwide , meaning that a high percentage of our samples may have had vitamin d deficiency , which may have affected the results of our research .\nfurther clinical trials are needed on the role of vitamin d treatment for endometriosis -

{"id": 23, "text": "it is generally accepted that microleakage between the filling materials and root canal \n walls might adversely affect the outcome of root canal treatment .\ntherefore , it is critical the complete \n sealing of the root canal system after cleaning and shaping in order to avoid the \n bacterial penetration and re -

percha in preventing microleakage based on the chemical tracer penetration \n analysis by sem and the use of epiphany primer does not reduce the microleakage of ah \n plus . nevertheless , other researches pointed out that the epiphany system provided the \n greatest resistance to the movement of fluids or dye leakage \n test , when compared to epoxy \n resin - based root canal sealers , but others have just indicated the opposite .\nthese apparent discrepancies can perhaps be explained by the \n methodology used and their variables .  \nthese results agree with those of previous studies in which , microleakage markers were \n used to evaluate apical sealing of the same endodontic sealers .\nthe tracer \n selected was agno3 , which may penetrate into dentinal tubules due to their \n physical and chemical characteristics including : concentration , smaller molecular size , \n its neutral ph , diffusion coefficient and service life up to 168 h post - preparation time of \n solution .\nanother reason for \n this choice is that metallic silver deposits may be observed by sem using back scattered \n electrons ( bse ) mode . on the other hand ,\nthe results of the current study disagree with the findings of \n shipper , et al .  \nan \n explanation for this would be that their studies have evaluated coronal and not apical \n bacterial leakage . indeed , coronal seal might be favorably influenced by photoactivation \n of the material which is unlikely to occur in the apical third .\nfurthermore , it is speculated that in in \n vivo studies ( dogs ) , the high release of calcium hydroxide ( 41.46 mg / l ) that \n would occur during the process of epiphany sealer solubilization , would make the medium \n alkaline , resulting in acceleration of the periapical tissue repair process .\nthis study has shown that the presence of apical gaps at the sealer / dentin or \n sealer / cone interfaces had an effect on apical microleakage .\nthe epiphany group \n presented more type 1 gaps than the other groups ( table \n 1 ) , rejecting the second null hypothesis .\nthese results corroborate with \n previous observation of gaps in the apical 4 mm of epiphany or ah plus - filled root \n canals .\nstress generated \n during the polymerization shrinkage of epiphany sealer has probably influenced the \n integrity loss at the sealer / dentin interface .\nin addition , the cavity configuration factor ( c - factor ) is \n highly unfavorable for adhesion inside root canals .\nmoreover , it is known that analysis of gap formation of \n vertically sectioned root filled teeth hides the risk of artifacts during sectioning . \n\ntherefore , in this study , the sections were made at low speed under water cooling .\nthe \n resin - epoxy replicas at the dentin / sealer and sealer / cone interfaces were made before \n the specimens had been prepared for sem examination in order to differentiate genuine \n gaps from artifactual gaps created after vacuum desiccation in conventional scanning \n electron microscopes .\nfew studies have focused on apical sealing from two separate perspectives , such as \n microleakage and apical gap formation .\nsem was used to evaluate these perspectives , but it was restricted to a descriptive \n approach .\na systematization of the observations , complemented by a statistical analysis , such as \n the one performed in this study , could provide greater methodological accuracy and \n impartiality for comparing the experimental groups .\nthe correspondence of analysis \n between the types of gaps and linear extent of agno3 leakage ( fig .\n3 ) confirms the effect of gaps on apical \n microleakage , expressed by the silver deposition into gaps that extended deeply inside \n dentinal tubules ( fig .\nregarding to statistical analysis , the ordinal logistic regression analysis model was \n used due to microleakage was considered categorized ordinal response variable ( ranging \n from 0 - no leakage to 5 - leakage up to the fifth millimeter ) .\nthe correspondence \n analysis is a method that leads to visualize the association between two categorical \n variables , in this case microleakage and the type of gap .\nthe generalized linear model \n with poisson which is an extension of usual regression model was performed to quantify \n the distribution of types of gaps .\nthis result could be explained by two hypotheses : ( 1 ) \n the low degree of conversion of the epiphany sealer and ( 2 ) the formation of hydrogel at the bond interface resulting \n from the incomplete evaporation of the epiphany primer solvent .\nthe second hypothesis could also explain the inefficacy \n of epiphany primer in improving the sealing capacity of ah plus .\nmoreover , there is a \n chemical incompatibility between these two materials , since the epoxy resin sealers do \n not copolymerize with methacrylate resin - based adhesives .\nother studies should be carried out to clarify the \n sealing ability of the root - filled materials studied .\nit may be concluded that none of the tested materials completely sealed the apical 5 mm . \n\nthe presence \n of gaps had an effect on apical microleakage for all materials . comparing the materials , \n epiphany system presented more regions containing gaps between the dentin and the sealer \n ( type 1 ) . in view of these findings ,\nclinically , it can be suggested that ah plus would \n provide a better apical seal .\nthis study was partially supported by capes ( coordenao de \n aperfeioamento de pessoal de nvel superior)/institutional \n qualification program ( pqi n : 0090/03 -

{"id": 26, "text": "according to the u.s . national institutes of health , up to 80% of human bacterial infections involve biofilm - associated microorganisms 1 . among these , implant - related infections\ndo still have a tremendous impact in orthopaedics and trauma 2 , with high social and economic costs 3 , 4 , posing challenging diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas 5 .\nin fact , peri - prosthetic joint infection ( pji ) remains one of the most feared complications in orthopaedic surgery and among the first reasons for implant failure 6 .\nmoreover , given the increasing number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed , the prevalence of this complication is rising , with increasing costs for national health systems and increasing biological costs for the patients , such as loss or reduced joint function and deterioration in their physical and psychological health 7 . according to the widely accepted model of the ' race for the surface ' for pji development ,\nhost and bacterial cells compete for surface colonization , with a low probability of bacterial attachment if host cells adhere to implant first , and vice versa . in the event of bacterial adhesion to an implant ,\nin addition , the matrix protects the biofilm cells from various microbicidal agents and stresses , including dehydration , toxins , ultraviolet light , chemical disinfectants , temperature and osmotic shock , and lead them to increased resistance against antimicrobials 9 , 10 . to address the limited efficacy of existing antibiotics in the treatment of established bacterial biofilms , novel approaches are required to prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation 11 .\nadhesion is a necessary first step in microbial colonization and pathogenesis and provides a good theoretical target for new preventive and treatment strategies 12 .\nbacterial adhesion to surfaces can be divided into a first , reversible phase and a second , irreversible phase .\nonce an implant is inserted into the body , it is covered by a conditional protein layer composed of host proteins , such as albumin and complement , that act as a reservoir of several receptors for bacterial adhesive ligands , mediating adhesion of free - floating bacteria to the surface of the biomaterials 14 , 15 ; these first adhesions are , however mechanically and biologically unstable .\nfew minutes after this first , reversible phase , bacterial clusters attached to the surface starts to express biofilm related genes , produce glycocalyx and form mature biofilm , thus transforming the adhesion from reversible to irreversible 16 .\nfull - formed biofilm can be found few hours after the first bacterial adhesion 17 .\nantimicrobial surface coatings can be based on an anti - adhesive principle that prevents bacteria to adhere and form biofilms 18 .\nin fact , some polymer coatings , like the hydrophilic polymethacrylic acid , polyethylene oxide or protein - resistant polyethylene glycol can be applied to the surface of titanium implants and result in significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion 19 - 22 .\nhydrophobic and superhydrophobic surface treatment technologies have also shown a great repellent antibacterial effect in preclinical studies 23 - 25 .\nhowever , clinical application of completely novel coating technologies and compounds , not otherwise previously tested in humans , appears particularly challenging 26 .\nbacterial colonization can also be blocked by an inhibitor interfering with ligand - receptor interaction for bacterial attachment .\none of these inhibitors could be hyaluronic acid ( ha ) , a glycosaminoglycan made up of glucuronic acid and n - acetylglucosamine disaccharide units .\nit is a uniform , linear and unbranched molecule , with highly variable length and molecular weight ( up to 106 da ) .\nit is abundant in skin ( up to 56% ) and in connective tissues , with a turnover ranging from several hours to a few days depending on tissues .\nhyaluronic acid constitutes one of the main components of extracellular matrices . because of its biological properties , ha has several clinical applications ( aesthetic surgery , dermatology , dentistry , orthopedics and opthalmology ) 27 .\nextensive studies on the chemical and physicochemical properties of ha and its physiological role in humans , together with its versatile properties , such as its biocompatibility , non - immunogenicity , biodegradability , and viscoelasticity , have proved that it is an ideal biomaterial for medical and pharmaceutical applications 28 , 29 . among its various properties ,\nseveral studies have recently shown the ability of ha to protect against various infectious agents 30 , depending on ha concentration and molecular weight 31 , 32 , while more recently ha interference on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation has been extensively investigated 33 .\ngiven its high biocompatibility and well known safety profile and the anti - adhesive capabilities , ha and its composites represent an attractive , non - antibiotic , option to mitigate the impact of biofilm - related infections in various clinical settings including implant - related infections . aim of this review is to provide an update of the current evidence concerning ha ability to reduce / prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation .\nnearly two decades ago , pavesio et al . 34 were probably the first to describe the ability of ha to resist bacterial adhesion , with particular reference to staphylococcus epidermidis , and its non - fouling properties 35 , proposing coated polymeric medical devices ( e.g. , intraocular lenses , stents and catheters ) to reduce implant - related infections .\nin particular , a hydrophilic ha overlayer , linked to the surface of polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses ( iols ) , was shown to be able to prevent fibroblasts adhesion and to greatly reduce staphyloccous epidermidis adhesion to the implant surface 36 .\nthe impact of slime dispersants and anti - adhesives on in vitro biofilm formation on iols was further investigated by kadry and co - workers 37 , using a staphyloccous epidermidis wild strain , isolated from a patient with endophtalmitis ; the authors reported the ability of hyaluronan to reduce bacterial adhesion to iols to 30% , compared with untreated control cells .\nthe authors suggested the use of adjuvant therapy such as dispersants or anti - adhesives , in addition to the antibiotics in irrigating solutions for bacterial ocular infections .\nmore recently , the in vitro antiadhesive and antibiofilm activity of hyaluronic acid towards bacterial species commonly isolated from respiratory infections was investigated by drago et al .\n33 . in this study , the interference exerted on bacterial adhesion was evaluated by using hep-2 cells , while the antibiofilm activity was assessed by means of spectrophotometry after incubation of biofilm with hyaluronic acid and staining with crystal violet .\nthe experimental findings clearly demonstrated how hyaluronic acid is able to interfere with bacterial adhesion to a cellular substrate in a concentration - dependent manner .\nmoreover , staphylococcus aureus biofilm was found to be more sensitive to the action of ha , compared to that produced by haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis . concerning more specifically the antimicrobial activity , ha\nhas also been shown to exert varied bacteriostatic , but not bactericidal , dose - dependent effects on different microorganisms in the planktonic phase 31 , 38 . in this\nregard , radaeva et al . reported the inhibiting activity of ha with respect to some pseudomonas species 39 , while ardizzoni and co - workers 30 investigated the effects of ha on 15 atcc bacterial strains , representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species .\ntheir results showed that different microbial species and , sometimes , different strains belonging to the same species , are differently affected by ha . in particular , staphylococci , enterococci , streptococcus mutans , two escherichia coli strains , pseudomonas aeruginosa , candida glabrata and c. parapsilosis displayed a ha dose - dependent growth inhibition , while no ha effects were detected in e. coli atcc 13768 and c. albicans and s. sanguinis was favoured by the highest ha dose . comparing the potential bacteriostatic effect of some of the most commonly used biomatrix materials ( collagen type i , hyaluronic acid , hydroxyapatite , polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid ) on the growth over the first 12h of exposure of some of the most common orthopaedic bacterial pathogens ( staphylococcus aureus , staphylococcus epidermidis , -hemolytic streptococcus , pseudomonas aeruginosa ) , carlson and co - workers 38 found that ha had the most significant bacteriostatic properties on the studied organisms .\n31 investigated the potential bacteriostatic effect of hyaluronic acid in different concentrations and molecular weight on oral and non - oral microorganisms ( staphylococcus aureus , propionibacterium acnes , actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , pavotella oris and porphyromonas gingivalis ) with potential application in dentistry surgery ; the results showed that different hyaluronan solutions exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains .\nthe authors concluded that the clinical application of hyaluronan in form of membranes , gels , or sponges during surgical therapy may reduce bacterial contamination of the surgical wound , thereby lessening the risk of postsurgical infection and promoting more predictable regeneration .\nconcerning possible orthopaedic applications , in 2004 harris and richards 40 showed the visualization and quantification of s. aureus adhering to a variety of different treated / coated titanium surfaces . in their study ,\ncoating titanium with sodium hyaluronate significantly decreased the density of s. aureus adhering to the surfaces and its potential use in osteosynthesis , orthopaedics or dental applications was suggested out . in a very recent review on polysaccharide - based coatings , that have been proposed over the last ten years to impede biofilm formation on material surfaces exposed to bacterial contamination ,\nhyaluronic acid was discussed as one of the most studied , with demonstrated non - fouling properties on glass surfaces 41 ; displaying hydrophilic characteristics ( contact angle of 22 ) , this coating was in fact reported to reduce adhesion of s. epidermidis and e. coli by several orders of magnitude compared to the unmodified glass slide .\nsimilarly , adhesion of s. aureus on ti foils functionalized with hyaluronic acid - catechol was lower than on pristine substrates .\nbased on ha antiadhesive properties , a novel ha - based hydrogel has been recently proposed , in order to protect implanted biomaterials in orthopaedics , trauma and dental surgery from bacterial colonization 42 ; this fast - resorbable hydrogel coating , composed of covalently linked hyaluronan and poly - d , l - lactide (  defensive antibacterial coating  , dac , novagenit srl , mezzolombardo , italy ) , has been found to have a synergistic antibiofilm activity with various antibacterials and able to be effectively manually spread onto the surface of various biomaterials commonly used in orthopaedics , trauma and dental surgery 43 ( fig .\n1 ) . the ability to completely cover even sand - blasted titanium surface and resist scraping has in fact been confirmed by scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) analysis ( cf .\nthis is an important requirement in order to reduce the exposed surface of a biomaterial , thus creating a uniform coating of the surface and leaving no pores or cracks that could eventually be colonized by planktonic bacteria . in unpublished experiments ( novagenit srl , data on file ) , in order to evaluate dac ability to prevent bacterial adhesion , 200 mg of hydrogel were homogenously spread on the surface of sterile titanium discs .\nhydrogel - coated substrates and uncoated substrates ( controls ) were then placed into sterile 6-wells polystyrene plates and overlaid with a standardized inoculum ( 10 cfu / ml ) of bacterial cells for 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes .\nthe remaining adhered cells were detached by adding a solution of 0.1% w / v dithiothreitol ( dtt ) ( sigma - aldrich , milan , italy ) to each well and stirring for 15 minutes at room temperature .\nthen , 100 l of each sample were plated onto tryptic soy agar ( tsa ; merck , darmstadt , germany ) and incubated at 37c for 24 hours for cfu counts .\nthe results showed that the adhesion density of s. aureus on titanium discs pre - treated with dac , was significantly lower than adhesion on untreated controls at each time point ( fig .\n2 ) . in particular , reductions of adhered bacteria equal to 86.8% , 80.4% ,\n74.6% and 66.7% vs untreated discs were observed after 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes of incubation , respectively , while an increase of adhesion density during time was observed for both control and pre - treated discs ( fig .\nfurther analyses were conducted to show the ability to dislodge previously adhered bacteria ; to this aim , titanium discs were placed into sterile 6-wells polystyrene plates and overlaid with a standardized inoculum ( 10 cfu / ml ) of bacterial cells in order to allow the adhesion of bacterial cells .\nafterwards , 200 mg of hydrogel were spread on the surface of contaminated titanium discs in order to remove previously adhered bacteria .\nnon - adherent bacteria were removed by rinsing with sterile saline , while the remaining adhered cells were detached by adding 0.1% dtt as previously described .\nthen , 100 l of each sample were plated onto tsa and incubated at 37c for 24 hours for cfu counts .\nthe results showed that dac hydrogel treatment of discs reduced the amount of adhered bacteria in respect to control discs after 15 , 30 , 60 and 120 minutes of 84.0% , 72.8% , 72.3% and 64.3% , respectively ( fig.4 ) .\nonce again , an increase of adhesion density during time was observed for both control and treated discs ( fig .\ndac hydrogel showed similar or superior in vitro activity , compared to various antibacterials and a synergistic activity when used in combination ( fig .\nwere grown on chrome - cobalt devices in 6-wells polystyrene plates containing tsb for 24 hours at 37c .\nthen , growth medium was removed together with non - adherent bacteria and new broth added .\nthe plates were incubated at 37c in ambient air , until a visible biofilm was obtained .\ngentamycin and vancomycin were tested at a final concentration of 20 mg / ml . similarly , when mixed with the hydrogel , 60 mg of gel powder were reconstituted with 1 ml of water for injections containing gentamicin or vancomycin at 20 mg / ml concentration .\namount of biofilm at each time was determined before hydrogel and antibiotic agents addition and after 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 and 48 hours of incubation by a spectrophotometric assay .\nin particular , at each time , broth was removed and biofilm stained with crystal violet .\nafter elution of the stain from implants with absolute ethanol , the amount of biofilm was quantified by reading optical density ( o.d . ) at a wavelength of 595 nm against blank ( consisting of ethanol ) .\namount of biofilm at each time was compared with that formed on the same type of implant before treatment .\neach assay was performed in duplicate and repeated for three times . at each time point , both for gentamycin and vancomycin showed only a partial inhibition of biofilm formation ( ca .\n40 - 50% for vancomycin ) , with minor difference between the two studied microorganisms . on the other side ,\n50% in comparison to the untreated controls , while a combination of the hydrogel with either antibacterial resulted in a larger reduction of biofilm formation ( approximately 75 to 80% in comparison with untreated controls ) .\nboth these experimental studies show the ability of the dac hydrogel to significantly reduce bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation of common bacterial pathogens , thus potentially providing an effective protection of the implant ; however , these data also point out how , in the clinical setting , in the absence of an adequate immune response from the host and/or of sufficient local levels of antibiotics , a passive antiadhesive coating 18 like ha can be overcome by the remaining bacteria in a time - dependent manner .\nfor this reason , any passive antiadhesive coating of implants 44 should probably better be seen as a tool to reduce and delay bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation to a variable degree , also depending on the local environment , the contaminating bacterial species and initial bacterial load ; this may still provide an additional advantage to the host 's cells to first colonize the implanted biomaterial and win the competition with the microorganisms that may eventually be present , thus contributing to reduce the occurrence of implant - related infections .\nseveral clinical local applications of ha to reduce the impact of biofilm - related infections have been reported , in different clinical settings , with favourable results and no adverse events .\n45 recently described topical administration of hyaluronic acid in children with recurrent or chronic middle ear inflammations and chronic adenoiditis . in this prospective , single - blind , randomised controlled study , otoscopy , tympanometry and pure - tone audiometry in children which received the daily topical administration of normal 0.9% sodium chloride saline solution ( control group ) or 9 mg of sodium hyaluronate in 3 ml of a 0.9% sodium saline solution was performed .\nthe final analysis was based on 116 children ( 49.1% boys ; mean age , 62.9  17.9 months ) : 58 in the control group and 58 in the study group . at the end of follow - up ,\nthe prevalence of patients with impaired otoscopy was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.024 ) compared to baseline but not in the control group . in comparison with baseline ,\nthe prevalence of patients with impaired tympanometry at the end of the follow - up period was significantly lower in the study group ( p value = 0.047 ) but not in the control group .\nthe reduction in the prevalence of patients with conductive hearing loss ( chl ) ( p value = 0.008 ) and those with moderate chl ( p value = 0.048 ) was significant in the study group , but not in the control group .\nthe mean auditory threshold had also significantly improved by the end of treatment in the study group ( p value = 0.004 ) but not in the control group .\nseveral studies have also reported the beneficial effect of topical ha in chronic urinary tract infections ( uti ) .\nin contrast to traditional antibiotic therapy , which aims at eradicating pathogens , treatment with ha targets bacterial adherence to the bladder mucosa with the presumption that a damaged glycosaminoglycan mucous layer facilitates bacterial adherence and therefore recurrent uti 46 . among others 47 , 48 ,\nlipovac and colleagues evaluated the efficacy of nine ha bladder instillations over 6 months in 20 women with a history of recurrent uti .\ntheir status was assessed prospectively but compared with a retrospective review of patients ' charts .\nthe number of infections per year per patient was significantly reduced ( from 4.990.92 to 0.560.82 , p>0.001 ) and the mean time to recurrence ( from 76.724.6 to 178.325.5 days , p>0.001 ) was prolonged significantly .\nnevertheless 65% of treated patients were free of recurrences until the end of study ( 47.6 weeks ) 49 .\nwere able to provide a higher level of evidence by reporting a prospective , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , in which a significant reduction of 77% ( p<0.0002 ) in the uti rate per patient per year versus placebo was observed at the end of the study .\nmoreover , mean time to uti recurrence was significantly prolonged ( 185.278.7 versus 52.733.4 days , p<0.001 ) after treatment compared with placebo .\noverall urinary symptoms and quality of life measured by questionnaires significantly improved compared with placebo 50 .\nvery recently a multicentre european study confirmed the efficacy of intravesical administration of combined hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulphate ( cs ) for the treatment of female recurrent urinary tract infections 51 .\na total of 276 adult women received intravesical administration of ha+cs or standard of care ( antimicrobial/ immunoactive prophylaxis/ probiotics / cranberry ) . at follow - up ,\n181 patients treated with ha+cs and 95 patients treated with standard of care from 7 centres were available .\nthe crude and adjusted ors ( 95% ci ) for bacteriologically confirmed recurrence within 12 months were 0.77 ( 0.46 to 1.28 ) and 0.51 ( 0.27 to 0.96 ) , respectively .\nstudies were also undertaken to determine the effect on clinical variables , sub - gingival bacteria and local immune response brought about by application of hyaluronan - containing gels in early wound healing after scaling and root planing ( srp ) in dentistry 52 , 53 . in the study reported from eick et al .\nthe exclusion criteria were : antibiotics intake in the 6 months before the study , periodontal treatment received during the previous year , pregnancy , nursing , smoking , chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis , and allergy to ingredients in the drug . in the test group ( n=17 ) , a 0.8% hyaluronan - containing gels ( ha ) was introduced into all periodontal pockets during srp and a 0.2% ha gel was applied by the patients onto the gingival margin twice daily during the following 2 weeks while the control group ( n=17 ) was treated with srp only ; no placebo was used . probing depth ( pd ) and clinical attachment level ( cal )\nwere recorded at baseline and after 3 and 6 months , and subgingival plaque and sulcus fluid samples were taken for microbiologic and biochemical analysis . in both groups , pd and cal\nthe changes in pd and the reduction of the number of pockets with pd5 mm were significantly higher in the test group after 3 ( p=0.014 and 0.021 ) and 6 ( p=0.046 and 0.045 ) months .\nsix months after srp , the counts of treponema denticola were significantly reduced in both groups ( both p=0.043 ) , as were those of campylobacter rectus in the test group only ( p=0.028 ) .\nalthough to date no surface modification has been reported to be able to fully prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation 55 , available data show that hyaluronic acid has a proven in vitro antiadhesive / antibiofilm effect against some of the most common pathogens and it has been used safely , alone or in combination with other polymers , with satisfactory results in different conditions associated with biofilm - related chronic infections .\nclinical data in various applications , including dentistry , urology , wound management , dermatology and orthopedics , allow to consider the potential use of ha as a protective coating barrier of implants particularly safe and feasible on a large scale basis .\nwhile antibacterial coatings to mitigate the occurrence of implant- and biofilm - related infections are regarded as one of the most needed technology , currently only few and insufficient options are available for clinical use in orthopedics and trauma surgery 18 .\nconsidering the pathogenesis of implant - related infections , any protection offered by a fully biocompatible antiadhesive barrier , like ha and some of its derivatives , could be extremely useful to reduce the tremendous burden of implant - related infections .\non the other hand , it should be noted that hyaluronic acid as a passive protective barrier has some limits . among others ,\nthe antiadhesive / antibiofilm effect is limited and may vary , depending on the type of the microorganism , the bacterial load , the local environment , etc .\n; moreover , ha protection may be neutralized by the possible ability of some bacteria to produce hyaluronidase , an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of hyaluronic acid 56 , while collagen and hyaluronan may even become possible ligands for microbial attachment in particular situations 57 , 58 .\nto overcome at least some of these limits , possible loading of hyaluronic - based hydrogels with antibiotics is technically feasible and has been proposed by different authors 59 - 62 , being a possible option for future developments and large scale clinical applications , provided that regulatory requirements can be met ."}

mdr strains isolated , the commonest mdr strains were detected from e. coli 79/250 ( 31.6% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 75/250 ( 30% ) .\nsimilarly , out of 90 gnb - xdr strains isolated , the commonest xdr strains were detected from pseudomonas aeruginosa 29/90 ( 32.2% ) , followed by klebsiella pneumoniae 25/90 ( 27.8% ) .\naly and balkhy reported that most prevalent mdro in their study was e. coli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae . in another study , carried out in a tertiary care hospital in riyadh\n, it has been reported that most frequent mdr pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa followed by e. coli .\nthe percentage of mdr e. coli strains was more than klebsiella pneumoniae and even pseudomonas aeruginosa in our study probably because a total number of e. coli strains isolated ( 261 ) were also higher .\nthe slightly increased incidence of drug resistant strains observed in our study may be because our hospital is a tertiary care center in a rural setup and patients from adjoining districts and even villages are admitted for treatment . before attending the hospital , most of the patients get different antibiotics from general practitioners or due to over - the - counter sell of antibiotics often in improper dose .\nthe limitation of this study is that this is a single center study for only three - month period in a tertiary care hospital in central india . to reflect the trend of infections caused by mdr and xdr strains of bacteria in the region , a multicenter study involving all types of healthcare setups for a minimum period of one year\nthere is paucity of data regarding mdros in health care setup not only in india but also worldwide .\nunless and until multidrug resistant organisms are detected and their incidence is known , the strategies for their control can not be adopted properly in healthcare setup . hence , detection , prevention of transmission of mdros by following infection control practices , antimicrobial surveillance , and stewardship are need of the hour .\nmisuse and overuse of antibiotics , over - the - counter selling of antibiotics without prescription to common people , must be stopped by strict implementations of rules and regulations .\nwe hereby conclude that early detection and close monitoring of mdr , xdr , or even pdr bacterial strains must be started by all clinical microbiology laboratories to reduce the menace of antimicrobial resistance which is now a global problem ."}
{"id": 28, "text": "ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder .\nthe abnormality leads to urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infection ( uti ) , which can cause irreversible damage to the kidney .\nthis abnormality can be suspected in the fetus by antenatal ultrasonography ( usg ) and confirmed by other x -

disease ( 2 ) .\nthe assessment of hrqol has been used as a measure complementary to bone mineral density to evaluate and monitor the burden of osteoporosis on a patient 's daily life ( 3 ) .\nthere are several instruments that can be used to assess the quality of life of individuals with osteoporosis , including the osteoporosis assessment questionnaire , the quality of life questionnaire for osteoporosis ( optqol ) , the osteoporosis quality of life questionnaire , and the questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis ( qualeffo ) ( 4 - 7 ) .\nthe qualeffo , a specific tool used to evaluate subjects with vertebral fractures and that includes questions on pain , physical functioning , social functioning , general health perception and mental functioning , has been shown to be repeatable and consistent ( 7 - 8 ) .\nvertebral fractures are the most frequent osteoporotic fractures , occurring in at least 30% of the elderly population ( 9 ) , and have important clinical implications ( 10 - 14 ) .\nthese fractures are associated with increased risks of new osteoporotic fractures and mortality , especially in older women ( 10 - 11 ) .\nonly one - third of vertebral fractures are symptomatic ; therefore , patients may be unaware of their presence .\nindeed , in studies based on the radiographic screening of populations , the incidence of all vertebral fractures has been estimated to be three times higher than the incidence of hip fractures , and only 30% of people with vertebral fractures were found to have received medical attention ( 12 ) . women with vertebral fractures can also experience decreased hrqol due to physical limitations and psychosocial disabilities ( 13 - 14 ) .\nsome studies have assessed the impact of vertebral fractures on hrqol in older women in many countries ( 15,16 ) , but few such epidemiological studies have been conducted in brazil .\nmoreover , most of the studies conducted in this country have been performed in

normal and obese , respectively , with no significant difference between the two groups ( p>0.05 ) .\na tendency of older age in the vertebral fracture group was observed ( p  =  0.057 ) .\nthe frequencies of hypertension ( p  =  0.224 ) , diabetes ( p  =  0.672 ) , hypothyroidism ( p  =  0.723 ) , and two or more concomitant diseases ( p  =  0.216 ) and the average number of medications used ( p  =  0.497 ) were comparable between the groups .\ninterestingly , the vertebral fracture group contained a higher frequency of women defined as chronic fallers than the no vertebral fracture group ( 64.7 vs. 32.1% , p  =  0.017 ) .\nas expected , the vertebral fracture group had a higher frequency of osteoporosis ( 73.2 vs. 51.1% , p  =  0.012 ) and a lower frequency of osteopenia ( 19.5 vs. 38.1% , p  =  0.027 ) than the no vertebral fracture group .\nthe results for each domain of the qualeffo and the total qualeffo score in both groups are shown in table 2 .\nthe total qualeffo score was lower in the vertebral fracture group than in the no vertebral fracture group [ 61.4 ( 15.4 ) vs. 67.1 ( 14.2 ) , p  =  0.031 ] .\nlikewise , the physical function domain score of the qualeffo was worse in the vertebral fracture group compared with the no vertebral fracture group [ 69.5 ( 20.1 ) vs. 77.3 ( 17.1 ) , p  =  0.018 ] .\nno difference was observed regarding the other qualeffo domains ( pain , social functioning , health perception , and mental functioning ) ( table 2 ) .\nthe total qualeffo score was inversely related to bmi ( rs  =  -0.21 ,\np  =  0.005 ) and weight ( rs  =  -0.22 , p  =  0.009 ) .\nthe total qualeffo score was worse in women classified as obese than in those classified as overweight or normal [ 61.7 ( 15.4 ) vs. 66.4 ( 13.8 ) vs. 70.8 ( 13.5 ) , respectively , p  =  0.008 ] .\na lower total qualeffo score was also observed in women with low physical activity than in those with moderate or high activity [ 51.8 ( 19.1 ) vs. 64.8 ( 14.3 ) vs. 70.3 ( 13.2 ) , respectively , p  =  0.010 ] ( table 3 ) .\nsimilarly , the physical function domain of the qualeffo was inversely related to the bmi ( rs  =  -0.24 , p  =  0.001 ) . in this domain , women classified as obese were found to have lower scores than women classified as overweight or normal [ 70.7 ( 19.3 ) vs. 76.1 ( 16.1 ) vs. 81.4 ( 17.4 ) , respectively , p  =  0.002 ] . finally , lower scores for the physical function domain were found among women with low physical activity compared with those with moderate or high activity [ 49.6(24.9 ) vs. 75.1(18.1 ) vs. 80.7(12.6 ) , respectively , p  =  0.002 ] ( table 3 ) . a generalized linear model with gamma distributions and logarithmic link functions was developed to identify patient characteristics that were related to the total and physical function domain scores of the qualeffo .\nvariables with a p<0.10 in the univariate analysis ( age , bmi classification , physical activity , diabetes , presence of at least one fracture ) were included as independent variables .\nthe presence of obesity was negatively associated with the total qualeffo score ( p  =  0.001 ) .\na high physical activity level was positively associated with the total qualeffo score ( p  =  0.001 ) .\nthe presence of at least one fracture was associated with a worse total qualeffo score , independent of age , bmi classification and physical activity level ( p  =  0.030 ) .\nlikewise , the presence of at least one fracture was negatively associated with the physical function domain , independent of these same variables ( p  =  0.041 ) ( table 4 ) .\nthis study was the first study conducted in brazil that specifically assessed the impact of vertebral fractures on the quality of life in older , community - dwelling women using a specific questionnaire . in this study\n, we demonstrated that the presence of vertebral fractures in this population is related to worse hrqol , particularly with respect to physical functioning .\nthe major advantage of the present study is the homogenous selection of community - dwelling women , unlike previous studies in which individuals were recruited from clinics or from populations included in clinical trials .\nstudies showing worse hrqol in patients with vertebral fractures have been published in several countries ( 15,16 ) .\nthere are only two studies evaluating the hrqol in patients with vertebral fractures in brazil , but neither was specific to older community - dwelling individuals ( 17,18 ) .\nthe first of these two other studies was performed in 55 outpatient women divided into three groups : 1- women without osteoporosis , 2- women without osteoporosis and no vertebral fractures , 3- women with osteoporosis and vertebral fractures . in that study ,\nthe quality of life was assessed with the sf-36 , and no difference was found among the three groups .\none of the reasons for this finding was the inclusion of only women who were able to perform the spirometric tests , resulting in the exclusion of women in worse conditions who would most likely belong to the fracture group ( 17 ) .\nlater , de oliveira et al . evaluated the quality of life in ambulatory women with osteoporosis and found similar results for those who had vertebral fractures and those who did not .\nhowever , that study was not designed to assess the impact of vertebral fractures on quality of life , and the number of women with fractures was too small to enable an accurate assessment ( 18 ) .\nthe assessment of quality of life in relation to the qualeffo pain domain was similar in women with and without vertebral fractures in our study .\nsome studies have found that the pain domain is worse in women with fractures ; however , the patients included in those studies were recruited based on clinical symptoms related to fractures and were compared with those without back pain ( 28 ) .\nvertebral fractures do not always manifest with symptoms and are often diagnosed based on radiographs taken for other reasons .\nevaluated the chest radiographs of older women who had been hospitalized for several causes , and they found that only a few of the vertebral fractures present had been previously identified by clinicians ( 29 ) .\nindeed , in our previous study performed in brazil , 29.4% subjects had vertebral fractures , and none of these patients had prior knowledge of their vertebral fractures ( 9 ) .\nas observed in other studies , the mental function , social function , and health perception domains were not significantly different between women with and without fractures ( 30 ) .\nthe relatively small differences between the groups with and without fractures may be the result of the acceptance of poor health conditions due to the natural expectation of physical decline in older women ( 13 ) . in our study\n, we found that obesity and low physical activity were associated with lower quality of life .\nother authors have reported that higher bmi and a sedentary lifestyle are factors that influence the quality of life in patients with osteoporosis ( 18,31 - 32 ) .\nit is important to highlight the fact that both obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are preventable factors and can be controlled by a change in lifestyle .\nsome authors observed that physical exercise is associated with a better quality of life ( 33 ) and have demonstrated that a home exercise program for women with vertebral fractures ( 60 min / d , 3x / week for 12 months ) significantly improves the hrqol ( 34 ) . a study performed at our institution in osteoporosis patients showed that an exercise program improved the quality of life in these women ( 35 ) .\ntherefore , our data reinforce the need for all older women to be advised about the benefits of exercise .\nthese women should be encouraged to exercise regularly to reduce their bmi and improve their general welfare .\nour study is the first in brazil to conduct a thorough assessment of the relationship between quality of life and vertebral fractures .\nan important characteristic of this study was the use of standardized and reliable instruments for both the vertebral fracture assessment ( genant semi - quantitative method ) and the hrqol assessment ( qualeffo ) .\nalthough the qualeffo has not been validated in brazil , which is a limitation of the present study , this tool is the most frequently used for assessing quality of life in osteoporosis and was recommended for the investigation of vertebral fracture subjects in multicentric studies that included centers in brazil ( 36 ) .\nthis questionnaire is more sensitive in detecting differences between groups , and it provides a better discrimination between individuals with and without vertebral fractures compared with generic hrqol instruments , such as the sf-36 , particularly with respect to physical functioning , which is significantly affected in these patients ( 8) . in conclusion , this study demonstrated the negative impact of vertebral fractures on the quality of life in older women , independent of other factors such as bmi and physical activity .\nalthough the clinical relevance of vertebral fractures is well established , these results are important for assessing the burden of this disease and reinforce the need to reduce the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these fractures . the results of this study also highlight the need for awareness of the importance of maintaining proper weight and promoting changes in lifestyle through physical activity and dietary control .\nthis study was supported by fundao de amparo e pesquisa do estado de so paulo ( fapesp ) # 03/09313 - 0 ; conselho nacional de cincia e tecnologia ( cnpq ) # 305691/2006 - 6 ( rmrp

{"id": 30, "text": "the majority of women with menorrhagia , postcoital bleeding , intermenstrual bleeding , or postmenopausal bleeding ultimately undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling as part of their assessment , particularly if symptoms persist or pelvic imaging suggests a uterine abnormality .\ndilatation and curettage ( d&c ) has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological evaluation\n. however , the needs for admission and general anesthesia and their associated costs have made this option less favorable . in the outpatient setting , endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological assessment [ 3 , 4 ] .\ninadequate sampling is more problematic in postmenopausal women , for whom up to 68% of endometrial samples are reported to be inadequate . in our institution , the only sampling tool available to perform the outpatient sampling procedure is the uterine explora model i - mx120 ( http://www.coopersurgical.com/ ) ( figure 1 ) .\nin addition , the device is sterile and disposable ( one - time use ) .\nthe advantages of using explora rather than d&c as a sampling device include a reduction in hospitalization costs , extra convenience for the patient and physician , and the minimal complications of the procedure .\nthe purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses .\nafter obtaining the approval of our institutional review board , all endometrial samples received at the histopathology department in king khalid university hospital ( kkuh , riyadh , ksa ) between january 2007 and december 2010 were included in this study . a total of 1270 endometrial samples were included ( table 1 ) .\ntwo hundred seventy - four samples ( 21.6% ) were obtained by conventional d&c in the surgical theater , while the remaining 996 samples ( 78.4% ) were obtained by senior obstetrics and gynecology residents who used a standardized biopsy technique in the outpatient procedure rooms . during the usage of the explora model\ni , the syringe provided with the instrument was used to create a negative pressure , and the explora was rotated as it was withdrawn . after withdrawal , the tip was cut off , and the tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin saline fixative and was sent for pathological examination .\nthe pathologists who interpreted the endometrial samples were blinded to the instrument or method used to obtain the samples .\nan inadequate sample was defined as consisting of only blood , cervical mucus , endocervical epithelium , or blood with fragments of endometrial glands or stroma insufficient for histopathological assessment and diagnosis .\nthe age , gravidity , parity , menstrual history , uterine size , hysteroscopy findings ( when available ) , and the presence or absence of any cervical abnormality were recorded on the request forms , which were reviewed by the investigators . for each of the two methods used ( explora model i and d&c ) , the numbers and percentages of inadequate samples and age group clustering were calculated and statistically analyzed .\nof the 1270 endometrial samples obtained , 253 samples ( 19.9% ) were scored as inadequate . of these samples ,\nthe explora sampler was used to collect 224 samples ( 88.5% ) , whereas 29 samples ( 11.5% ) were obtained by d&c ( figure 2 ) .\nthus , the insufficient tissue percentage was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with d&c ( 2.2% ) , which was a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0001 )\n. age group clustering ( i.e. , numbers of premenopausal and postmenopausal women ) of inadequate sample results was also calculated ( figure 3 ) . of the 253 inadequate samples ,\n82.6% were from women 45 years of age and older ( i.e. , postmenopausal ) compared to 17.4% in premenopausal women ; the age difference was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) .\nthe detection rates of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma using both methods were assessed and calculated .\nof the 73 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia , 50 ( 68.5% ) were diagnosed by d&c , and 23 ( 31.5% ) were diagnosed using the explora sampler .\nhowever , of the 18 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer , the rates of detection were similar between the two methods .\nendometrial sampling for the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma and other indications remains one of the most commonly performed gynecological procedures [ 14 ] . in recent years\n, less hazardous and more inexpensive and convenient outpatient sampling methods have replaced the traditional , in - hospital , endometrial curettage .\nthe advantages of outpatient endometrial biopsy include reduced cost and less risk for the patient , as no anesthesia is required .\nfurthermore , the discomfort and pain produced by sampling have been reported to be minimal .\nhowever , it is essential to ensure that outpatient endometrial sampling is quantitatively adequate and comparably accurate to conventional dilatation and curettage .\na sample is judged as adequate if a specific diagnosis can be given from the histological examination of the endometrial fragments obtained .\nadequacy can be measured by comparison of either outpatient biopsy with curettage histological evaluation or outpatient biopsy with the results of pathological examination of hysterectomy specimens [ 3 , 4 ] .\nmany techniques for obtaining an endometrial sample without the need for curettage have been described in the literature .\nchicago , il , usa ) and the novak biopsy curette with a 10  ml syringe functioning as an aspiratory device , which have been shown to be equally effective compared to d&c in detecting an endometrial pathology [ 69 ] .\nhowever , the vabra aspirator and novak biopsy curette , although widely available and relatively inexpensive , have several disadvantages , including the need for an electric vacuum pump to perform the aspiration in the former technique and the pain caused by both methods . as a result of these drawbacks , smaller inexpensive and\nself - contained instruments have been developed and the prototype of this class of endometrial samplers is the pipelle . the pipelle has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of vabra aspiration and the novak curettage while causing less pain [ 911 ] .\nall of these instruments ( i.e. , the vabra aspirator , the novak biopsy curette , and the pipelle ) have low rates of false - negative and insufficient tissue results for the detection of endometrial abnormalities , as determined by comparison to hysterectomy specimens [ 1113 ] .\nit was found that pipelle biopsy had a sensitivity of 99.2% in pinpointing high grade cancer and a sensitivity of 93% in detecting low grade malignancies ; the sensitivities defined for d&c were 100% and 97% , respectively . while \nexcellent agreement  was generally noted between preoperative histology and grade and the final pathology , pre - operative endometrial sampling more commonly provided underestimates of final grade ( low grade versus high grade ) than overestimates .\nthe explora is somewhat similar in its design to the pipelle , but clinical studies on its effectiveness are scarce , with the effectiveness ranging between 14.6 and 15% according to various studies [ 6 , 15 ] .\nour own findings revealed that the rate of obtaining inadequate samples using the explora was much higher ( 17.6% ) than the rates reported in the literature .\nhowever , most of these cases ( 82.6% ) were obtained from postmenopausal women with atrophic endometrial status .\nthis finding is in keeping with the rates reported by other investigators [ 58 , 16 ] .\nthis retrospective study suggests that traditional d&c produces better endometrial sample adequacy than the explora technique .\nthis finding indicates that clinicians performing endometrial sampling would benefit from more experience and training using the explora technique .\nadditional studies comparing the adequacy of samples obtained with different endometrial sampling techniques and devices are warranted .\nfurthermore , we recommend using the d&c procedure when the explora - obtained samples are inconclusive or when the use of the explora sampler is accompanied by ultrasound findings that are suspicious of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma ."}

95% ci , 1.72728.667 ; p = 0.006 ) was the risk factor for functional lesions .\nas outlined above , incidental adrenal enlargement is detected with increasing frequency , most likely due to widespread increase in cross - sectional imaging , and is gradually emerging as a common clinical problem .\nour study shows that the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement has gradually increased by year .\nmean age at diagnosis was 50.32 years , which is in line with other incidentally detected adrenal findings , namely , adrenal incidentaloma .\nthe increasing age of the general population and a research trend towards more advanced investigations in the elderly population may be contributing to the high detection rate in this age group .\nour results indicate that , for the elderly patients , it is essential to place emphasis on these incidental findings .\n's study   indicated that , of the total 64 patients , of which 40 ( 63% ) were men and 24 ( 37% ) were women , 43 ( 67% ) cases were bilateral enlargement and 21 ( 33% ) cases were unilateral .\nin addition , smooth enlargement was more common , in 53 ( 83% ) cases , and together these statistics reflect the likelihood that adrenal enlargement will be bilateral , smooth , and found in men .\nhowever , our study did not show this tendency , likely because the research goals and thus , study populations , differed between the 2 studies .\n's study aimed to explore prevalence , while the present study aimed to evaluate functional status .\nin addition , patients enrolled in our study were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology . it should be noted that admitting was more or less selective , especially in tertiary referral hospitals , and that economic considerations in parts of china were still a problem .\nclinically , upon discovery of incidental adrenal enlargement , 2 issues arise : functionality and malignancy . in the relevant literature [ 48 ] , adrenal enlargement can result from endocrine disorders , such as adrenocorticotropic hormone- ( acth- ) dependent or independent cushing syndrome , pa , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men-1 ) , and congenital adrenal hyperplasia .\nother potential causes include nonfunctional lesions , defined as a radiographic adrenal enlargement without clinical or biochemical manifestations , inflammation , neoplastic processes , obesity , or depression .\n12 patients were found to have subclinical cushing syndrome ( originated from the adrenal gland ) and 6 patients were diagnosed with pa . however , the variety of disease spectrum in the study was only moderate , perhaps due , in part , to the limited number of included cases .\nit is important to note that even though reported prevalence was up to 11.3% , patient referrals to endocrinologists are relatively rare .\nthis is likely related to the poor radiological awareness of this issue and its potential clinical significance .\nthe clinical significance of lesion location and patient gender is smaller . in the present study ,\nacth - independent macronodular hyperplasia ( aimah ) and primary pigmented nodular adrenal hyperplasia often manifest as adrenal hyperplasia . the clinical features of aimah tended to be atypical .\nnodules usually distorted and completely obscured the normal adrenal glands and were characteristically  ginger - like  .\nas for pa , adrenal glands affected by idiopathic hyperaldosteronism ( iha ) may be normal on the ct scan or show nodular changes , and small aldosterone producing adenoma ( apas ) may be interpreted incorrectly by the radiologists as \niha  on the basis of ct findings of bilateral nodularity or normal - appearing adrenal glands [ 1013 ] .\nthus , it is a simple matter to explain why nodular enlargement could be a predictive factor of functional lesions .\nmeanwhile , this also suggests that if incidentally detected lesions were nodular enlargements , evaluating its functional status should be a priority .\nin addition , the present study suggests that lesions on the left side were likely to be nonfunctional .\nin addition , there was only one patient with malignant lesion in the present study , and thus we were unable to analyze incidence of malignancy .\nincidental adrenal enlargement is a frequent radiographic finding and it is accompanied by diverse clinical factors that require proper diagnostic evaluation and management . in functional evaluation ,"}

medical specialists who do not have enough information about daily health affairs , and this lack is more remarkable in countries that welcome immigrants .\nimmigrants often have significant language and health literacy difficulties , which are further exacerbated by cultural barriers .\nalongside with sophisticated methods like computer and internet , using simple methods help us bring to achieve our health goals[68 ] . also , the lack of health literacy needs more attention when it is manifested in caregivers .\nit is believed that some of the undesirable health outcomes in children are because of inadequate health knowledge among caregivers . in the usa ,\ntherefore researchers have considered different methods to come up with this deficiency by having children to cooperate in their health programs .\na research group in india endeavored to transfer knowledge on leprosy in cooperation with children and informed their parents through them .\njacob et al ( 1994 ) started conducting a similar research that yields promising results .\nrimal and flora ( 1998 ) express that parental dietary behavior is partially affected by children .\nthe findings from studies in this field have encouraged other experts to apply similar methods to conduct their research projects , allahverdipour and bashirian , onyango - ouma and mwangagain from the influence of children in order to teach different parts of their society[1316 ] . despite the researcher 's trends in using novel methods in this field ,\nnone of them have used childish poem as a medium for knowledge transferring . in this study\n, we try to raise families health knowledge about infectious diseases by a method that uses children as health agents .\ninfectious diseases are still the leading cause of mortality in children less than 60 months in developing countries .\njuvenile age is accompanied by learning childish poems , which can be sung contnuously at home and potentially become as part of both children 's and parents memories .\nwe decided to transfer health knowledge to families through altering this information to childish poems and teaching children at kindergartens . in this method\nthe outcome of transferring health knowledge through childish poems has been assessed in this study .\nin this study , we use the method of interventional pre and post series to conduct our research .\nthe proposal of this non - invasive project was approved by the research committee of hamadan medical university in january 2009 .\nit was also accepted by hamadan welfare organization , which is the responsible organization of kindergartens in hamadan .\nour methodology is briefly explained as follows . at first , a sub specialist in pediatric infectious diseases provides seven short texts about health and common pediatric infectious diseases prevention .\nthen , a poet transfers these conceptions to childish poems for the first time ( appendix 1&2 ) . in the process of preparing an accurate questionnaire , at first 30 questions with three choices of \n,  false  and  do not know  were made , but 24 items of those are confirmed as valid questions by two experts of health education and infectious diseases . to assess\nthe reliability of the questionnaire a pilot study on a 40 participant sample was performed and cronbach 's alpha of the questionnaire was determined as 83 percent .\nin addition , we defined knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - tests . among 35 kindergartens in hamadan , we selected 7 kindergartens by simple random method .\nthe parents ( either father or mother , the one who is responsible to take her / his child ) of all five to six year old children of the selected kindergartens are asked to participate in the survey and a verbal consent is obtained from those who accepted .\nwe excluded the following children from our sample : those whose parents are physicians , nurses , health - care workers , and those children whose parents work at the kindergarten ( exclusion criteria ) .\nwe asked the parents of the sample survey to participate in a pretest by answering to a questionnaire when they are in the kindergartens .\nalso , they were asked to come to the kindergartens personally one more time when it is required ( to answer to the post test ) . then , we asked our kindergarten tutors to teach children seven musical poems about hydatid cyst , antibiotic misuse , botulinum toxin in home - canned foods , dysentery , the importance of sixth tooth , brucellosis and tetanus . in this step , children were not allowed to take home these texts , but they were asked to sing the poems at home and want their parents to re - write the poems on a paper and give them the papers to take to the kindergarten .\nthe teaching stage took between three to four months . during the next stage , parents took a post - test survey with the same 24 questions .\nparents of 115 kids participated in the pre - test and 103 of them completed the post - test .\nstatistical analysis is done on 103 who completed both tests by paired t - test .\nthe sample data consists of 103 parents who provided solutions to both the pre- and post - test question survey . of the participants 77 were female and 26 male . from the level of education point of view\n, 19 were below high school diploma , 45 had high school diploma , 8 had associate degree , 27 had ba , 3 had ma , and 1 had phd .\nthe results of the survey show a significant difference between the correct answers in both pre - test and post - test stages ( fig .\n1 ) . the frequency of correct answers to the tests \n table 1 shows the mean of the correct answers in the pre - test stage is 59.22 while the same figure for the post - test step is 81 ( p < 0.001 ) .\nin addition , we define knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - test stages . the mean km shows a significant increase ( 5.01 ) from 13.62 in the pre - test to 18.63 in the post - test ( table 2 ) . \n \nmean percent of correct answers to pre - test and post - test categories \n  analyzed by paired t - test sd : standard deviation mean of knowledge mark in pre - test and post test analysed by paired t - test the difference of km promotion among females and males was not significant ( 21.6120.17 in males and 20.331.61 in females , p=0.8 ) . the km was increased to 19.9325.06 among parents who at most had high school diploma and 23.4720.84 among parents with upper educational levels ( p=0.5 ) .\nhealth has been the concern of poets such as fiona sampson for years , however , these poems never had educational purposes . the results of this study\nconfirm our hypothesis about the role of children in raising family 's knowledge on health .\nthe results show that neither gender nor the grade of knowledge degree ( below and upper high school diploma or below and upper ba ) affect answers .\ntherefore , people with different educational status have received the information similarly implying that this method can be extended to general cases in a straightforward manner . \n\n1 shows that the percentage of correct answers has increased in 23 out of 24 questions .\nthe percent - age of correct answer to post - test has decreased only in one item ( item 11 ) which compares the risk of brucellosis transmission via unpasteurized milk and yogurt . although the term yogurt has not been mentioned directly in the related poem , but there is a hint about boiling mechanism and we expect that the audience discover the answer by logical thinking about the necessitation of boiling milk for preparing yogurt .\nthe decrease in answering is 2 percent which is not significant ; however , it shows that it would be better to mention the conceptions directly in these types of poems in order to avoid any misconceptions .\nmoreover , the percentage of correct answers to the questions of selected topics in pre - test and post - test has been compared ( table 1 ) and shows that parents have done better in post - test about all topics except one .\nthe difference of correct answers to the questions about brucellosis does not show a significant increase in post - test .\nthis finding is probably due to higher basic knowledge about brucellosis among parents . in other words , parents have had acceptable information about brucellosis even without our educational program , so we observe lower contrast between pre - test and post - test about brucellosis\n. it should be taken into consideration that brucellosis is an endemic disease in hamadan and people have been educated in different ways about this disease in recent years . although the lowest contrast between pre - test and post - test correct answers belongs to a question about botulism , the overall assessment shows that parent 's knowledge about this topic has been promoted significantly ( p<0.001 , table 1 ) . the significant difference between the pre - test and post - test km , based on the results of table 2 , is the sign of successful knowledge transfer through childish poems .\nthe researcher 's method is impressively successful ; however , the fact that he mentions that some mothers can not distinguish the semantic difference between information and advice , needs serious attention .\nin addition , since daughters may misunderstand the information , it would be probable to transfer the misconceived information to their mothers and this fact threats the successfulness of study in applying . while , in our study ; firstly , childish poems do not imply sententious , secondly , if the poem is sung wrong , the disturbance in rhythm will be appeared , so the information which is transferred through poems is not at risk of alteration . in evans research ,\nparents get familiar with educated topics with the help of their children in homework assignments designed for asthma management , and are taught about asthma indirectly .\nthe advantage of our study in comparison with evans is that in evans method knowledge transfer brings to bear via homework assignment , while in our study there is no obligation for doing home works , and parents are educated while enjoying their child 's singing . on account of the fact that making communication with younger children is not as difficult as with adolescents for parents , we are sure that knowledge transfers within a family through a continuous and friendly communication will work .\nchristensen expressed the importance of children 's role in promoting the family health status . in his article , he emphasized on the activities that children can perform to enhance their health and promote their family health situation via the health efforts for themselves .\nwe showed that children , additionally to what christensen mentioned , are able to affect their family 's health status directly . they can improve their family 's health as little teachers in health .\nit should be taken into consideration that the limitations of this study was the impact of other media on participant 's knowledge , which was not preventable .\none of the acceptable results of this survey was publishing the poems as a book for children which was republished and welcomed by public .\nthis study 's results suggest that health knowledge transfer to families through childish poems is an applicable method that has many advantages . by applying this joyful , cost - effective and easy - to - use method\nhowever , it should be taken into consideration that this method is applicable for families with trainable children , for teaching in larger scales more general ways should be added to this method .\nmoreover , the simplicity of poems and expressing the topics in a less elaborative form are the key factors that affect the successfulness of this way ."}

{"id": 36, "text": "ribonucleotide reductase ( rr ) inhibitors have been studied as radiation sensitizers for over 30  years in both the lab and the clinic .\nthe first of these , hydroxyurea , has been studied in both cervical and head and neck cancers , among others .\nalthough initially promising , many of the clinical trials produced negative results , or those that were difficult to interpret . there has recently been a significant advance in our understanding of this pathway from a number of well - done pre - clinical studies .\nin addition , the discovery of new rr inhibitors with increased potency and improved binding characteristics has produced a significant increase in interest in this area .\nthis review will synthesize the data detailing the response of rr to ionizing radiation ( ir ) and will provide a perspective on the use of rr inhibitors as radiosensitizers in the treatment of human cancers . over the years , many groups have explored the use of rr inhibitors as chemotherapeutics in their own right , or as adjuncts to dna damaging molecules , particularly in hematologic malignancies . while this area looks promising , this subject will not be reviewed here .\nribonucleotide reductase is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis and repair of dna and is the only enzyme responsible for the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates , the fundamental building blocks of dna synthesis and repair .\nr1 ( also called rrm1 or m1 ) is the larger , regulatory subunit that is constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle .\nit binds allosteric modulators , ribonucleoside diphosphates , and the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and fludarabine .\nthere are currently two known smaller subunits that bind r1 to form the active enzyme ; r2 ( also called rrm2 or m2 ) and a more recently discovered p53 inducible homolog of the r2 subunit , known as p53r2 .\nboth contain a tyrosine free radical stabilized by a non - heme iron complex that is critical in the reduction of ribonucleotides .\nr2 is known to be cell cycle regulated , with the highest levels during s phase , however the precise roles of the r2 and p53r2 subunit in the response to ir are an area of active debate , as outlined below ( figure 1 ) .\ngiven the pivotal role of rr in dna synthesis and repair , many studies have investigated the effect of dna damaging agents , including ir , on rr and its subunits .\neven so , there is currently still a great deal of controversy surrounding the exact mechanism of rr response to ir .\nthe first is that the small subunit r2 is up - regulated and provides dntps for dna repair in addition to its usual role in dna synthesis during s phase .\nthis is supported by a number of studies , including one by kuo et al . , who characterized the response of rr in the human cervical cancer cell line , caski .\nthey demonstrated an increase in r2 protein levels after treating cells with ir , which was correlated with an increase in rr activity .\nhowever , there was no increase in the transcription of r2 , implying that the protein increase was due to post - transcriptional regulation ( kuo and kinsella , 1998 ) .\nthis finding was reinforced by studies that demonstrated dna damage dependent stabilization of the r2 protein without any change in mrna after ir exposure in mouse balb/3t3 cells ( chabes and thelander , 2000 ) ; however it was in contrast to earlier work showing transcriptional activation of the r1 and r2 promoters after exposure to ir in the same cell line ( filatov et al . , 1996 ) . even though the precise mechanism of r2 response to ir damage is unclear , work has shown that human nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing r2 demonstrate a significant increase in radioresistance and fewer dna double strand breaks ( dsb ) after exposure to ir ( kuo et al . , 2003 ) , confirming the concept that r2 is important in the cellular response to ir\nthe second theory involves the p53 inducible subunit , p53r2 , first reported by tanaka et al .\nthey showed that p53r2 was not cell cycle regulated ( unlike r2 ) , but was significantly induced after exposure of normal fibroblasts to ir ( tanaka et al . , 2000 ) and was found to translocate to the nucleus , the proposed site of most important dntp production ( r2 did not ) . in cells that lacked wild - type ( wt ) p53 ,\nthere was no induction , indicating that functional p53 was necessary for p53r2 up - regulation .\ncells transfected with p53r2 were resistant to dna damage induced cell death . in agreement with other studies , they found no increase in r2 mrna , but did not measure protein levels .\nadditional studies have subsequently shown that p53r2 forms an active complex with r1 ( guitett et al . , 2001 ) and\nrr activity increased in correlation with the increase in p53r2 , however the response of r2 was variable , with decrease in some lines and a moderate increase in the others ( yamaguchi et al . , 2001 ) .\nfinally , other models are possible , including one described by xue and colleagues . in their study , both subunits were found to bind p53 in human oropharyngeal carcinoma cells , and in response to ir , were released to bind r1 in the nucleus ( xue et al . , 2003 ) , highlighting a third possibility in contrast to those previously presented .\nclearly , there is still work to be done in elucidating the response of rr to ir .\nmany of the differences seen in the studies discussed can likely be attributed to the use of different techniques , materials , and especially cell lines .\nwhat should be clear is that rr is involved in the cellular response to ir and targeting it is both rational and likely desirable in enhancing the treatment of cancers with ir .\nit is likely that both r2 and p53r2 are involved to a different degree in different cancers , with cellular phenotype likely playing a key role in determining their relative significance .\nhydroxyurea ( hu ) is a hydroxylated analog of urea and was the first rr inhibitor to be extensively studied .\nit has directed activity at the tyrosine radical moiety of r2 and was first found to be active against cancer cells in 1963 ( stearns et al . , 1963 ) .\nsubsequent experiments in vitro showed that in addition to its direct inhibition of dna synthesis , it was also a sensitizer of cell killing by x - rays , particularly if given before or after ir ( sinclair , 1968 ) .\nlater experiments showed that this was also the case in in vivo animal tumor models using isotransplants of spontaneous c3h / he mouse mammary carcinomas ( piver et al . , 1972 ) .\nthe total dose of ir to cure 50% of tumors was reduced when hu was combined with fractionated ir , although this effect was nt seen with single fraction ir treatments . given these encouraging pre - clinical results during the 19601970s ,\nhu was subsequently examined in a number of clinical trials in a variety of human cancers .\nthe majority of these trials have occurred in cervical cancer , most commonly in locally advanced disease . in particular , there were a number of prospective randomized controlled trials in the 1970s and 1980s that examined the effect of hu plus radiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone .\nand the gynecologic oncology group ( gog ) enrolled 190 women with figo stage iiib or iva cervical carcinoma .\nhu was administered orally at 80  mg / kg starting on the first day of irradiation and every 3  days thereafter for 12  weeks .\npatients received at least 50  gy minimum tumor dose to the whole pelvis followed by a single brachytherapy treatment of 20  gy to point a. in spite of the large number of patients enrolled , only 90 were eligible for assessment of response .\nthis was due to ineligibility ( wrong stage , wrong cell type , etc . ) and those that were inevaluable ( refused treatment , periaortic node irradiation , improper field , etc . ) .\nthe data were impressive , with a complete response ( cr ) of 68.1% in the hu group vs. 48.8% in the placebo ( p  =  <  0.05 ) , and a median progression free survival ( pfs ) of 13.6 vs. 7.6  months ( hreshchyshyn et al . , 1979 ) . however , myelosuppression was more common in the hu group , with seven grade iii or iv myelotoxicities .\nthey recruited 148 women with figo iib or iiib cervical carcinoma and again compared hu to placebo in the setting of conventional radiotherapy , with hu given every 3  days for 12  weeks .\nof the stage iib patients , 74% receiving hu had no evidence of disease at the completion of therapy compared with 43.5% of the placebo ( p  =  <  0.01 ) .\nof the stage iiib patients , the cr rates were 52.5 vs. 33% ( p  =  0.22 ; piver et al . , 1977 ) .\nagain , 78% of patients in the hu group developed leucopenia vs. 11% in the placebo group indicating a significant toxicity in addition to the improved clinical effect . at the time these studies were published\n, it was felt that hu added significant benefit to the treatment of locally advanced cervical carcinoma , and hu plus radiotherapy became the standard of care for the gog .\nhowever , over time , much of the data in these studies has been challenged , particularly in a systematic review by symonds et al .\nthey found a number of methodological problems with the studies such as small sample size , large numbers of exclusions post randomization , subgroup analyses of already small groups and questionable censoring .\nthey concluded that hu  appears to add to acute toxicity and probably increases late complications  and that  there is no convincing evidence of sufficient quality to suggest a therapeutic effect of this drug \nalthough the gog initially used hu as its standard of care in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer , it was nt long before this combination was supplanted by a new adjunct to radiation therapy . one of the most important studies prompting this paradigm shift was the gog 120 trial , first reported in 1999 ( rose et al . , 1999 ) and recently updated ( rose et al . , 2007 ) .\ngog 120 was a randomized phase iii study comparing cisplatin alone vs. cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hu vs. hu alone , in conjunction with pelvic irradiation for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer and pathologically negative para - aortic nodes .\nthey reported a significant improvement in pfs and overall survival ( os ) in both cisplatin containing arms ( p  <  0.001 ) , with relative risks for progression of disease or death of 0.57 and 0.51 for cisplatin alone and cisplatin , fluorouracil and hu , respectively , when compared with hu alone . in addition , toxicities were similar in all groups .\nfurther , a similar study by whitney et al . compared the efficacy of standard radiotherapy ( rt ) plus hu with standard rt plus fluorouracil ( 5-fu ) and cisplatin in a randomized controlled trial . in 368 women with figo stage iib , iii , or iva cancer of the uterine cervix , there were significant improvements in pfs and os with the 5-fu and cisplatin combination ( whitney et al . , 1999 ) .\nadverse effects included leucopenia : 4% of 5-fu / cisplatin patients and 24% of hu patients experienced grade iii or iv toxicity .\ngiven the findings of these studies , concurrent cisplatin and radiotherapy became the standard of care in locally advanced cervical cancer , spelling the end of hu use in the treatment of cervical cancer .\nin addition to its study in cervical carcinoma , hu has also been extensively investigated in other cancers , particularly head and neck .\nwhile early studies had significant flaws in methodology , a phase i study showed a 90% response rate in patients treated with hu , 5-fu , and palliative dose fractionated ir ( vokes et al .\n, 1989 ) , prompting a series of trials by the same group and others .\nthis included work by mantz et al . , who examined the benefit of hu when added to a more extensive chemoradiation protocol including cisplatin , 5-fu , leucovorin , and interferon-2b induction chemotherapy followed by 5-fu and hu with fractionated radiotherapy in 32 laryngeal cancer patients .\nmedian follow up was 44.5  months , and , after completion of all therapy , the cr rate was 94% .\nmedian os was 44.5  months , and median pfs was 86 , 78 , and 78% at 1 , 3 , and 5  years , respectively , which compared favorably with other published data and for the first time saw patients with stage iv head and neck cancer failing distantly more often than locally ( mantz et al .\nthe increased local control , unfortunately , was associated with increased toxicity , which has also been seen in other studies .\none phase i study with prolonged infusion of hu with hyperfractionated , accelerated , external radiation in patients with advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck showed an increase in the severity of swallowing toxicity compared with previous trials , with severe edema , and reductions in motility and mobility of pharyngeal and laryngeal structures ( beitler et al . , 1998 ) .\nthe same group later published a study examining the long term impact on swallowing that showed persistent , severe swallowing dysfunction ( smith et al . , 2000 ) .\ninterestingly , these studies examined continuous hu infusions based on pre - clinical data that suggested that hu should always be given concurrently with ir to maximize effect . even though local control was excellent , with just 4 of 26 patients experiencing recurrence ,\nquality of life is of great importance in these patients , and the late follow up reported esophageal strictures for the first time after chemoradiotherapy , suggesting that this particular regimen may be too aggressive .\nthe state of hu in head and neck cancer is well reviewed by argiris et al .\n( 2003 ) and while the authors are optimistic about the future of chemoradiation in head and neck cancer , it remains to be seen where hu and other rr inhibitors will fit in the future treatment of this disease site . even as hu has slowly progressed in the clinic\n, work has continued on examining the mechanism by which it sensitizes cells to the effects of ir . in particular , work by kuo et al .\nhas shown that the sequence with which cells are treated with hu plays an important role .\nthey demonstrated that in the caski cervical cancer cell line , clinically relevant concentrations of hu had a significant interaction with ir , with post - ir exposure  >  pre - ir ( kuo et al . , 1997 ) .\nthis was associated with increased g2 delay , suggesting a decrease in the repair of damaged dna .\nin addition , in cells overexpressing the r2 subunit , hu is able to return ir sensitivity to baseline ( kuo et al . , 2003 ) , demonstrating that r2 inhibition is the likely mechanism for hu radiosensitization in these cells .\nthese findings are potentially informative about the failure of hu to become established as a radiosensitizer in cervical cancer . in the majority of the early trials ,\ngiven that hu works best in vitro when dosed immediately after ir exposure , one could conclude that these trials were not optimized for best effect .\nin addition , hu has recently been shown to have a significant effect on the mechanism of dna dsb repair employed by cells after exposure to ir .\nburkhalter et al . showed that cells pre - incubated with hu were unable to use homologous recombination ( hr ) to repair dsb , and instead relied on non - homologous end joining ( nhej ) .\nin addition , cells that were nhej deficient had significantly more dsb after hu treatment ( burkhalter et al . , 2009 ) .\ngiven that nhej is thought to be the dominant dsb repair mechanism in cells treated with hu , rr inhibitors are likely to have enhanced activity in tumors that are nhej deficient .\neven with new studies on its mechanism of action , hu will likely remain consigned to history due to the many inadequacies it has as a drug molecule .\nwhile its oral absorption is almost complete and it is completely distributed in the water compartments of the body , hu has a short half - life ( between 1.6 and 4.45  h ; gwilt and tracewell , 1998 ) and its effectiveness is limited by relatively low affinity for rr and by the development of resistance .\none area where it could potentially find use in the future is in cns neoplasms , as it does cross the blood \nrecent studies have examined its use in progressive meningioma in combination with 3d - conformal radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy . in one trial ,\npfs at 1 and 2  years was 84 and 77% , which is similar to other adjuvant studies ( hahn et al .\nin spite of the mixed clinical data for hu , there is sufficient proof of concept to suggest that a rr inhibitor can be efficacious as a radiosensitizer in human cancers .\nthus , there has been a concerted effort to discover more potent molecules with more favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for this purpose .\none of the more promising of these is triapine , a thiosemicarbazone that destroys the tyrosyl radical in r2/p53r2 by forming a redox active complex with iron , producing reactive oxygen species . in studies comparing it with hu in vitro\n, triapine was shown to have significantly higher potency in both enzyme and cell assays .\nin addition , it was fully active against hu and gemcitabine resistant cells and was equally potent against r2 and p53r2 , whereas hu was approximately threefold less potent at binding p53r2 ( zhu et al . , 2009 ) .\nin addition , in in vivo models , triapine was active against hu resistant l1210 and kb cell lines and caused significant inhibition of solid tumor growth in mouse xenograft models ( finch et al .\nfurther studies have examined the radiosensitizing properties of triapine in a number of human cell lines .\nused a panel of three human tumor cell lines , including glioma , pancreatic , and prostate cancer cells , with triapine enhancing radiosensitivity when delivered 16  h before or immediately after ir by 1.5- to 2-fold .\nir interaction was associated with a reduction in the repair of dna dsb as evidenced by a persistence of h2ax foci at 24  h ( barker et al . , 2006 ) .\na similar effect was seen in mouse tumor xenografts , again , with greater effect if triapine was dosed just after ir .\nthe most effective temporal relationship between triapine dosing and ir is similar to that seen with hu in earlier pre - clinical studies .\ninterestingly , normal human fibroblasts were only sensitized when triapine was given before , not after ir , suggesting a potential for an improved therapeutic index for ir  triapine sequencing that may be incorporated into future clinical studies .\nare ic50 ( concentration of compounds producing 50% inhibition of recombinant rr activity ) values for both compounds in an in vitro rr activity assay with r2 or p53r2 bound to r1 ( zhu et al . , 2009 ) .\nalso shown are elimination half - lives ( t1/2 ) for both compounds ( gwilt and tracewell , 1998 ; kunos et al . ,\n2010b ) . of note , many cancers have virally or mutationally silenced p53 that allows rr activity to continue unchecked . in these cancers , it is potentially of increased importance to inhibit the r2 and p53r2 subunits that have lost p53 regulatory control .\nthis is the case in cervical cancer , where the vast majority have dysfunctional p53 due to hpv infection . in one study , three cervical cancer cell lines with mutated or dysfunctional p53\nwere irradiated 6  h after triapine exposure . in all cases , the cell lines were sensitized to ir and sustained dna damage as measured by persistence of h2ax foci . in addition , by measuring dctp levels , the investigators were able to show reduced rr activity in cells with and without functional p53 , demonstrating that the inhibition of rr is p53 independent ( kunos et al . , 2009 ) .\nthese findings were reinforced by further work of the same group that also showed a synergistic effect when cisplatin was added in addition to triapine and ir ( kunos et al . , 2010a ) .\nthese promising pre - clinical data have prompted the initiation of a number of clinical trials .\nindeed , triapine has so far been studied in 27 clinical trials in the usa at various stages of recruitment ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) , including those in both solid and hematologic malignancies .\nin particular there are three trials investigating the radiosensitizing potential of triapine , with data from one phase i study being published by kunos et al .\nthe purpose of their study was to assess the safety / tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and clinical activity of triapine three times weekly in concert with once weekly cisplatin and pelvic radiation in 11 patients with gynecologic malignancies .\ntriapine was dosed in 2  h infusions and the half - life was found to be 2  h. all 10 patients with advanced stage ib to ivb cervical cancer achieved complete clinical response , with a median 18  month follow up showing no disease progression in any of the patients .\nfive of the 10 patients had pet / ct evident pelvic or para - aortic lymphadenopathy before treatment , with complete resolution on follow up imaging after treatment ( kunos et al .\nin addition to the clinical data , the authors also examined objective markers of disease response .\nlate responders had a significantly higher rr activity on day 10 vs. day 1 and there was no temporal change in rr activity in the early responders , indicating that the expected spike in rr activity after ir was suppressed by triapine .\nthe fact that the late responders experienced durable responses in spite of elevated rr activity at day 10 suggests that there may be other mechanisms of triapine activity that require further study .\nthe promising results from this phase i trial prompted a phase ii trial which is now underway .\nover the last 10  years , there have been a number of major leaps forward in the field of radiation oncology that allow us to deliver higher doses of radiation in ever more specific ways to our patients .\nstill , in the vast majority of cases , we are constrained by dose limiting toxicities that must be accounted for when designing treatment plans and balanced against the therapeutic benefit realized .\ntherefore , the field of radio modulation and specifically radiosensitization will continue to grow in importance in the coming years as we search for ways to maximize the therapeutic index of our treatments .\nwhile there are many different radiosensitizers currently being studied , the rr inhibitors are among the oldest of targets , and are getting a new lease of life in recent times with the development of more modern drug molecules .\nas outlined in the review above , the story began with the study of hu in combination with ir in a number of pre - clinical trials in the 1960s , leading to a large amount of interest in the clinic , culminating with the gog adopting hu and ir as its standard of care in locally advanced cervical cancer . while its success in this arena was short\nlived , many parallel studies investigating the mechanism of action of hu were carried out , resulting in a far clearer understanding of the biological interactions between ir and rr inhibitors .\neven as hu was fading from view , investigators were working on successors including the intriguing molecule , triapine .\nas shown above , this drug works in a similar fashion to hu , but has significantly improved potency , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics .\nthe phase i study in cervical cancers that was recently published includes some very encouraging data , and the field waits in anticipation for the publication of further trials .\nit remains to be seen what the best dosing regimen for triapine will be , however the weight of pre - clinical data , including that with hu , suggests that daily dosing shortly after radiation therapy will be most effective and provide the greatest therapeutic window .\nthese authors would encourage studies incorporating this type of dosing schedule in the clinic , although this must obviously be weighed carefully against the potential for increased toxicity .\nin addition to triapine , there are other new rr inhibitors being tested at various stages , including trimidox and motexafin gadolinium .\n( 1994 ) , in a paper that reported 100-fold more potency at rr than hu in a cell based assay .\nsubsequent in vitro studies have demonstrated that while it acts as a radiosensitizer in panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells ( ahmed and hassan , 2000 ) , it is less potent than hu and further work is ongoing to fully assess its potential .\nmotexafin gadolinium is a texaphyrin molecule that targets thioredoxin reductase in addition to rr . in in vitro experiments , it was shown to inhibit rr with an ic50 of 26  m ( hashemy et al . , 2006 ) , although given that it has a number of other cellular effects , it is unclear how much of its potency as a radiosensitizer is due to rr inhibition alone .\nit is likely that the coming years will continue to see the emergence of new rr inhibitors with unique properties .\nthe recent advances in the understanding of rr biology and the development of new inhibitors places us at an important crossroads in the story of rr inhibitors .\nthere are sufficient data to provide proof of concept for the target from a biological standpoint , however clinical trials to this point have not been wholly convincing .\nit will be interesting to follow the development of the field in the next 510  years , particularly with the clinical trials of triapine in cervical cancer , and hopefully at least one of the many rr inhibitors being studied will eventually bring additional therapeutic benefit to patients in the near future .\nthe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest ."}

{"id": 39, "text": "the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy , although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma .\nthey seem to be different from those of regular antiepileptic medications ( aeds ) , and discovering what they are may lead to its use in clinical situations other than epilepsy as well .\nthe kd is comprised of four elements , the changes of any of them can potentially lead to losing its anticonvulsant effect : ( 1 ) increased amount of fat , usually in a ratio of 3 to 4 grams of fat for each gram of protein and carbohydrates , ( 2 ) as low a consumption of glucose as possible , ( 3 ) caloric restriction , and ( 4 ) fluid restriction .\nalthough there is some debate about the last component , clinical practice has shown that stopping fluid restriction can lead to seizure recurrence much in the same way as when stopping glucose restriction .  \nthe most important result of observing the diet is the increased blood level of free fatty acids ( ffas ) .\nthe ffas are transferred into the mitochondria , a process which requires the presence of an appropriate amount of carnitine , where they are degraded into ketone bodies through  oxidation .\nthese ketone bodies include  hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate , and acetone   ( figure 1 ) .  \nthe effect of the increased amount of ketone bodies seems to be the most prominent of all other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms of the kd .\nthe degradation of the ketone bodies delivers acetyl - coa directly to the tricarboxylic acid cycle , thus increasing its turnover while bypassing the need to depend on acetyl - coa coming from glycolysis to produce atp . unlike glucose , which requires a transporter to cross the blood brain barrier ,\nthe ketone bodies penetrate it easily . when this transporter is deficient , as in glut 1 deficiency , the kd is the preferred way of antiepileptic treatment , since it allows for bypassing the need for glucose .\nchildren in whom the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - coa is blocked , for instance , in pyruvate dehydrogenase ( pdh ) deficiency , will also benefit from bypassing this route .\n hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body measured in the blood , and it is used to monitor the degree of ketosis during therapy .\nthe breath of a patient who is ketotic while on the diet will often even smell of acetone .\nacetone is one of the ketone bodies that have an anticonvulsant effect in several types of mouse seizure models .\nthe mechanism of this effect is unknown , although an effect on k2p channels has been proposed .   by means of the tca cycle ,\nacetyl - coa increases the level of the neurotransmitters glutamate and -aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) and the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in brain , respectively .\nanother product of an elevated level of free fatty acids is polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) .\nthe potential ability of pufas to block seizure activity in the brain is speculated to be associated with some rather more complicated mechanisms , including ( 1 ) directly inhibiting voltage - gated sodium and calcium channels , ( 2 ) activating a lipid - sensitive potassium channel , ( 3 ) enhancing the activity of the sodium pump to limit neuronal excitability , ( 4 ) activating peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor- ( ppar ) , and ( 5 ) inducing the expression and activity of brain - specific uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria , thereby inducing a neuroprotective effect .\nneuroprotection can contribute to the anticonvulsant effect , but it may have other effects as well , which can lead to other clinical uses of the kd .\nappleton and de vivo   reported that the kd increased the total quantity of bioenergetic substrates ( adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) ) and elevated the energy charge in rat brain .\nacetoacetate , a product of  hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenation , is transferred into acetyl - coa which enters the tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle .\nthe increased turnover of the tca cycle generates protons and electrons that are channeled to the electron transport chain .\nthis , in turn , drives the formation of atp from adenosine phosphate ( adp ) by atp synthase .\nenhanced atp can either be converted to phosphocreatine for energy storage or broken into adenosine .\nenhanced atp levels provide energy reserves for a neuron to continue functioning under stress . increased extracellular adenosine offers a neuroprotective buffer against insults , reduces excitation , and averts excessive atp demands , thus providing local seizure control and neuroprotection .  \nit was also suggested that the kd influences toward an upregulation of transcripts encoding energy metabolism enzymes and increase in the density of mitochondria in neuronal process , leading to heightened energy reserves .\nan improved energetic status can support seizure prevention , for instance , by supporting gabaergic inhibition .\nit is suggested that adaptive processes to the metabolic changes induced by the diet lead to changes in gene expression which in turn result in some of the above - noted changes .\nother path of neuroprotection is modulated through decreased generation of ros which is considered to be related to pufas effect on uncoupling proteins .\nthe fact that the kd is considered a proven therapy with relatively few adverse affects and wide clinical experience , particularly in children , led to recent studies investigating new potential uses for other neurological disorders .\none of the most intriguing and active fields of research is the effect of a high - fat caloric - restricted diet on the survival of brain tumors cells .\nit is hypothesized that mitochondrial abnormalities impair the ability of brain tumors to generate energy from ketone bodies . unlike normal cells ,\nmalignant tumor cells have impaired genetic adaptability due to their genetic abnormalities and , therefore , increased susceptibility to environmental stress , such as fasting or caloric restriction .\nthe same genomic defects that are involved in the creation of brain tumors can be exploited for their destruction [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] .   in 1995 , nebeling et al\n.   reported two young girls with unresectable advanced stage brain tumors who had poor response to radiation and chemotherapy .\nthey were treated with a kd and their response was remarkable , both clinically and according to positron emission tomography follow - up scans .\ndescribed a patient with glioblastoma multiforme whose tumor , which is very malignant , improved on the kd . surprisingly , despite the appealing efficacy of this treatment , no further human studies or clinical trials on the kd as a therapy for brain tumors have been conducted .\nseveral laboratory studies in mouse and rat models have recently confirmed that inhibition of brain tumor growth is directly related with reduced levels of glucose and elevated levels of ketone bodies .\nmoreover , the kd was shown to reduce reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the brain .\ncancer cells need high levels of ros for the induction of angiogenesis and the production of tumor growth factors , thus , through this mechanism the kd can be protective .\nthe clinical manifestations were mainly intractable seizures that necessitated repeated admissions to the intensive care unit , as well as severe cognitive and alertness decline .\nafter the oncologists decided that antitumor treatment would be ineffective , she was started on the kd .\nafter four weeks of trial , it did not have any effect on the tumor progression .\nhowever , it did have a notable improving effect on cognition , alertness , and mood of the girl , in spite of her devastating condition .\nthe beneficial effect of the kd on cognition , alertness , and mood is well recognized , and clinical experience shows that in many times it is not less important than the anticonvulsant effect .\nthe potential neuroprotective effect of the kd was what motivated investigations into its potential as a treatment option in other neurologic disorders .\nthere are increasing numbers of reports that ketosis achieved by starvation or administration of a kd has a consistent neuroprotective effect after various brain injuries in animal models .\none human pilot study and several animal model studies have shown improvement in autistic behavior parameters with kd treatment .\nit remains to be further clarified whether this improvement is related to reduced epileptic activity found in up to 30% of these patients or to a primary effect of the kd .  \na factor that can be crucial for the application of the kd in medical conditions other than intractable epilepsy is the inherent difficulties in its use .\ndietary restriction can pose a significant problem in a child with a progressive tumor that undergoes massive chemotherapy , who may already be cachectic .\nthe kd may not be an option in a grown - up hyperactive autistic child .\nthus , the neurologist must evaluate the appropriate clinical , familial , and environmental situations very cautiously prior to the recommendation of the kd . in conclusion ,\nthe major metabolic effect of the kd is in supplying the brain with an increased amount of free fatty acids .\ntheir degradation into ketone bodies , together with the load of pufas , leads to major changes in the metabolic , bioenergetic , mitochondrial , and even genetic constellation .\nwhether it may also be effective in other pathologies , especially in treating malignancies , awaits future research ."}

{"id": 41, "text": "embryos generated through assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) are deemed surplus when , for some reason , they are not used for reproductive purposes ( svendsen and koch 2008 ; haimes and taylor 2011 ) ; instead , they are then disposed of or , where this is allowed by a country s art regulation , may be donated for a variety of research purposes .\nthus , the generation and subsequent fate of embryos that are designated surplus are determined as much by legislation as by embryo biology or technological constraints .\nfor example , legislatures differ in whether cryopreservation of embryos is permitted , meaning that in some countries any ivf embryos not immediately transferred for pregnancy are surplus , while in others they may be frozen for later transfer . in some countries , the law considers surplus embryos as the primary source of material for human embryonic stem cell ( hesc ) research , while in others this use of embryos is expressly forbidden .\nalthough hesc research has been subjected to exhaustive ethical scrutiny , the lack of consensus on the ontological or ethical status of surplus embryos means that the uses to which they may then be put remain contested ( deckers 2007 ; guenin 2008 ; moller 2009 ) .\neven if using human embryos for stem cell research is deemed permissible , ethical issues continue to emerge as new social practices and roles develop around the act of embryo donation .\nthe relative novelty of these practices and roles , complicated by the pace of change in technical possibility and regulation , mean that there is still uncertainty about how to conceptualise embryo donation , not just in terms of systematic ethics but as a sociomoral practice in everyday social life and morality ( banks , scully , and shakespeare 2006 ) . from a sociological perspective , and also to understand more generally how everyday morality deals with unprecedented ethical dilemmas , it is important to examine which conceptualisations emerge as salient and how they are stabilised and used .\nfor example , one way of thinking about the donation of embryos to research is as a bodily gift relationship , one of the many established by modern biomedicine such as the donation of eggs and sperm for reproductive purposes , organs or tissues for transplantation , blood for transfusion , and other biological tissues for research .\ndrawing analogies to existing practices in this way has proved helpful in other instances of bioethical novelty ( hofmann , solbakk , and holm 2006 ) .\nhowever , analogies can equally well be misleading , if there are morally relevant but unacknowledged differences between situations .\nthe contexts in which different organs and tissues are donated vary significantly , and these differences influence the sociomoral understanding of donation in each case and make them noncomparable in ethical terms\n. reproductive tissue , for example , is generally distinguished from other types of donated tissue because eggs , sperm , and embryos have the potential to give rise to new individuals , not just to prolong the lives of existing individuals , or to be used for research . because embryos are generally considered to have a different moral status from other tissues , the use of surplus embryos in research raises moral unease about the instrumentalization of human life that is not raised in quite the same way by the donation of either ova or sperm .\nit is therefore unclear whether an embryo can meaningfully be treated as a  gift  (  donation  ) without blurring the morally relevant differences between embryos and other tissues .\nsimilarly ,  hesc research ,  to which the embryo may be given , is a domain of biomedical practices and not an entity . as such\n, hesc research is not a subject with which a gift relationship can be established ( unlike , for instance , an organ recipient ) .\nunderstanding the social and ethical meanings that are emerging for the practices associated with embryo donation calls for a detailed empirical examination of people s reasoning behind donation decisions .\nhowever , most empirical studies of embryo donation have not focused on people s donation rationales in depth ( with some exceptions ; for example , haimes et al . 2008 ; de lacey 2003 ) .\nthe scarcity of data on donor rationales means there is a corresponding lack of information on contextual and other factors that influence donor decisions and how these can be related to the evaluations of theoretical ethics .\nthe authors of this paper have been involved in a series of linked qualitative studies of practices of embryo donation , first in the united kingdom ( researcher haimes and colleagues ) , then switzerland ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz ) , and in a smaller pilot project in china ( mitzkat , rehmann - sutter , and haimes ) .\nall three studies shared an interest in understanding reasons for the donation or non - donation of embryos . while the studies in switzerland and china drew upon the original u.k .\ndesign , each study was conducted independently , and the details of each project , including interview design , differed in light of the varying regulatory , clinical , and cultural contexts . however , by looking across the three data sets , we hope to gain cross - cultural insights into donation and non - donation rationales and the moral understandings on which they are based .\nthe three studies all used open - ended , semi - structured , one - off interviews between the researcher and people who had been in the position of deciding whether to donate their surplus embryos to research .\ninterviews were designed to explore in depth not just the interviewees decision about donation but also the background to that decision , such as their ivf story , their family and other relationships , their relationship with the clinic and its staff , and so on .\nthe interviews were transcribed , coded , and initially analysed to identify the reasons for donation decisions given by participants in each study , using an interpretative approach that all of us have previously found useful for identifying key themes around decision - making and implicit or explicit ethical judgements ( charmaz 2006 ; smith , flowers , and larkin 2009 ) .\nstudy ran for more than three years ; after some familiarisation and observation in the collaborating clinic , 44 in - depth interviews were conducted with couples who had been asked to donate their surplus fresh embryos , generated through ongoing ivf treatment , to hesc research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ) . in the united kingdom , it has been possible for some years to donate unused embryos to stem cell and other kinds of research and also to other couples .\nthe swiss study was carried out shortly after a change in the law that permitted fresh or cryopreserved surplus ivf embryos , under strictly defined conditions , to be donated to stem cell research only . in this study , 17 individuals who had variously chosen to donate or not to donate were interviewed ; thus , the decision concerned the fate of cryopreserved embryos some time after the ivf treatment that had produced them ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . the chinese work involved a much smaller three - month pilot study carried out in a large art hospital .\nit was designed as a pilot to provide a comparison with the u.k . and swiss material and is , therefore , included here despite the low number of participants , but with no attempt to draw general conclusions from it .\nlegislation in china does not allow the donation of embryos to other couples , but consent can be given for a surplus embryo to be used in stem cell research or for it to be discarded .\nthe study included participant observation of the information and consent procedures and qualitative interviews with five ivf patients , three choosing to donate to stem cell research and two refusing ( mitzkat , haimes , and rehmann - sutter 2010 ) .\nfor the purposes of this paper , the authors involved in the studies jointly compared the rationales for donation decisions given by their participants .\nwe also independently reexamined interview transcripts for material relevant to the discussion of gratitude . in the rest of this paper , we first identify and compare the main reasons given by participants in these three studies for their decisions to donate or to refuse to donate their surplus embryos to research .\nwe then look in more detail at the implications of our findings for one area of potential ethical concern : the possible role of gratitude in making embryo disposition decisions . in this way\n, we not only collect empirical data to help understand the emerging moral meaning of a new practice , but also give an example to show how empirical data can be used to question and then refine the conceptual basis of bioethical theory .\nparticipants who chose to donate their surplus embryos to research had a background premise that donation is fundamentally permissible because embryos do not have the sort of ontological or moral status that would forbid it .\nthe swiss study discovered people stating this explicitly :  [ embryos ] are not , they are not yet people ; they are nt beings with souls as far as i m concerned ,  as one swiss participant said.1 but this did not mean that the surplus embryos were considered as morally equivalent to any other tissue , and participants in both the swiss and u.k .\ninterviewees stopped themselves midway through sentences referring to the  left over embryos ,  which they clearly felt , on reflection , was an inappropriate phrase .\nso the embryos did not have the sort of moral status that would have made it wrong to donate them , but neither were they completely disposable .\nto some of our participants , embryos had a value ; they were a precious resource ( haimes et al .\n2008 ) that made simply throwing them out an unjustifiable waste . as another u.k .\n[ i]t just really seemed a waste , really , not to have them used .\n it was not always clear , however , quite how interviewees were using this notion of  precious  : whether with reference to economic  bio - value  ( waldby 2000 ; waldby and mitchell 2006 ) or because they had been obtained at intense personal and emotional cost , or because they had high moral value , or possibly a combination of all these aspects\n. particularly in the swiss study , which involved cryopreserved embryos stored for some time , participants referred to embryos moral status in a nuanced way that was highly sensitive to the developmental stage of the embryo , its physical location ( whether inside or outside the body ) , and its state ( whether cryopreserved or not ) ( see scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) .\nstudies seemed less interested in explicitly defining  the  moral status of an abstract embryo than working out what their own particular embryos meant for them at defined points in their own story , and what this meaning then indicated it was morally permissible for them to do with that embryo .\nacross all three studies the commonest rationale for opting to donate was a willingness to contribute to potentially curative medical research .\nsuch research was seen as a valuable endeavour by those like the swiss participant who said ,  i feel that , fundamentally , research has to go on , and i support that .\n donation of their spare embryos to research was therefore seen as a morally good act , based on a kind of ethical arithmetic in which simple disposal produced zero good from the surplus embryo , while donation had the potential to do good by supporting research . as one u.k .\ninterviewee said ,  it was quite simply that  we ve been helped by the system , we should help the system back.  not because of some sort of martyrdom or heroics or anything like that , just quite simply that without such efforts things do nt progress .  in the u.k .\nstudy there was an added imperative to donate surplus embryos to research as there had been a lot of press coverage about the hoped - for curative outcomes of stem cell science : \ni think the research is very important , like it was in the news a while ago to say that [ the senior clinician ] was successful in stem cell research and that s what you need in order to provide medical assistance in the future , so i m all for it .\n this observation raises a separate ethical concern about the patients understanding of the information they were given about the research goals . here\nin the swiss study , the notification from the clinic storing the frozen embryos stated clearly that donation was to stem cell research , yet the majority of donors we interviewed who referred to research did so in terms that were directly relevant to infertility .\na lot of preparatory work , research work , went on before medicine

participants , then , their donation decision appears to have been driven in part by what we could call a reparative urge .\nno indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below .\nacross all three studies the commonest rationale for opting to donate was a willingness to contribute to potentially curative medical research .\nsuch research was seen as a valuable endeavour by those like the swiss participant who said ,  i feel that , fundamentally , research has to go on , and i support that .\n donation of their spare embryos to research was therefore seen as a morally good act , based on a kind of ethical arithmetic in which simple disposal produced zero good from the surplus embryo , while donation had the potential to do good by supporting research . as one u.k .\nwe ve been helped by the system , we should help the system back.  not because of some sort of martyrdom or heroics or anything like that , just quite simply that without such efforts things do nt progress .  in the u.k .\nstudy there was an added imperative to donate surplus embryos to research as there had been a lot of press coverage about the hoped - for curative outcomes of stem cell science : \ni think the research is very important , like it was in the news a while ago to say that [ the senior clinician ] was successful in stem cell research and that s what you need in order to provide medical assistance in the future , so i m all for it .\n this observation raises a separate ethical concern about the patients understanding of the information they were given about the research goals . here\nin the swiss study , the notification from the clinic storing the frozen embryos stated clearly that donation was to stem cell research , yet the majority of donors we interviewed who referred to research did so in terms that were directly relevant to infertility . for instance , one participant said , \na lot of preparatory work , research work , went on before medicine was advanced enough that it was possible for us to have children .\n [ t]his is now maybe a tiny tiny contribution , that we can give back , if we now donate a , er , fertilised egg , perhaps for further research .\n note that in the chinese pilot study none of the participants spoke in precise terms about the research involved ;

some of our participants said that in their case they felt so . )\nthey did not indicate that they felt their use of ivf in itself had been wrong , but articulated the sense that in ending up with surplus embryos they had done something less than ideal . for these swiss participants ,\nthen , their donation decision appears to have been driven in part by what we could call a reparative urge .\nno indication of any similar reparative urge was observed in either the u.k . or the chinese interviews : we discuss this difference further below .\napproximately half of the swiss participants who were interviewed turned out to have decided against donation and instead have their surplus cryopreserved embryo(s ) destroyed .\nnone of these explicitly used the moral status of the embryo as the fundamental basis for rejecting donation to research .\nthe scientists  would do with their embryo , which was articulated either as disapproval of specific types of research ( e.g. ,  not if it s for cloning  ) or as a more general unwillingness to relinquish responsibility of the embryo to unknown others . in both sets of reasoning , therefore , participants were expressing unease about the loss of control over what would happen to their embryo .\nthe two chinese interviewees who had opted against donation also did so because of reservations about lack of knowledge of exactly what the embryos would be used for , explicitly mentioning the fear that they would be donated to ( i.e. , used to generate pregnancy in ) other women .\nin addition , two of the swiss participants gave financial reasons , that is , they expressed anger that they would not be compensated for giving up their embryo and that through donation researchers were  getting something for nothing .\nstudy , speculation about why some people might refuse to donate raised concerns about what might be done with the embryos and whether a baby would be developed through experimentation ; others wondered if  refusers  were worried that another infertile couple would receive their embryos and have a baby when they , the embryo providers , failed to do so .\nsample contained only two actual refusers , who objected on the grounds of possible use in animal research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ; hug 2008 ) .\nthese observations provide material for an empirically grounded bioethics of the ivf  stem cell interface ( franklin 2006 ) . in the rest of this paper , we consider a single aspect in detail : the potential  problem  of gratitude influencing informed consent .\nempirically , the main reasons given by our participants for donation were : ( 1 ) to avoid the waste of a precious resource , ( 2 ) to give something back to research , and ( 3 ) to compensate for a perceived moral wrong . in none of the three countries\ndid our participants indicate that their decision arose out of any sense of gratitude to the physician who had given them ivf treatment .\nthis is an important observation , because the possible impact of gratitude on informed consent in embryo donation has previously been raised by bioethical commentators .\nit has been suggested that if there is any institutional or procedural link between ivf treatment and hesc research , the potential donors gratitude toward the clinicians who have helped them to conceive may steer them toward opting for donation ( haimes and luce 2006 ; parry 2006 ; mcleod and baylis 2007 ; also discussed in roberts and throsby 2008 ) .\nthe bioethical concern is that parents who receive the  gift of a baby  will feel a sense of gratitude ; feeling grateful might then cause parents to feel that they should respond with a gift in return ; and if a request for donation of surplus embryos is made in that context , potential donors might inadvertently be encouraged to see donation as an appropriate form of return gift . in this way\nthe moral emotion of gratitude could compromise the potential donor s freedom to weigh the pros and cons of the request , which in turn means compromising the capacity to give fully voluntary consent .\neven where the clinicians and researchers themselves are scrupulous about not using persuasion , gratitude might be persuading potential donors to do something they would not otherwise choose to do . to avoid this possibility , countries that allow embryo donation for research may attempt a strict separation of ivf treatment and the stem cell research domain .\n( not all legislatures do this , however : china is one country that does not . ) in the united kingdom , for example , it is accepted good practice that requests for donation of spare embryos should not be made by the physician(s ) who delivered the original ivf treatment . in switzerland ,\na predominant interpretation of the current law on embryo donation is that a couple undergoing ivf treatment should not be told even of the theoretical possibility that a surplus embryo might be generated unless it actually is ( porz et al .\nregulators hope to rule out any conflict of interest on the part of the treating physician as well as the possibility of gratitude on the part of the patient .\nthere are several theoretical questions that can be asked about a claim that the  risk  of gratitude affects potential donors decisions .\nfor example , moral psychologists might want to examine the emotional exceptionalism in which gratitude is seen as potentially compromising , while other emotions , or even the absence of emotion , is not .\nthere is also an obvious empirical question which does not seem to have been closely examined : whether potential embryo donors actually do experience a sense of personal gratitude to the physician  or one strong enough to sway their donation decision .\nhowever , they do indicate that participants rationales for donation indicate a desire to  give back  in a more complex way .\nfirst , our empirical results show the importance of distinguishing between the three moral emotions of gratitude , indebtedness , and solidarity .\nwhat we normally mean by gratitude is an emotion primarily associated with gifts or with help that is undeserved .\ngratitude has been defined as  a feeling of thankful appreciation for favours received  ( guralnik 1971 , 327 ) and is experienced as a positive emotion .\n( 2006 ) provide a basis from experimental psychology for distinguishing between indebtedness and gratitude .\none important distinction is that  indebtedness is an emotion of exchange , whereas gratitude is not  ( watkins et al .\neven if a debt of gratitude is felt ,  it does not appear to be analogous to an economic debt \nindebtedness , however , is , literally , a debt : a  state of obligation to repay another  ( mauss 2001 , 2 ) .\na further feature associated with indebtedness but not with gratitude is the inherent imbalance of power , so that a hierarchy is created in which those who are indebted are rendered more vulnerable . the empirical social psychological work of watkins et al .\nindicates that , in experimental settings at least , a person s feelings of gratitude diminish as the expectation of return ( indebtedness ) increases . the more reciprocity is expected or demanded ,\nimportantly for considering the effects of these social emotions on donation decisions , watkins et al . found that the greater the expectation that something will be given back in return , the less motivated the participants were actually to comply with the norm of reciprocity ( watkins et al .\nthese results suggest that if patients were to sense any expectation of return by an individual physician or researcher , it would if anything lessen any gratitude they might have felt . in the ivf context , what people have received ( the thing for which they might feel grateful ) is their baby or pregnancy , or at the very least , treatment . donors who achieve this have not received a gift , but a medical service , which will have been paid for in one way or another . in switzerland , where ivf is not covered by the mandatory health insurance\n, this will often be direct payment from the patients to the clinic , as it will also often be in china . in the united kingdom ,\npatients who do not already have children commonly receive two  free  cycles of nhs treatment ( paid for through taxes on the population ) , and then they pay for future cycles directly through fees to the clinics . whatever the system of payment , however , the point is that the ivf physician or clinic has already been paid , directly or indirectly , for the treatment which produced the outcome .\nso in the case of embryo donation , it could be argued that neither gratitude nor indebtedness should be anticipated .\ngratitude would not be expected , because what patients have received was not a favour or unexpected gift ; and indebtedness would not be expected , because there is no debt if payment has already been made . in our three studies , although we found appreciation and high esteem were expressed for the work of the treating hospital or team , we found no evidence of gratitude being expressed toward an individual physician .\nthis is despite the fact that in both the united kingdom and china mention was made of the well - known head physicians who led each clinic ; the mentions were in appreciation of their reputations , not as a debt of gratitude .\nparticipants wanted to do something with the surplus embryo that would be of benefit to research and medical treatment for infertility , but this was not directly associated with the physician who provided it originally . indeed , some of our interviewees were critical of aspects of their own ivf treatment , while still wanting to support the infertility research enterprise overall . in this context , it should be remembered that about half the swiss participants interviewed in fact chose not to donate , primarily out of anxiety about losing control over the fate of their embryos , but also in some cases because it meant researchers were  getting something for nothing .\nstudy , a few patients were suspicious that research was being prioritised over treatment and that embryos might have been kept back for the research rather than frozen .\nalthough only a small number of participants expressed this view , it has particular relevance here as it indicates clearly the absence of either gratitude or indebtedness : indeed , it suggests that these participants felt that , if anything , donation would mean the researchers were receiving something beyond their entitlement or were indebted to the patients rather than the reverse .\nsocial exchanges may entail giving back not to an individual , because the individual may be unknowable or because the benefit may not have come from a single identifiable person , but to  the pattern of social life \n( becker 1986)for example , giving back to the institutional biomedical research that had helped the participants . in serial reciprocity , person a receives something from person b , but pays back not to person b but to some other third party ( moody 2008 ) . serial reciprocity accounts for the way that altruistic blood donors often do describe their action in terms of reciprocity , even though they have not received anything from the person to whom their blood eventually goes .\nwhat drives serial reciprocity is not gratitude or indebtedness to an individual or an organisation but a sense of solidarity with unknown others in the community . in the case of embryo donation , what appears to be a directly reciprocal act of gratitude  a surplus embryo in return for treatment  may thus be understood as something quite different .\nparticipants in our studies used a rationale for donation based not on reciprocal exchange between individuals , but on  giving back to  a research enterprise from which they had benefited and which they hoped would benefit unknown others in the future . for the swiss and chinese donors who choose to donate because they think they are supporting infertility research , these unknown others are not completely anonymous : they are  known  because of imaginatively shared experience .  giving something back  to the research that had helped them ( as they think they are doing )\nwas not considered an obligation but , rather , a form of return that was meaningful and seemed especially fitting to them because of the experiences they had gone through . in the u.k .\nstudy , although there was greater clarity about the purpose of the research being contributed to , there was still a sense among embryo providers that they were benefiting from the fact that others had participated in research in the past which had improved ivf ; they were clear in expressing solidarity with this imagined community of previous ivf research contributors by making their own contributions to research , albeit research in another domain .\nat least some of our participants , then , also see their donation to research as an indirect way of passing on the benefit they have received from research to someone else , whose situation in some way resembles their own .\nthe social meaning of this indirect reciprocity is neither gratitude nor indebtedness , but solidarity with other present and future patients .\nto summarise : our interpretation of the material suggests that donors reasons for donating were not connected in any straightforward way to either gratitude or indebtedness . for some people\nthe desire not to waste a valuable ( in more than one sense ) resource is foremost .\na generally positive stance toward biomedical science means that donation is a good use of a valuable resource . with some of the swiss participants\n, we also identified a reparative urge coming from a sense of moral unease , and here donation seems to offer a route through which the urge to make reparation can be satisfied .\nall of this suggests that neither gratitude nor indebtedness per se are present in decision - making at the ivf  stem cell interface , at least not in terms of undue inducement or of compromising the capacity for informed consent .\nthe reparative urge foregrounds a different set of ethical questions about the sociomoral meaning of the generation of spare embryos and the act of donation .\nfor example , the perceived need for reparation that appears to drive some of the swiss participants donation choices arises because people felt some sense of wrongdoing at creating embryos that are not used for pregnancy .\nthe spirit of the swiss legal framework strongly reinforces the sense that the occurrence of embryos not used for pregnancy is to be considered as wrong . from this point of view\n, one possible conclusion could be that the felt desire for reparation is in fact an ethically appropriate response : if the act of deliberately creating an embryo is a morally significant one , which needs to be justified by the good of its intended outcome ( pregnancy ) , then not using it for the purpose that justifies it does indeed present a genuine ethical difficulty .\non the other hand , the novelty of surplus embryos in the swiss legal and social context ( scully and rehmann - sutter 2006 ) meant that many patients would have been unaware at the time of their ivf of the possibility of generating a surplus embryo .\nmoreover , in most cases there were perfectly valid clinical or legal reasons why the embryos could not be transferred , which fully justified the failure to use them as originally intended . that these factors were not in the participants control\nthe swiss participants were quite aware of the valid reasons why their embryos could not be transferred , and yet some of them still said that they had fallen short of some moral standard .\nwe suggest that this persistent unease ( which does not appear so prevalent in the u.k .\nthese are captured in swiss legislation s highly defensive attitude toward embryos in general and the generation of surplus embryos in particular .\nswiss law operates from the presumption that a surplus embryo is an exceptional event that will happen only through the failure of regulation and practice specifically set up to prevent it ( porz et al .\nin addition , as we discussed earlier , the generation of surplus embryos is still an unfamiliar social practice and the role of the embryo donor is one that lacks widespread cultural recognition . in the swiss context of legal exceptionalism , then , producing one of these culturally unfamiliar entities may more readily be understood as something \nwrong  for which reparation is in order . in the more permissive cultural and legislative context of the united kingdom , although some interviewees expressed guilt about other aspects of the process ( for example , inappropriate styles of speech about embryos ) , there was no sense that not using the embryos as intended in itself constituted a moral failing .\nif our interpretation is correct , as the creation of surplus embryos becomes normalised in swiss society and the role of embryo donor becomes normalised in both the u.k . and\nswiss ( and other ) societies , there will be a shift in ideas about the moral meaning of surplus embryos , and this should be empirically testable . for the majority of the participants in switzerland and the united kingdom who chose to donate their surplus embryos , donation decisions were not driven by a reparative urge but by the feeling that donation expressed solidarity with research and/or other patients .\nwhat our empirical work shows is that gratitude to an individual must be distinguished from a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research .\nhowever , this does not necessarily mean that solidarity - based reciprocity has no relevant impact on the capacity for voluntary consent .\none possible consequence , for example , is that if potential donors feel solidarity with the research enterprise , or with present and future patients , then they might also experience an obligation to support it .\nhowever , in all three studies there were people who chose not to donate ( about half of the swiss interviewees did not donate , while in the united kingdom approximately 46 percent of those asked have been shown to opt against donation [ choudhary et al .\n2004 ] ) , which suggests either that there is no sense of obligation , or that it is neither universal nor irresistible .\nthere is a second problem if solidarity - based reciprocity is taken as something to be prevented .\nif there is a risk that gratitude felt by an individual could influence donation decisions , then the risk can be minimised by separating ivf and stem cell research physically and procedurally , as bioethicists have suggested and some clinics and guidelines have implemented .\nbut if instead there is a desire to benefit research or to show solidarity with collective  others  rather than an individual , then what sort of physical or procedural barriers could be set up to prevent it having an influence\n? there are further theoretical questions to be explored here about the assumption that contextual emotions such as gratitude or solidarity compromise the decision to donate .\nthe situation in which donation of a surplus embryo is a possibility comes about as a result of a variety of social , cultural , political , legal , and emotional features that combine to make the situation what it is .\nit will be important to identify carefully the features that are constitutive of the situation of having a surplus embryo ( including a sense of solidarity to similar others , emotional bonds with the embryo that change over time , regret over the failure to use all embryos for pregnancy , and so on ) and to consider whether these constitutive features can or should also be treated as factors that compromise the responsible , autonomous decision - making capacity of the people involved .\nthis introduces the question of the extent to which any decision to donate can be detached from its context and the contextual factors that shape how people respond to donation requests .\nfinally , we should not forget that the possibility that some donors misunderstand the kind of research they are donating to raises some ethical difficulty .\nit means that donors may be deciding for donation out of a misplaced sense of solidarity  a different ethical problem .\nthe deliberative processes of the donor participants in our three studies incorporated their appreciation of the particular moral value of their own embryos and of the value of biomedical research .\nthese deliberations are complex , and the participants own dependency on pre - existing medical research and their affiliation with others in similar situations must be recognised , we suggest , in order to understand how they might configure donation as a means to cope with the moral ambivalence of the situation in which they find themselves .\ntheir decisions are not driven by some unacknowledged sense of debt , but rather are responsive to the emerging social and moral reality of embryo donation in the first decade of the 21st century ."}
{"id": 42, "text": "thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine neoplasia which accounts for about 1% of human cancers .\nmtc originates from calcitonin - producing cells ( c - cells ) of the thyroid gland and accounts for 35% of thyroid cancers .\nmtc is relatively slow - growing tumor but , if metastasized or relapsed , it becomes very aggressive causing more than 13% of all thyroid cancer - related mortality . in the united states ,\nmtc has an incidence in children of 0.03 per 100 000 population per year with a fairly equal female to male ratio [ 4 , 5 ] .\nmtc occurs either sporadically or in an inherited autosomal dominant manner . in adults , sporadic mtc accounts for 6575% of mtc , but in children ,\nsporadic mtc is very rare ; the vast majority of mtc diagnosed in the childhood is hereditary .\nhereditary mtc occurs as a familial mtc ( fmtc ) or as a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia ( men ) type 2a and b syndromes , wherein other endocrine glands are also affected .\nmtc diagnosed during childhood almost always results from a dominantly inherited or de novo activating mutations in the ret proto - oncogene , which encodes the ret receptor tyrosine kinase [ 69 ] .\nadvances in predictive genetic testing for ret mutations have enabled early diagnosis of hereditary men syndromes and prophylactic thyroidectomy in presymptomatic patients to prevent mtc .\nthe early onset of mtc in hereditary syndromes makes it an important endocrine disease that is increasingly managed by pediatric providers [ 1012 ] . in this review\n, we discuss the etiology of pediatric mtc and currently available therapeutic modality for the cancer .\nret encodes a receptor tyrosine - kinase which is expressed in the neural crest - derived cell types , including thyroid parafollicular cells , neuronal cells , and adrenal medullary chromaffin cells . in these cell types\n, ret plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation , growth , differentiation , migration and survival . in humans\nafter alternative splicing at the 3 end , ret transcripts encode three protein isoforms with distinct c - terminal ends that contain either 9 ( ret9 ) , 51 ( ret51 ) , or 43 ( ret43 ) amino acids .\nret exon 19 is present in all transcripts and its differential splicing at the 3 end produces distinct transcripts wherein exon 19 is either unspliced , spliced to exon 20 , or spliced to exon 21 .\nall three resulting ret isoforms commonly contain a tyrosine ( tyr1062 ) whose phosphorylation is critical for their activation .\nthe major ret isoforms in vivo are ret9 and ret51 , which consist of 1072 and 1114 amino acids , respectively , and are usually co - expressed .\nret consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain , a trans - membrane domain , and an intracellular kinase domain ( figure 1 ) .\nthe extracellular domain includes four cadherin - like repeats and a highly conserved cysteine - rich region , which is located near the cell membrane .\nthe intracellular domain consists of two tyrosine - kinase subdomains , tk1 and tk2 , which contain multiple tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated during receptor activation and are required for the activation of different downstream signaling pathways of ret [ 19 , 20 ] .\nthe ligands for ret are the glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) family proteins , including gdnf , neurturin , artemin , and perseptin .\nactivation of ret also requires the formation of a heterodimeric complex recruiting a gdnf - family receptor alpha ( gfr ) . when unbound by a ligand , ret is monomeric , unphosphorylated , and inactive .\nwhen a ligand and the gfr co - receptor bind to the extracellular domain of ret , ret undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in their kinase domains .\nthis generates the docking sites for their downstream effectors that contain the src homology 2 domain .\nfor example , gdnf - mediated stimulation of ret results in activation of the pathways regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( pi3k ) and different mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) , including the extracellular regulated kinases ( erks ) , c - jun amino - terminal protein kinases ( jnks ) , the p38 mapk and the big map kinase ( bmk1 ) erk5 [ 22 , 23 ] .\nret is one of the first receptor tyrosine - kinases ( rtks ) that have been found to play a role in neoplasia , being most well - known as a key etiological factor for thyroid cancer [ 6 , 24 ] . activating mutations of ret\nabnormally enhance ret activity and can trigger tumorigenesis in certain organs although the exact underlying mechanisms are as of yet unclear .\nfirst , mutations of the six cysteine residues ( cys609 , 611 , 618 , 620 , 630 , and 634 ) in the extracellular domains can promote ret dimerization via disulfide bonds and result in constitutive ligand - independent activation of ret .\nsecond , mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domains can also confer ligand - independent catalytic activity to monomeric ret .\nthese ret mutants exhibit different patterns of autophosphorylation and altered substrate specificity [ 2628 ] . indeed ,\nactivation of different downstream signaling pathways is associated with different clinical features of ret mutant thyroid cancers , as observed in men2 syndromes discussed below .\nfor example , the hirschprung disease , a congenital disorder of neural crest development is caused by a loss - of - function ret mutation .\nof note , the hirschprung disease is closely associated with men2a , demanding a genetic screening for men2a for children with familial hirschsprung 's disease .\na strict correlation exists between specific ret mutations and the onset of hereditary mtc ( table 1 ) [ 31 , 32 ] .\nthe detailed and up - to - date information of ret sequence variations can be obtained from the men2 ret database ( www.arup.utah.edu/database/men2/men2_welcome.php ) , which also contains links to selected men2 literature reviews , gene and protein information , and ret reference sequences .\nthe men2a subtype , accounting for 9095% of the men type 2 cases , is a highly penetrant , autosomal dominant endocrine tumor syndrome characterized by the development of mtc in > 90% of ret mutation carriers . in association with mtc\nin addition , rare variants of men2a are also associated with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis and hirschsprung disease [ 35 , 36 ] .\npatients with men2a usually have mutations in the extracellular cysteine - rich region of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor , usually in exon 10 ( codons 609 , 611 , 618 or 620 ) or exon 11 ( codon 634 ) ( table 1 , figure 1 ) [ 31 , 37 ] .\nmore than 80% of men2a patients exhibit a specific substitution , i.e. , cys634arg , on exon 11 .\nmtc is generally the first manifestation of men2a syndrome and develops during early childhood , usually before age six and sometimes before age two . the men2b subtype accounts for approximately 510% of the men type 2 cases .\nmen2b patients typically feature early coincident onsets of mtc , pheochromocytoma , and gastrointestinal mucosal ganglioneuromas .\nvisible physical symptoms include mucosal neuromas of lips ( bumpy lips ) and tongue , and asthenic marfanoid body habitus [ 36 , 40 ] .\nmen2b patients usually have mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain 2 ( tk2 ) in the intracellular region of ret , which almost always ( > 95% ) lead to a single substitution , i.e. , met918thr , in exon 16 ( figure 1 ) [ 31 , 37 ] . de novo mutations , which usually occur on the paternal allele , are also common in men2b .\nmen2b is characterized by the early development of an aggressive form of mtc in all affected individuals , typically during the first year of life .\nthus , apart from the genetic testing of ret mutations in children born to a parent with men2b , early diagnosis of men2b remains challenging .\nindividuals with men2b are likely to develop metastatic mtc at an early age if they do not undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy before age one . without this intervention ,\nfmtc is considered as the least aggressive clinical variant of men2a with decreased penetrance and/or delayed onset of the other endocrine pathologic manifestations [ 39 , 43 ] . similarly to sporadic cases , familial mtcs are isolated and are not associated with other endocrine tumors .\npatients with fmtc harbor mutations similar to men2a in either the extracellular or intracellular region of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor [ 6 , 44 ] .\nthe onset of fmtc is relatively late , not appearing until the second or the third decade of life , and its penetrance is lower than the mtc caused by men2a and men2b [ 31 , 39 , 45 , 46 ] .\ntherefore , it is often difficult to determine fmtc based upon a family history and only careful genetic screening can distinguish between inherited and sporadic forms of mtc .\nmtc cells secrete the polypeptide hormone , calcitonin , and the glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) , and these are used as diagnostic biomarkers for mtc .\nmtc is most commonly diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining of fine - needle aspiration of a new thyroid nodule for calcitonin , chromogranin a , or cea .\nserum calcitonin is the primary biochemical marker used for detection , staging , postoperative management , and prognosis for mtc patients .\nhowever , in very rare cases , certain mtc cells do not secrete calcitonin , which makes diagnosis and patient follow - up difficult .\nsymptoms of mtc include neck pain , a palpable neck mass , and/or diarrhea resulting from hypercalcitoninemia .\nthe clinical course of mtc in men2 patients is variable and is determined by the codon specific mutations . in hereditary form , an age - related progression of malignant disease is observed , with lymph - node and distant metastases being typically detected years after the onset of tumorigenesis .\nmetastatic spread to cervical and regional lymph nodes ( i.e. , parathyroid , paratracheal , jugular chain , and upper mediastinum ) or to distant sites including the liver , lungs , or bone is common and is frequently present in individuals with a palpable thyroid mass or diarrhea .\npositive lymph - node status and higher stage at diagnosis predict lower disease - free survival and higher mortality [ 5 , 5456 ] .\nmen2 is one of few hereditary cancer syndromes for which predictive genetic testing is recommended at childhood .\ngenetic testing for hereditary mtc syndromes has had an enormous impact on reducing the incidence of mtc in the families affected by these hereditary syndromes [ 57 , 58 ] .\ngenetic counseling is indicated for all children diagnosed with mtc and others who either carry or are at risk of inheriting a ret mutation .\nchildren of patients with men2b should undergo ret analysis at birth , and children of patients with men2a or fmtc should undergo ret analysis before age six [ 59 , 60 ] .\neven 610% of apparently sporadic cases of mtc demonstrate de novo germ - line ret mutations , thus making genetic testing worthwhile in all patients with mtc .\nthus , all children with an affected parent in this setting retain a 50% risk of mtc , and surgical decisions must rely solely on clinical testing .\nthe standard treatment for mtc is surgical removal of all thyroid tissue including the posterior capsule [ 39 , 62 ] .\nearly thyroidectomy in all men2 patients can change the course of disease , either in a preventive or a curative fashion .\nthe american thyroid association guidelines task force has classified mutations based upon a model that uses the genotypephenotype correlations to rank the mutations into risk levels for the development of aggressive mtc from the lowest  a  to the highest  d  ( table 1 ) .\nthis classification may be used to predict phenotype , to recommend the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy and the extent of surgical intervention , and to begin biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism .\nthe ages at which the prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for the children tested positive for the ret gene mutation are as follows : ages 01 for ret mutations that carry the highest risk for aggressive metastatic mtc at young ages , i.e. , classified as  ata - d  ; before age 5 for ret mutations that carry a lower , yet still high risk of aggressive mtc at any age , i.e. , classified as  ata - c  ; after age 5 for ret mutations that carry a lower risk of aggressive mtc , i.e. , classified as  ata - b  or  ata - a ,  so long as the affected children have no other clinical signs of mtc development .\nthere is ongoing debate on what age the thyroidectomy should be recommended for fmtc patients .\nsome clinical institutes suggest the prophylactic surgery at age 1015 , depending upon the exact mutation and family history , while recommending yearly test of calcitonin levels prior to deciding the surgery .\nindeed , the ata management guideline for mtc has been very recently revised . in the setting of a prophylactic thyroidectomy ,\nthe lymph - nodes are not routinely removed since metastases are not expected to occur at this stage . in the case of clinically apparent mtc , whether sporadic or hereditary , thyroidectomy and concomitant central and compartment - oriented lateral neck dissection should be performed to increase clinical outcomes .\nprimary hyperthyroidism is rare during childhood ; therefore , parathyroidectomy is usually avoided , particularly during a prophylactic procedure .\ndissection and autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue is not typically performed at the time of thyroidectomy unless there is enough biochemical evidence for hyperparathyroidism .\nthyroidectomy in children is usually associated with a higher rate of complications , such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism , as compared to the surgery in adults .\ntherefore , pediatric thyroidectomy must be performed by highly experienced thyroid surgeons . for individuals with a ret mutation who have not had a thyroidectomy , annual biochemical screening of calcitonin levels is recommended and , if the results are abnormal , immediate thyroidectomy is required .\nannual serum calcitonin screening should begin at age six months for children with men2b and at age 35 for children with men2a or fmtc .\nbiochemical evidence of disease recurrence includes elevation of calcitonin and cea levels . all individuals who have undergone thyroidectomy\nneed thyroid hormone replacement therapy along with annual screening for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism depending upon the ret mutation present in the patients .\nmtc does not respond well to radiation therapy or the standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents , including doxorubicin , dacarbazine , capacitabine , and 5-fluorouracil [ 43 , 71 ] . of note ,\nthe mechanism - based targeted therapies that inhibit ret and other receptor tyrosine kinases have become available for the treatment of surgically inoperable progressive mtc .\nthese include the multi - kinase inhibitors , vandetanib ( zd6474 , caprelsa ) and cabozantinib ( xl-184 , cometriq ) , which have been recently approved by the us food and drug administration [ 72 , 73 ] . a recent phase i / ii trial of vandetanib in children with mtc reported partial responses in 47% patients .\nin general , the drug efficiency and the primary side effects , i.e. , diarrhea , rash , headache , hypertension , and nausea , were similar between children and adults .\nphase iii trial of cabozantinib demonstrated a 28% response rate in adults with significant adverse effects .\ntherefore , there is a critical need for more effective therapies for patients with advanced mtc .\ncharacterization of additional molecular pathways responsible for mtc development may allow the discovery of therapeutic targets that can be exploited to induce reduction of tumor size , disease stabilization , and symptomatic improvement [ 7782 ] .\nmtc and the men type 2 syndromes are rare but significant endocrine diseases that are increasingly encountered by pediatricians .\nour understanding of mtc has been greatly increased by the discovery of ret and the genotype \ngenetic tests according to the established guidelines should be performed whenever diagnosis of mtc is made .\ndue to limited adjuvant treatment options , adequate surgical treatment is critical for initial control of the disease and prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for children with men2a and men2b at an early age , sometimes during infancy .\nemerging newer treatments are expected to better treat this rare but life - threatening malignancy ."}
{"id": 43, "text": "neurosurgery is characterized by the delicate balance between surgical success and potential for devastating side effects . thanks to multiple technological improvements\n, the morbidity of neurosurgical interventions has substantially decreased over the last decades , allowing for the resection of previously inoperable lesions . in particular , image - guided neurosurgery ( igns ) devices allow the use of coregistered and fused multimodality 3d images to guide the surgeon 's hand and help define preoperatively the boundaries of pathological and predefined functional structures . meanwhile\n, new modes of medical imaging have also improved the localization of pathological lesions and their characterization .\nmedical imaging nowadays includes a wealth of different techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( smri and fmri ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , and positron emission tomography ( pet ) .\nalthough the overall accuracy of igns is estimated to be 12  mm , current neuronavigation systems can not , however , adapt to changing conditions over time .\nskull - opening brain shift , brain retraction , cerebrospinal fluid suction , lesion resection , perfusion , and pharmacological manipulation during surgery indeed all alter the 3d morphology of the structures [ 25 ] .\nthese changes can lead to localization errors that are one order of magnitude larger that igns accuracy [ 1 , 2 , 6 ] and may result in incomplete resections or unexpected damage to normal brain .\nsuch inaccuracies could be reduced if one could acquire , throughout surgery , fresh images of the same modalities and quality as the preoperative ones\nintraoperative images such as intraoperative mr ( imr ) images are  with the exception of a handful surgical facilities  usually acquired using low - field mri scanners that provide lower resolution and contrast than their preoperative counterparts , and , to this date , several useful imaging modalities , such as pet and possibly meg , can not be acquired intraoperatively .\none solution is to  bring over  the high - quality preoperative multimodality images into the intraoperative configuration of the brain using a nonrigid registration technique [ 710 ] .\none category of nonrigid registration techniques uses physics - based models , where landmarks are tracked in successive reduced - quality intraoperative images , and their displacement fields drive the deformation of a biomechanical model .\nso far , most of the mechanical conditions of the brain can not be estimated in the operating room , such as the volume of cerebrospinal fluid flowing out of the skull cavity , intercellular fluid volume changes that result from mannitol injection , or changes in blood volume and vessel permeability .\nthe fact that an intraoperative image can provide the knowledge of the current state of the brain after some deformation partly eliminates the need for a complete evaluation of these mechanical conditions .\nthe nonrigid registration technique replaces them with the landmark displacements evaluated from successive intraoperative images . using a nonrigid registration technique based on a biomechanical model , three types of brain deformations\nhave been identified that require specific modeling , although they depend on common parameters , such as csf suction , perfusion , or pharmacological manipulation .\nthe first deformation is the brain shift , which appears at the beginning of surgery with the opening of the skull and dura .\nthe suction or leakage of csf , as well as the release of intracranial pressure caused by tumor growth , generally cause such shift of the brain ( note that in this work , we name  brain shift  the specific shift of the brain that occurs after the opening of the skull and dura , before any other surgical act has happened ) .\nhowever , for these deformations , we will consider that the shift is a part of these two deformations .\nthe second deformation is the retraction ; when target tissues are located deep inside the brain , the surgeon incises brain tissues and inserts a retractor to spread out the tissues , and to create a path towards the target .\nthe third deformation is the resection , that is , the removal , of lesion tissues .\nthree deformations can thus be defined in terms of the two elemental actions that change the topology of the brain : the introduction of a discontinuity and the removal of some tissues .\nmost studies of brain deformation based on biomechanical models have focused on shifts ( the topology of the brain is not modified ) , that occurs just after the opening of the skull and dura [ 1125 ] .\na good review of these different studies can be found in [ 24 , 2628 ] .\nresection and retraction are more complex to model than ( brain ) shift . until recently ,\ntheir modeling for the specific application of preoperative image update has received much less attention .\none of the difficulty for modeling resection and retraction is that both induce a topological change of the brain because some tissue are cut .\na method of mesh adaptation [ 2931 ] or remeshing [ 3235 ] must be used in conjunction with fem if an accurate representation of the location of the cut , for example , the resection cavity or retraction path , is needed to deform the model . indeed , fem can not directly handle discontinuities that go through the fes , and requires to realign the discontinuity with fe boundaries . in the field of fracture mechanics , which studies the growth and propagation of cracks in mechanical parts\n, some methods were developed to avoid using fem in conjunction with mesh adaptation or remeshing .\nthe extended finite element method ( xfem or x - fem ) appeared in 1999   and has been the object of considerable research since then .\nxfem works by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within some fes of the mesh .\nthe mesh does not have to conform to the discontinuities , so that these can be arbitrarily located with respect to the underlying fe mesh . because xfem allows an accurate representation of the discontinuities\nwhile avoiding mesh adaption or remeshing , and because of the similarity between cracks in mechanical parts and cuts in tissue , we proposed the use of xfem for handling cut , resection , and retraction in the updating of preoperative images .\nthis paper presents a complete 3d framework for updating multimodal preoperative images with respect to surgical brain deformations , due to brain shift and successive resections , followed and quantified using imr images .\nour approach is modular , and is applied iteratively each time a new intraoperative image is acquired .\nwe take into account successive deformations based on a linear elastic biomechanical model which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the pair of imr images under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection .\nwhile some 3d results have already been presented for brain shift , and initial 3d results for resection   modelings , this paper is the first complete and detailed account of the generalization to 3d of our 2d previous work .\nwe present the state - of - the - art of resection modeling for preoperative image update . in section 3\n, we describe our basic strategy for updating preoperative images based on successive intraoperative images . in section 4 , we give detail about our methods and algorithms . in section 5 ,\nwe consider two patient cases that illustrate our approach for handling brain shift followed by successive resections .\namong studies that take into account resection for preoperative image update , one should distinguish two categories .\nthe first category of studies models brain deformation using two time - point images , the first image being acquired before surgery has started , the second image being acquired after resection . in this category ,\nthe methods that existed for a second image showing some brain shift are adapted for a second image showing some resection .\nthe second category of studies models brain deformation using more than two time - point images , and models at least two successive resections . among the first category of studies ,\nhagemann et al .   developed a 2d method for modeling brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and a postoperative mr image , the postoperative image showing a complete resection .\nthe 2d mesh of the biomechanical model corresponded to the underlying pixel grid of the 2d image .\nthe biomechanical model included four different linear elastic laws for the skull / skin region , the whole - brain region , the csf region , and the image background .\nthey computed the correspondence of the skull boundary , the whole - brain region boundary in the neighborhood of the tumor , and the posterior midline between the two images .\nthey also computed the correspondence between the internal tumor region boundary visible in the preoperative image , and the resection cavity boundary visible in the postoperative image , both boundaries corresponding under the assumption that the resection is complete .\nthe displacements fields of these landmarks drove the deformation of the biomechanical model . as a result , the biomechanical model presented high deformation in the tumor region , which is not physically plausible .\nhowever , the resection was complete , and , thus , they were not interested by the displacement field of the biomechanical model in the tumor region itself .\nclatz et al .   developed a 3d method for modeling the brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and an imr image , the latter showing partial or complete resection .\nthe biomechanical model was deformed based on a sparse volume displacement field evaluated from the two images , using a block matching algorithm . in their algorithm , blocks of voxels that presented discriminant structures were selected in the preoperative image .\nthe blocks were then matched to blocks in the imr image using a similarity criterion , for example , a coefficient of correlation .\nthe value of the similarity criterion was used as a value of confidence in the displacement measured by the block matching algorithm .\nthe biomechanical model was then deformed iteratively , driven by the sparse displacement field of the matched blocks , where a block rejection step was included for measured block displacements initially selected but considered as outliers . in the imr image , a part , or the totality , of the tumor tissues\nthe blocks were thus selected and matched in only the healthy - brain region of the two images .\nthey tested their algorithm on six patient cases , and used for validation nine landmarks picked up manually in each image .\nthey found a mean and maximum error on displacements of 0.75  mm and 2.5  mm , respectively .\nthey explained this phenomenon by the fact that a substantial number of block matchings were rejected in the tumor neighborhood .\nthe deformation of the biomechanical model in the tumor neighborhood was thus essentially governed by the linear elastic law , and the result might show the limitation of this model .\narchip et al .   also tested the nonrigid registration method presented in   on eleven patient cases , and used the 95% hausdorff distance   for evaluating the alignment of the nonrigidly registered images . as a result\n, they obtained a mean error of 1.82  mm . among the second category of studies , miga et al .  \nthey built a linear poroelastic biomechanical model and preoperatively tagged the tetrahedron fes that were going to be removed to simulate the brain deformation due to successive resections .\nsecond , a boundary condition was applied to the new boundary of the resection cavity , in order to model the relaxation of strain energy , induced by preoperative tumor growth or surgery acts , stored in the resected tissues , and released after their removal . in this approach ,\nthe tissue discontinuity was represented as best as possible with a jagged topology defined by the fe facets defining the boundary of the resection cavity .\n[ 45 , 46 ] also modeled the removal of tetrahedra in order to model the action of an ultrasonic aspirator in the context of real - time surgery simulation .\n[ 13 , 47 , 48 ] modeled successive resections based on several time - point imr images . between two successive images\n, they deformed the biomechanical model , in its current state of update , to take into account the ( partial ) resections(s ) that took place between these two images .\nfirst , the biomechanical model , in its current state of update , was deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain boundary between the pair of images under consideration .\nsecond , the fes that fell into the resection cavity in the second image of the pair were removed , while the fes that laid across the resection - cavity boundary were cut . to ensure the link between the successive deformed configuration of the biomechanical model , their algorithm kept track of the topology modification between fes and nodes of the mesh before and after the removal of fes .\nthey tested their algorithm on one patient case including five imr images ( the first two imr images being used for brain shift modeling ) , and used for validation thirty - two landmarks picked up manually in each image .\nthey found a mean and maximum error on the displacements of 0.9  0.7  mm ( mean  standard deviation ) and 3.7  mm , respectively .\nthey explained this phenomenon by the limited accuracy in the process of picking landmarks in that region , and because the retraction occurring between the second and third images was modeled as a resection , that is , a removal of tissues , even though the tissues were not removed but simply spread out .\nthe methods described above have been all developed using an fem - based biomechanical model for intraoperative image registration .\nthe objective of a surgical simulator is to provide an interactive manipulation with force feedback of the anatomical part to be operated using various surgical instruments . in order to model a large range surgical procedures ,\njebkov and kuhlen   have applied nonlinear xfem for simulating cut , and have shown that xfem is successfully efficient for such purpose .\nthe block diagram of figure 1 shows our global approach for updating preoperative images using successive imr images acquired at different critical points during surgery .\nalthough the principles of the approach are quite general , they are tailored for use based on images acquired with a 0.5  tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner , which guarantees that the full volume of brain tissues is included in the image field of view . in our present strategy ,\nthe preoperative images are updated incrementally . at the end of each update , the preoperative images should be in the best possible alignment with the last imr image acquired .\nprior to surgery , a patient - specific biomechanical model is built from the set of preoperative images . because the patient does not necessarily lie in the same position during the acquisition of each of the preoperative images\n, one may need to perform a rigid registration ( involving translations , rotations , and scales ) to bring these images into correspondence , assuming , in first approximation , there is no local , that is , nonuniform , brain deformation between preoperative images .\nonce the 1st imr image has been acquired prior to the opening of the skull , the set of registered preoperative images and the biomechanical model are registered to the 1st imr image via a rigid transformation . in the present situation , it is assumed that the patient 's brain imaged in the 1st imr image has the same physical shape as the brain imaged in the preoperative images ( note that in the following , when an imr image is defined by a number , this number is the index of the imr image in the series for a specific patient case .\nthe 1st imr image thus corresponds to the very first imr image of the series ) . as each imr image\nis acquired , this new image and the preceding imr image are used to estimate the deformation of the brain .\nthe update of the preoperative images is done incrementally with each new pair of successive imr images . for each pair , we proceed as follows . a set of common anatomical landmarks\nthe use of surface structures rather than volume structures   seems more appropriate given the reduced - quality of typical intraoperative images , and would be more easily adapted to intraoperative modalities other than imr , such as ius .\nthe landmark surface displacement fields resulting from the matching are then applied to the biomechanical model , which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the acquisition times of the imr images in the pair under consideration , namely , brain shift , or resection .\nthe resulting displacement field of the biomechanical model is finally used to warp the set of preoperative images in their current state of updating .\nnote that , for each deformation modeling , the biomechanical model is deformed in accordance with the landmark displacements tracked between the pair of successive imr images under consideration . because intraoperative deformation can follow a reverse direction , it is important to track the landmarks between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images , rather than track the landmarks between the first and the last acquired imr images . for the patient cases treated in section 5 , we assume that the brain undergoes relatively small deformations ( small strains and small displacements ) , and we use a linear finite - element formulation in the biomechanical model .\na consequence of using this linear formulation ( linear elasticity ) is that the equations of solid mechanics can be solved based on the initial configuration of the solid .\nactually , knowing the displacement field increment un = u  u at the anatomical landmarks between configuration n and increment n + 1 , one can apply this constrained displacement field increment un to the initial configuration , and the finite element analysis will lead to the deformation tensor increment n between the configuration n and n + 1 .\nthe final deformation tensor or the body is thus simply obtained from  = k=0k .\nremark that rigorously , the increment of constrained displacement field at the landmark should be applied to the balanced solution of the solid reached after increment n , but as we are using a linear elasticity model , this step can be skipped owing to the superposition principle : if  = c , then  = k=0k = ck=0k = c , where c is the hooke tensor . as a summary , with this approach ,\nthe process of deformations is modeled as a succession of deformations k , for example , brain deformation composed of shift followed by successive resections and the current configuration of the brain biomechanical model , after a specific deformation can then be recovered by adding the computed volume displacements for all successive incremental deformations . remark\nthat this is not a limitation of the method as we could easily extend it to nonlinear model by simply keeping in memory the previous deformed configuration n and adding the constrained displacement field increment un to compute the new deformed configuration at increment n + 1 , simply this would be less computationally efficient . because we use a linear formulation ( and , thus , the incremental volume displacement fields can be added to recover the current configuration of the biomechanical model ) , we could theoretically obtain an identical deformed configuration of the biomechanical model using the two following approaches .\nthe first one would consist of computing and adding the successive incremental deformations of the biomechanical model based on the landmarks tracked between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images .\nthe second approach would consist in computing directly the deformed configuration of the biomechanical model based on the landmarks tracked between the first and the last acquired imr images .\nhowever , the landmarks selected to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model vary depending on the type of deformation , namely , brain shift or resection .\nin addition , part of the biomechanical model is  cut ,  using xfem , to model resection .\nconsequently , we would not get an identical deformed configuration of the biomechanical model by these two approaches .\nin order to use a maximum of information from the imr images , we track , as explained for the first approach , the landmarks between the next - to - last and the last acquired imr images .\nthe problem of updating preoperative images between more than two critical points during surgery , that is , based on more than two imr images , is addressed in only a small number of studies . in our previous work [ 39 , 41 ] , and in\n, the biomechanical model was successively deformed , and this was done using a linear formulation .\nthe framework proposed here , where the initial biomechanical model is always used , instead of using it in its successive states of deformation , has the important advantage of using a good quality mesh for each deformation modeling rather than using a mesh whose quality progressively deteriorates with each successive deformation modeling , and which would require remeshing or mesh adaptation for getting back good fe quality . to summarize ,\nfor each deformation , the landmarks are tracked between the two successive imr images under consideration . because we use a linear formulation ,\nthe displacement fields of these landmarks are applied to the initial , rather than current , configuration of the biomechanical model .\nthe resulting volume displacement field corresponds to the deformation that the brain undergoes between the two imr images .\nthis volume displacement field is used to deform the preoperative images in their current state of update , that is , registered ( at the previous step , if any ) to the first imr image of the pair .\nafter the deformation , the preoperative images are thus in as good as possible registration to the second imr image of the pair . in all the rest of this work ,\nwe make a simplification of the approach just presented , by using the 1st imr image as a substitute for the preoperative images .\nthe biomechanical model is thus built based on structures visible in the 1st imr image , instead of in the preoperative images , and the structures used in the model are limited to the ones visible in the intraoperative image . except for the rigid registration between the preoperative images , the biomechanical model , and the 1st imr image , this simplified approach allows us to discuss , illustrate , and test all key aspects of the system .\nthe above strategy allows us to focus on the main issue of this paper , that is , the estimation and handling of 3d deformations .\neven though the issues involved in the update of preoperative images will need to be addressed in a operational image update system , the present strategy of deforming the imr images remains useful for calibration purpose , even in the operating room .\nthis section details the different methods that are commonly used for updating preoperative images in presence of brain shift and resection .\nmore specifically , the block diagram of figure 2(a ) shows the building of the biomechanical model from the preoperative images .\nspecific regions from the preoperative images are segmented , meshed , and assigned appropriate constitutive laws .\nthe block diagram of figure 2(b ) shows , for any pair of successive imr images , a detailed view of the calculation of the volume displacement field of the initial biomechanical model that corresponds to the deformation that has occurred between the acquisition time of these images . all along surgery , the patient is lying inside the 0.5 tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner .\nalthough the patient 's head is fixed , one can not totally rule out the possibility of slight head motion .\nimr images thus have to be rigidly coregistered to take into account this potential rigid motion .\nthe rigid registration that we use is the point - based landmark transform available in vtk ( http://www.vtk.org/ ) .\nthe segmentation of imr images into specific regions , for example , healthy - brain and tumor regions , is first performed manually using 3d slicer ( http://www.slicer.org/ ) and then smoothed to minimize the dependance of the results on segmentation roughness .\nit is clear that performing a manual segmentation in the operating room is not acceptable , and that this process needs to be automated as completely as possible to test the feasibility of our framework online .\nhowever , while there exist sophisticated segmentation algorithms that could be used [ 5052 ] , in particular for extracting the whole - brain region ( skull and external cerebrospinal fluid masked out ) , the segmentation of the tumor region is still challenging . as mentioned above , the biomechanical model is built , in the present context , from the 1st imr image rather than from the preoperative images . thanks to the use of xfem instead of fem for modeling discontinuities , this biomechanical model can be built offline before the operation starts and does not need to be repeated ( through remeshing ) during the surgery . with respect to fem - based approaches ,\nthe execution time thus ceases to be a limiting parameter , which is a remarkable advantage of our approach .\nit thus requires specific techniques , and we use the meshing software tool isosurf ( http://svr-www.eng.cam.ac.uk/~gmt11/software/isosurf/isosurf.html ) . our goal is to model the boundaries of healthy - brain and tumor regions as two connected surfaces meshes .\nhowever , isosurf can only mesh the boundaries of one or several separate regions , and , thus , does not allow one to mesh connected region boundaries with common nodes at their intersections .\nwe thus start by building two separate surfaces meshes that we connect using our own routines based on vtk .\nthe two connected triangle surfaces are then jointly meshed into a single volume mesh of tetrahedra that conform to the two surface meshes using gmsh ( http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/ ) .\nfurther details on the building of the biomechanical model , in particular the building of the connected surface meshes , can be found in .\na linear elastic law is assigned to the biomechanical model , with young modulus e = 3000  pa and poisson ratio  = 0.45 . because displacements , rather than forces , are applied to the model using a linear formulation , the fem or xfem solution is independent of young modulus e .\nwe choose as surface landmarks the whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries . to evaluate the surface deformations of these region boundaries between two imr images , we use an active surface algorithm [ 55 , 56 ] .\nbecause these region boundaries to match must be closed surfaces , we thus use as surface landmarks the whole - brain and healthy - brain region boundaries .\nthe surface deformation of the internal tumor region boundary will be derived from the active surface algorithm of the healthy - brain region boundary . in our active surface algorithm coming from [ 13 , 47 , 48 ] , the external forces f(x ) are computed using a gradient descent on a distance map of the region boundary . with such external forces , the active surface algorithm is not able to take correctly into account local rigid motion due , as an example , to lateral or tangential movement depending on the head orientation . for the whole - brain region , any rigid transformation that could have occurred\nhas already been taken into account by the rigid registration of the imr images ( section 4.1 ) . however , for the healthy - brain region , it can happen that the internal tumor region boundary moves partly in a rigid way .\ntherefore , the active surface , initialized from the healthy - brain region boundary in the first imr image , is first locally transformed in a rigid way along the internal tumor region boundary using the iterative closest point transform available in vtk .\nthen , this resulting surface is deformed using the active surface algorithm as explained above .\nfurther details on the local rigid registration of the healthy - brain region boundary can be found in . before applying the displacements whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries to the biomechanical model nodes ,\nthe two surface displacement fields are smoothed based on a weighted - distance average , that is , the displacement of each node is averaged with the displacements of its n closest neighbor nodes .\nthis smoothing will make them consistent with each other , and compatible with the volume mesh in order to avoid element flipping , in particular at the intersections between whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries .\nthe displacement fields of the surface landmarks are applied to the biomechanical model , which deforms according to the laws of solid mechanics .\nthe equations of solid mechanics are solved using fem or xfem , depending upon the type of circumstances , namely , brain shift or resection .\nwe use the fem - software tool metafor ( http://metafor.ltas.ulg.ac.be/ )   developed in our mechanical - engineering department , to which we have added an xfem module .\nthe initial stress state of the brain is unknown and is thus set to zero for each fem or xfem computation , as in [ 10 , 13 ] .\nfem discretizes the solid of interest into a mesh , that is , into a set of fes interconnected by nodes , and approximates the displacement field u(x ) by the fem displacement field u(x ) defined as \n ( 1)ufem(x)=iii(x)ui , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where i is the set of nodes , the i(x ) 's are the nodal shape functions ( nsfs ) , and the ui 's are the nodal degrees of freedom ( dofs ) .\neach i(x ) is defined as being continuous on its compact support i , which corresponds to the union of the domains of the fes connected to node i . in our approach , we use linear nsfs .\nin contrast , xfem handles a discontinuity by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within fes [ 37 , 5860 ] .\nthe xfem displacement field generalises the fem displacement field ( 1 ) with \n ( 2)uxfem(x)=iii(x)ui+iji(x)j=1neigj(x)aji . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nthe first term corresponds to the fem displacement field ( 1 ) , where i is the set of nodes , the i(x ) 's are the fem nsfs , and the ui 's are the nodal fem dofs . the heart of xfem is the  enrichment  that adds a number , n , of dofs aji to each node i of the set j , which is the subset of nodes of i whose support is intersected by the discontinuity of interest .\nthese dofs are multiplied by the nsfs i(x ) and the discontinuous functions gj(x ) .\nthe use of specific xfem enrichment functions gj(x ) for a node i  j depends on the type of discontinuity , for example , crack , hole , material interface , and so forth , to be modeled .\nsuppose that our goal is to model a crack , characterized by a discontinuity in the displacement field ( as opposed to a material interface for instance , characterized by a discontinuity in the derivative of the displacement field ) .\nwhen the crack fully intersects the support of the node , a simple choice is a piecewise - constant unit function that changes sign at the boundary across the crack , that is , the heaviside function \n ( 3)h(x)={1for  ( xx)en>0,1for  ( xx)en<0 , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where x is again the position of a point of the solid , x * is the position of the point on the crack that is the closest to x , and en is the outward normal to the crack at x * . in case of resection deformation , the goal is to model a discontinuity such that the part of tissues corresponding to tissue removed by the resection has no influence on the deformation of the remaining part of the tissues .\none is actually interested in the deformation of the remaining part of the tissues only . in that sense ,\nthe hole function    as the following equation :  \n ( 4)v(x)={1for  ( xx)en>0,0for  ( xx)en<0 , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t could be used as xfem enrichment function , instead of the heaviside function , and would be totally sufficient .\nthe results that we would obtain on the remaining part of the tissues would be identical .\nhowever , because the heaviside function is necessary for retraction modeling , we have used the same function for the resection modeling even if it was not strictly necessary . when minimizing the total deformation energy , the resulting xfem equations remain sparse and symmetric as for fem .\nwhereas fem requires a remeshing and the duplication of the nodes along the crack to take into account any discontinuity , xfem requires the identification of the nodes whose support is intersected by the crack and the addition of dofs : ( 1 ) any node whose support is not intersected by the discontinuity remains unaffected and thus possesses three dofs ; ( 2 ) any node whose support is fully intersected by the discontinuity is enriched with three heaviside dofs and thus possesses six dofs . to qualitatively estimate the similarity between two images , we compare the edges extracted from these images using the canny edge detector available in itk ( http://www.itk.org/ ) .  \nindeed , although potentially useful for the sake of comparing methods on a mathematical basis and defining unique correspondences , landmark - based target analysis presents several relevant limitations in the present setting . having experts picking landmarks introduces significant intra- and interobserver variability . picking landmark points , as ferrant et al .  \ndid , is rather difficult when it comes to define enough visible landmarks  especially in the tumor region  on the 5 different images ( and not 2 images only , as majority of studies focusing on brain shift are using ) . rather than point targets , linear tumor contours , and limits between structures and potential eloquent structures matter most in the practical case of tumor ablation neurosurgery . \n\t\t\t\t\t\nthese are the reason why we chose to use the canny edges in order to evaluate the registration . besides\n, while it is true that these edges do not necessarily physically correspond between the successive imr images , these images have been acquired with the same image protocol ( mr sequence , voxel size , grayscale value range ) , which should limit this problem .\nto quantitatively estimate the similarity of the two edge maps , we compute the modified hausdorff distance between the sets of edge points , that is , voxels representing the edges , in these two images .\nthe modified hausdorff distance (a , b )   between two sets of points a and b is defined as \n ( 5)(a , b)=max(h(a , b),h(b , a ) )  with  h(a , b)=1naaad(a , b ) , \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t where the directed hausdorff distance h(a , b ) is a measure of the distance of the point set a to the point set b , na is the number of points in set a , and d(a , b ) is the distance of point a  a to the closest point in b , that is , d(a , b ) = minbb||a  b|| , where ||a  b|| is the euclidean distance .\nthe directed hausdorff distance h(a , b ) thus computes the average distance of points of a to points of b. the averaging minimizes the effects of outlier points , for example , due to image noise .\nthe value of the modified hausdorff distance (a , b ) increases with the amount of difference between the two sets of edges points . in the following ,\nwe denote by (ia , ib ) the modified hausdorff distance of the edges extracted from the whole - brain region of the images ia and ib , that is , with the skull and external cerebrospinal fluid masked out from them .\nin this section , we apply our methods , respectively , of brain shift and resection ( imr images are acquired with the 0.5  tesla intraoperative ge signa scanner of the brigham and women 's hospital , boston , usa .\nimr image size is 256  256  60 voxels , and voxel size is 0.9375  0.9375  2.5  mm ) .\ntwo patient cases , each including five imr images , are treated to illustrate our modeling and brain shift followed by successive resections . in both cases , the 1st imr image was acquired prior to the opening of the skull ; the 2nd imr image was acquired after the opening of the skull and dura , and shows some brain shift ; the 3rd , 4th , and 5th imr images were acquired after successive resections .\nthe modelings of brain shift , 1st , 2nd , and 3rd resection are performed using different techniques , as detailed below . except where otherwise noted\n, the following discussion applies to both patient cases ( the result of each deformation modeling is shown for the two patient cases at the end of section 5.2.3 ) . to model brain shift based on the 1st and 2nd imr images\n, we estimate the surface displacement fields of the whole - brain region boundary and the internal tumor region boundary from the two imr images .\nno tissue discontinuity is involved in the brain shift deformation , so the biomechanical model is deformed using fem .\nthis results in the volume displacement field of the biomechanical model , which is illustrated in figure 3 for the first patient case .\nthis volume displacement field is used to warp the part of the 1st imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . in the following sections ,\nthe three successive resections are modeled separately , because they require different types of processing .\nmatching two region boundaries to get a displacement field makes sense only if they correspond to the same physical entity .\nonce the resection has started , we can no longer rely on the entirety of the whole - brain region boundary , since a part of it is now missing . for modeling the successive resections , we thus evaluate the displacement field for the boundary of the healthy - brain region only .\nthe 1st resection occurs between the times the 2nd and 3rd imr images are acquired .\nhowever , since the corresponding removal of tissues is most likely accompanied by deformation , one can not exactly determine what tissue is removed based just on the two imr images .\nwe thus decided to model the 1st resection by still relying on the displacement fields of key surfaces , here the healthy - brain region boundary , to deform the biomechanical model .\nthis indeed appears to be the only reliable information concerning the deformation due to resection that we can extract from the 2nd and 3rd imr images .\nconsequently , we do not model explicitly the removal of tissue , but we model directly the deformation resulting from it , without introducing any tissue discontinuity . using the surface displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary , we compute the deformation of the biomechanical model via fem . then , using the resulting volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 2nd imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region , in the same way as we did in the case of for brain shift .\nthe image resulting from the 1st resection modeling is now registered to the 3rd imr image , except outside of the healthy - brain region boundary , that is , for the tumor region . finally , we alter the resulting image to reflect the effect of resection . for this\n, we assign the background color to the voxels corresponding to the resected tissue volume \nthe significant feature of the 2nd resection is that some tissue has already been removed by the 1st resection , which means that this tissue can not have any physical influence on subsequent brain deformations because it does not \nrecall that the biomechanical model has been deformed to model the brain shift and the 1st resection and is thus registered to the 3rd imr image .\nso , using the 3rd imr image , we can define the boundary of the 1st resection , that is , the tissue discontinuity to include in the deformed biomechanical model ( figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) ) .\nwe then enrich the nodes whose supports are intersected by the discontinuity with heaviside dofs .\nconsequently , when the xfem - based biomechanical model deforms , the part corresponding to tissue removed by the 1st resection has no influence on the deformation of the remaining part of the brain .\nfor the first patient case illustrated in figure 4 , the tetrahedron mesh consists of 3,317 nodes , which corresponds to 9,951 fem dofs .\nthe biomechanical model is deformed in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary evaluated from the 3rd and 4th imr images .  \nthe bottom part of the mesh , representing the tissue remaining after the 1st resection , has been deformed according to the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary , while the top part , representing the tissue removed by the 1st resection , has been subjected to a translation , but only for visualization purposes . even though the mesh is displayed as two separate parts , it is , in fact , a single entity .\nindeed , a main feature of xfem is its ability to handle the effect of a discontinuity without modifying the underlying mesh , that is , without remeshing . for modeling the 2nd resection , the edges of fes straddling the discontinuity\nhave been made discontinuous and their nodes moved apart . using the xfem volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 3rd imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region .\nthe resulting image is then masked out with the whole - brain region segmented out from the 4th imr image .\none significant feature of the procedure described for modeling the 2nd resection is that it can be applied repetitively for each subsequent resection visible on successive imr images , no matter how many there are .\nthe modeling of the 3rd resection is thus identical to the modeling of the 2nd resection .\nthe tissue discontinuity due to the 2nd resection is defined from the 4th imr image , and used to appropriately enrich the nodes of the biomechanical model .\nthen , this biomechanical model is deformed using xfem , in accordance with the displacement field of the healthy - brain region boundary evaluated from the 4th and 5th imr images . for the first patient case ,\na simplification for the modeling of the 3rd resection can be made because , by the time the 5th imr image is acquired , the resection is complete .\nthis means that we only need to compute the volume displacement field of the healthy - brain region .\nsince we apply displacements exactly to the boundary of the healthy - brain region , the results obtained with fem and xfem will be identical .\nusing the fem ( for the first patient case ) or xfem ( for the second patient case ) volume displacement field , we warp the part of the 4th imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region . the resulting image is then masked out with the whole - brain region segmented out from the 5th imr image .\nfigures 5 and 6 show the results of warping the imr images , as well as the edges extracted from them , after brain shift and each successive resection modeling for the two patient cases . as explained in section 5.2.3 , since we apply displacements exactly to the boundary of the healthy - brain region , the results obtained with fem and xfem are identical in the healthy - brain region .\none can deduce that using xfem for modeling resection is interesting when the neurosurgeon needs to have an accurate displacement field of the remaining tumor tissues . in this case\n, it is interesting to evaluate the impact of using fem , instead of xfem , to model the resection as if no resection was performed before .\nusing fem for modeling resection is equivalent to ignoring the presence of resection on intraoperative images . to illustrate the comparison between fem and xfem results , we choose the 3rd resection modeling of the second patient case\nindeed , it is the deformation with remaining tumor tissues that shows the largest magnitude , and , thus , that is likely to give a maximum difference between the two computations .  \nthe healthy - brain and tumor regions segmented out from the 4th and 5th imr images are respectively shown in figures 7(a ) and 7(b ) .\nthe volume displacement fields of the biomechanical model using xfem and fem are respectively shown in figures 7(c ) and 7(d ) .\nthe part of the 4th imr image corresponding to the whole - brain region is warped , first with the volume displacement field obtained via fem , and then with that obtained via xfem .\nthe difference between the two warped images is shown in figure 7(e ) . as expected\nhowever , the difference between the two volume displacement fields is smaller than the image resolution ( although the difference between the two volume displacement fields is smaller than the image resolution , the difference between the images resulting of the warping using these two volume displacement fields is nonzero .\nthis is explained by the fact that the ( gray ) value of each voxel of the warped image is defined as a weighted - value of voxels of the original image .\nthe weights are defined based on the overlapping ratio of the voxel of the warped image , with voxels ( determined using the volume displacement field ) of the original image ) .\nin addition , the deformed 4th imr images , using the xfem- and the fem - based deformations of the biomechanical model , show the same similarity , computed based on the modified hausdorff distance , with the 5th imr .\ntwo reasons explain that the differences between the fem and xfem results are so small .\nfirst , the brain deformation itself due to the 3rd resection is small , and , thus , it is expected to obtain small differences between the two resulting brain deformations .\nsecond , in the case the remaining tumor tissues are close to the healthy - brain region boundary , it implies that they are close to the boundary where surface displacement fields are applied to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model .\nalthough this comparison between fem and xfem should be done on more patient cases , we suggest that , in first approximation , fem could be used for modeling resection cases with small brain deformations .\nnevertheless , the presentation of the successive resections using xfem shows the generality of our framework , and details how xfem is implemented .\nnote that in section 6 devoted to validation , the warped images are the ones deformed with xfem .\nfor each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images that are already rigidly registered , we compare the similarity between these ik and ik+1 images , as well as the similarity between the ik and ik+1 images , where ik is the result of warping ik .\nthis gives us an estimate of how well we are able to capture , and compensate for , the local deformations between ik and ik+1 .\nthe goal of the nonrigid registration is , however , to deform the preoperative images . by warping ik for each deformation modeling\n, we do not take into account the fact that an error of alignment after each deformation modeling could propagate and amplify through the successive deformation modelings . to evaluate the effect of this error amplification on the results\n, we also perform the required succession of warpings on i1 , and we denote the resulting image by i1,k .\nwe then compare , for each deformation modeling , the similarity between i1 and ik+1 , together with the similarity between i1,k and ik+1 .\nthis allows one to evaluate the propagation , that is , the amplification , of alignment error on the results .\nthe modified hausdorff distance computed for each pair of imr images are given in tables 1 and 2 . \n\ntable 1 shows , for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images , the values of the modified hausdorff distances (ik , ik+1 ) and (ik , ik+1 ) .\nthese values are computed using the canny edges extracted from the pair of images ( ik , ik+1 ) ( figures 5 ( d ) and 6 ( d ) ) and ( ik , ik+1 ) ( figures 5 ( e ) and 6 ( e ) ) .\nwe observe that the values for the images nonrigidly registered are relatively constant , that is , 1  mm , for each deformation modeling .\nsix out of eight deformation modelings give smaller modified hausdorff distances when the imr images are ( rigidly and subsequently ) nonrigidly registered .\nhowever , the modified hausdorff distance increases for the 3rd resection modeling of the first patient case , as well as for the brain shift modeling of the second patient case . to understand\nif the nonrigid registration is responsible for the increase of the misalignment of the two imr images everywhere in the whole - brain region , or if this effect is localized , we compute the modified hausdorff distance in the region and neighborhood of the tumor only ( volume region that extents by 25  mm the tumor region segmented in i1 for both patient cases ) .\nthe modified hausdorff distance decreases from (i4 , i5 ) = 1.70  mm to (i4 , i5 ) = 1.37  mm for the first patient case , while it decreases from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.36  mm to (i1 , i2 ) = 1.28  mm for the second patient case .\nthis indicates that the nonrigid registration enhances the alignment of the two imr images within the tumor region and its neighborhood , which is in fact the location requiring the best modeling accuracy .\nthis behavior could be explained by the fact that a maximum of information from the imr images is used in this region , that is , one or two ( in case of brain shift modeling ) surface displacement fields are applied around it .\nthe increase of misalignment elsewhere in the brain volume could be explained by two reasons .\nfirst , the landmarks tracked from the imr images are surfaces . as a consequence , the nonrigid registration is expected to give better results near the tracked surfaces than far from them in the volume .\nthe volume misalignment could point out the need for better parameters values and/or other constitutive laws . \n\ntable 2 shows , for each deformation modeling based on a pair ( ik , ik+1 ) of two successive imr images , the values of the modified hausdorff distances (i1 , ik+1 ) and (i1,k , ik+1 ) .\nso far , igns systems allow one to rigidly register preoperative and successive imr images .\n(i1 , ik+1 ) thus represents the navigation accuracy that we can obtain with an igns system at the present time .\nthe comparison of (i1 , ik+1 ) with (i1,k , ik+1 ) gives the improvement that could be practically achieved in the alignment with our approach .\nas expected , table 2 shows that the igns accuracy decreases through the successive deformations .\nindeed , the modified hausdorff distance increases from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.24  mm to (i1 , i5 ) = 1.78  mm for the first patient case , and from (i1 , i2 ) = 1.01  mm to (i1 , i5 ) = 1.68  mm for the second patient case .\nsix out of eight deformation modelings give smaller modified hausdorff distances when the imr images are nonrigidly registered .\nto understand if the modified hausdorff distance increases everywhere in the whole - brain region for the brain shift and 1st resection modeling of the second patient case , we compute the modified hausdorff distance in the neighborhood of the tumor region ( in the same way as explained for table 1 ) , and observe the improvement of the alignment within the tumor region and its neighborhood . as opposed to the values of the modified hausdorff distances in table 1 , the values for the images nonrigidly registered in table 2 increase through the successive resection modeling .\nthis amplification error is due to the fact that , after having modeled brain deformation between a pair of imr images , the deformed biomechanical model is not in perfect alignment with the second image of the pair .\nsince , for the subsequent deformation modeling , the surface landmarks are initialized based on the deformed biomechanical model , this can thus ampliy a misregistration error .\nwe developed a complete 3d framework for serial preoperative image update in the presence of brain shift followed by successive resections .\nthe nonrigid registration technique used an homogeneous linear elastic biomechanical model , driven by the deformations of whole - brain and internal tumor region boundaries for brain shift modeling , and healthy - brain region boundary for resection modelings , tracked between successive imr images .\nthe biomechanical model was deformed using fem for brain shift modeling , and fem or xfem for resection modeling , depending upon whether some brain tissues were previously resected or not .\nwe showed that our approach was modular , and could be applied each time a new imr image is acquired .\nwe used a linear formulation to characterize the deformation of the brains of both patients because the brains underwent relatively small deformations and displacements .\nwhile nonlinear biomechanical models have proven effective to decrease  yet do not abolish  the inaccuracies of fem - based modeling methods of large brain deformations , the deformations observed in our patients during surgery remained moderate ( 47  mm ) , thus reducing the theoretical benefit of using nonlinear models .\nthis allowed us to use simpler linear models and focus on the added value of xfem to simultaneously account for surgical deformations , namely , shift and resection . using a linear formulation\nimplied that , for each new deformation modeling , one could use the initial configuration rather than the last - deformed configuration of the biomechanical model .\nthis had the important advantage of using a good quality mesh for each deformation modeling rather than using a mesh whose quality progressively degraded with each successive deformation modeling .\nthis also had the advantage that we did no longer need to reconnect the deformed mesh for each new xfem calculation , which was one drawback of our previous method , presented in [ 39 , 41 ] , where the biomechanical model was successively deformed .\nwe also showed how xfem could handle a discontinuity for modeling resection without any remeshing or mesh adaptation while the representation of the discontinuity remained accurate , that is , the representation of the discontinuity was not based on a jagged topology using fe facets .\nxfem thus also avoided making the mesh resolution richer in the neighborhood of the resection - cavity boundary for improving the accuracy of the representation of the discontinuity for that purpose only .\nwe showed that our nonrigid registration technique improved the alignment of the successive imr images for most of the deformation modeling of both patient cases . when our nonrigid registration failed , it still improved the alignment locally , that is , within the tumor region and its neighborhood .\nwe tested the explicit modeling of the lateral ventricles ' region with a soft , compressible law in addition to the whole - brain region law used in the homogeneous biomechanical model .\nin addition to the validation that is usually performed for successive deformation modelings , that is , validation between pairs of successive intraoperative images , shown in table 1 of section 6 or in the work of ferrant et al .\n[ 13 , 47 , 48 ] , we also evaluated the fact that an error of alignment after each deformation modeling could propagate and amplify through the successive deformation modelings . as a result , shown in table 2 of section 6\n, we showed that our approach suffered from the propagation of misregistration through the successive deformation modelings .\nwe expected that this was due , at least partly , to the algorithms used to evaluate intraoperative surface displacements fields from the whole - brain and healthy - brain region boundaries .\nthe surface displacement fields were computed using active surface algorithms , and smoothed to make them compatible with the biomechanical model .\nbecause of these two smoothings , the deformed biomechanical model was likely to not be in a perfect alignment with the imr image to which it was registered .\nbecause the surface displacement fields evaluated for the next deformation modeling were initialized based on the deformed biomechanical model , we expected to observe an amplification of the misregistration , which was confirmed by our quantitative evaluation . at the present time\nthough , commercial igns systems allow one to register preoperative images and successive imr images , but in a rigid way only .\nconsequently , although the effect of error amplification exists , our technique still enhances the current capabilities of commercial igns systems .\nfuture work on modeling of brain shift followed by successive resection is required in five main areas .\nfirst , the effect of error amplification through the successive brain deformation modelings calls for further research .\nconsequently , the segmentation , and the subsequent smoothing , as well as the evaluation of surface displacement fields , should be improved to minimize the effect of error amplification .\nsecond , further research is required to include additional structures in the biomechanical model in general , and to study the best way to include the lateral ventricles in particular .\nthe use of a poroelastic model in order to model the cerebrospinal fluid filling the ventricles could be considered [ 17 , 18 ] .\nindeed , these images provide volume information ( rather than surface information only ) , are of good quality in comparison to other intraoperative modalities , and possess a field of view that includes the full volume of brain tissues ( for the 0.5 tesla ge signa scanner ) .\nthese images thus allow one to evaluate what , and how , new structures of the brain could be used , to enhance the modeling of brain shift .\nsome regions , for example , the lateral ventricles ' region , could be extracted from the two imr images , and used as surface landmarks to drive the deformation of the biomechanical model [ 13 , 62 ] . indeed , the workflow presented in this paper has the advantage of being easily adaptable . in case\nthe tumor region would not be visible ( enough ) on the imr images , these new structures , easier to segment , could also adequately replace the tumor for driving the deformation .\nfourth , our global approach should no longer be based on the 1st imr image used as a substitute for preoperative images , but on the preoperative images themselves .\nfifth , we should implement , for the surgery cases involving large deformations of the brain , a nonlinear formulation of fem [ 63 , 64 ] , and , particularly , a nonlinear formulation of xfem , which is the subject of recent research [ 65 , 66 ] ."}
{"id": 44, "text": "the contribution to human health of the specific fatty acid ( fa ) composition of the diet has received considerable attention in the literature .\nfatty acids are key nutrients that affect early growth and development as well as the prevention of chronic disease in later life.1 among the fas , omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3 pufa ) and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-6 pufa ) have been suggested to decrease and increase several human diseases , respectively .\npufa that contains more than one carbon double bond consists of two major classes such as n-6 and n-3 ( fig .\nlinoleic acid ( la ) is a representative n-6 pufa , serving as a substrate to be converted into an arachidonic acid ( aa ) affecting the prevalence and severity of inflammation .\nn-6 pufa can induce cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cancer , and age - related disease.1 \n -linolenic acid ( ala ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa 20:5 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha 22:6 ) are important n-3 pufa involved in human .\nthey are essential fatty acids that can not be synthesized by mammals , by which must be obtained from dietary sources such as cold - water fish , certain seeds ( flax ) and nuts ( walnuts ) .\na lot of studies suggest that n-3 pufa , as diet - dependent factors , may be critical to preventing disease backed up with authentic antioxidative and anti - inflammatory actions . especially , n-3\npufa has been shown to exert beneficial effects on some chronic degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular disease,2,3 rheumatoid arthritis,4 diabetes,5 other autoimmune diseases,6,7 and cancer.8,9 increased fat consumption by western diet has been associated with the development of cancer such as breast , colon , pancreatic , and prostate cancers with the notable exception of n-3 pufa , which show to have multiple beneficial anti - tumor actions that affect the essential alterations that dictate malignant growth in a number of studies.10 a diet rich in n-3 pufa may protect from cancer , at least at certain sites .\nstudies on the fatty acid status of patients with several cancer types including bladder , pancreatic , lung and esophageal cancer show low concentrations of plasma phospholipid n-3 pufa , ranging from 55 to 88% of amounts in healthy individuals.1113 recent studies have found a positive association between n-6 pufa and cancer risk , whereas in the same model , n-3 pufa were shown to reduce the development of cancer .\nepidemiological studies suggest that a high n-3 pufa to n-6 pufa ratio may be the optimal strategy to decrease breast cancer risk.14 solid epidemiological study shows that consumption of n-3 pufa appears to protect against the development of hepatocellular carcinoma , even among patients with hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) and/or hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection.15 recently , zhennan et al .\nhas reviewed prospective studies investigating the possible protective effects of the dietary intake of n-3 pufa on prostate cancer development.16 fasano et al also has reviewed a lot of in vivo and in vitro experimental studies providing strong indications of the anti - tumor action of n-3 pufa against lung cancer.17 the purpose of this review is to discuss the potential role of n-3 pufa in gastrointestinal ( gi ) cancer development .\nwe believe that increased consumption of n-3 pufa may lower the risk of gi cancer development via various chemopreventive activities .\nfuture studies should include combination treatment of n-3 pufa and nutrients with different and complementary mechanisms of chemopreventive action .\namong various cancers , most of the gi cancers including esophageal cancer , stomach cancer , and colon cancer , have a natural history of multi - step transition from precursor lesions to malignant lesions , inflammation , adenoma formation , dysplastic changes.18 therefore , gi cancers usually have premalignant lesions before developing invasive cancers , for instances , barrett s esophagus for esophageal cancer , chronic atrophic gastritis accompanied with intestinal metaplasia for gastric cancer , and adenoma or dysplasia originating from chronic ulcerative colitis for colon cancer .\nbecause the western diet contains disproportionally high amounts of n-6 pufa and low amounts of n-3 pufa , denoted as a high n-6 to n-3 pufa ratio , n-3 pufa may feasibly play a role in several stages of gi cancers management .\nesophageal cancer is ranked as the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide . according to the increasing incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) ,\nesophageal cancer is a tumor that has increased in incidence more than 7-fold over the past several decades .\nsuggests that negative associations between n-3 pufa intake and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.19 higher in - takes of n-3 pufa [ cases vs. population controls ; or=0.46 , 95% ci=0.220.97 , 4th vs. 1st quartiles of intake ] was associated with a lower risk of barrett s esophagus .\nin contrast , higher trans - fat intakes were associated with increased risk ( or=1.11 ; 95% ci=1.031.21 per g / day ) .\nmoreover , it is reported that n-3 pufa supplemented parenteral nutrition can reduce inflammation and improve immune function in patients following esophageal cancer surgery20 and n-3 pufa - containing diet may be beneficial to patients with esophageal cancers who receive chemoradiation therapy ( crt ) by reducing crt toxicity.21 in contrast to other gi cancer , little work has so far been performed on the influence of n-3 pufa in oesophageal adenocarcinogenesis and neoplastic progression.22 there is a need for appropriately powered randomized -

tumor actions .\ncurrent knowledge of the anti - tumor activity of n-3 pufa has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere.9,16,39 recently , stephenson et al.10 has reviewed more recent underlying mechanisms providing strong indications of the anti - tumor actions of n-3 pufa on the hallmarks of cancer .\nn-3 pufa appear to down - regulate epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , protein kinase c ( pkc ) , ras , and nf-b , insulin like growth factor ( igf ) , which are important cell signaling mediators often found to be elevated in carcinogenesis .\nsecondly , n-3 pufa induces cancer cell apoptosis via modulation of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppars ) , the bcl-2 family , and nf-b cell signaling .\nthirdly , n-3 pufa decreases sprouting angiogenesis by suppressing vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf)- and platelet derived growth factor ( pdgf)-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation , migration , and tube formation and by inhibition of mmps via no production and nf-b and -catenin cell signaling .\nfourthly , n-3 pufa also decreases cell - cell adhesion via down regulation of rho - gtpase , which inhibits cytoskeleton reorganisation , and reduction in intercellular adhesion molecule ( icam)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule ( vcam)-1 expression .\ncockbain et al.9 has also proposed the four main anti - tumor actions of n-3 pufa ( i ) modulation of cox activity ; ( ii ) alteration of membrane dynamics and cell surface receptor function ; ( iii ) increased cellular oxidative stress and ( iiii ) derived anti - inflammatory lipid mediators .\nfirstly , n-3 pufa can act as an alternative substrate for cox-2 , instead of aa , leading to a reduction in formation of pro - tumorigenic \nsecondly , incorporation of n-3 pufa into cell membranes alters the fluidity , structure and/or function of lipid rafts or calveolae .\nespecially , the localization of cell surface receptors , such as g protein - coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) , toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) , in lipid rafts is believed to be crucial for downstream receptor signaling , controlling proliferation and apoptosis .\nthirdly , n-3 pufa may have an anti - tumor effect through alteration in the cellular redox state .\nn-3 pufa can increase reactive oxygen species ( ros ) because it is highly peroxidisable .\ntherefore , n-3 pufa can induce cancer cell apoptosis via elevation of intracellular ros levels .\nfourthly , n-3 pufa can be metabolized novel anti - inflammatory lipid mediators including resolvins , protectins and maresins .\nit is known that resolvins exhibit antineoplastic activity via anti - inflammatory and inflammation resolution activity in animal models of acute inflammation . besides these multiple anti - tumor actions\n, it is also reported recently that n-3 pufa can activate nrf2 and induced nrf2-directed gene expression40,41 and can suppress lipopolysaccharide - induced inflammation through induction of nrf2 expression.42 nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) is a redox - sensitive master regulatory transcriptional factor that plays an important protective role in cells by regulating cellular redox balance.43 moreover , n-3 pufa significantly reduces oxidative stress - induced endothelial cell ca influx .\nthis effect might be associated , at least in part , with altered lipid composition in membrane lipid rafts.44 recently , the engineered n-3 pufa desaturase transgenic mice ( fat-1 mice ) , which can endogenously synthesize n-3 pufa in their tissues , allows carefully controlled studies to be performed in the absence of potential confounding dietary factors.45 the synthesis of n-3 pufa is achieved through the expression of the fat-1 transgene encoding for an n-3 desaturase , which utilizes n-6 pufa as substrate .\nthis allows production of high n-3/n-6 ratios in the animals , thus eliminating the potential diet variations .\nhence , the fat-1 transgenic mouse is a valuable in vivo system for elucidating the role of n-3 pufa in carcinogenesis .\nsince fat-1 mice were generated , xia et al.46 showed that melanoma formation and growth are reduced in fat-1 transgenic mice .\nnowak and jia47,48 reported that lower incidence and growth rate of colon tumors induced by dss ( dextrane sodium sulfate ) plus aom ( azoxymethane ) in the fat-1 transgenic mice via its anti -

risk patients via various mechanisms mediating cancer prevention by n-3 pufa ( fig .\n2 ) . in addition , using n-3 pufa in combination with other agents with complementary antitumor action may improve their efficacy in gi cancer prevention . recently ,\nmanson et al . has started the vitamin d and omega-3 trial ( vital ) , a large randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 22 factorial trial of vitamin d and n-3 pufa supplements in the primary prevention of cancer among a multi - ethnic population of 20,000 u.s .\nmen aged 50 and women aged 55.56 we expect that new findings in combination consumption of n-3 pufa with other nutrients will provide new approaches to public health implications with regard to prevention of gi cancer through dietary and lifestyle interventions ."}

these were analyzed for implant migration , acromioclavicular joint pathology ( degeneration , instability ) , subacromial changes ( degeneration , osteolysis ) , acromiohumeral interval measurement ( normal interval = 7 mm or more ) , peri - coracoid changes ( abnormal bone formation ) , and glenohumeral changes .\nin addition , in those cases where implant had been previously removed , past radiographs were obtained from the records and individually analyzed as described above .\nthe follow - up ultrasonographic protocol included evaluation of the acromioclavicular joint , subacromial space , glenohumeral joint , bicipital groove and biceps long tendon , and suprascapular and spinoglenoid notches ; ultrasound assessment was performed by a senior radiologist experienced in shoulder ultrasound .\nstatistical analysis was performed using a statistical software ( spss inc , chicago , usa ) to determine mean values and range of measured parameters of the overall and implant specific groups .\nsignificant differences between clinical and radiological parameters were determined using the non - parametric mann - whitney / wilcoxon rank - sum test for numerical data , and the fisher 's exact test for categorical data .\nthe average age of the patients in the study group was 34.5 years ( range , 20 to 57 years ) .\nthe mechanism of injury was a direct impact to the ipsilateral shoulder sustained during a fall ; in 8 patients , the fracture was sustained during a cycling - related sporting activity ( competitive or recreational ) .\nten patients were operated using a joint - spanning implant ( group 1 ) and 5 were operated using a joint - sparing implant technique ( group 2 ) .\nthe mean follow - up period was 26.1 months ( range , 12 to 40 months ) .\nthe overall and group - specific clinico - radiological outcomes and the types and distribution of fracture patterns are summarized in table 1 .\noverall and group.specific clinico.radiological outcomes and fracture patterns clinical outcomes : the mean cs was marginally higher in group 2 , while the mean sst score was marginally higher in group 1 ; none of these differences were statistically significant .\nacromioclavicular joint signs were positive in half of the group 1 patients , and in none in group 2 ; however , the walch scores for the acromioclavicular joint were not significantly different for the two groups .\nreturn to pre - operative level of recreational and competitive sports was seen in approximately two - thirds of the patients of group 1 , and all patients of group 2 ; this difference was not found to be statistically significant .\nreoperation rates related to implant removal were significantly higher ( p < 0.05 ) in group 1 patients ( 90 % ) as compared to group 2 ( 0% ) .\nradiographic outcomes [ figure 2a - d ] : radiographic union was observed in 93.3% of fractures ( 9 in group 1 , 5 in group 2 ) with only one non - union with subsequent fragment resorption ( group 1 ) .\nradiographic acromioclavicular joint degeneration was present in 3 patients ( group 1 ) ; all 3 patients had a clinically symptomatic ac joint .\nradiographic acromioclavicular joint superior subluxation was present in 4 patients ( group 1 = 1 patient , 10% ; group 2 = 3 patients , 60% ) ; none of these were clinically symptomatic .\nsubacromial osteolysis and hook migration were seen in 5 patients ( group 1 ) ; implant removal was necessary in 4 of these 5 patients , and at final follow - up , resolution of the radiographic subacromial osteolytic lesions was observed .\nsigns of progressive implant loosening ( screws and/or plate disengagement ) were seen in 3 patients ( group 1 ) .\nabnormal bone formation was present in 7 patients ( group 1 = 6 , group 2 = 1 ) .\n( b ) acromioclavicular joint subluxation ( arrows ) , ( c ) hook migration and osteolysis of acromial undersurface ( arrow ) , ( d ) peri - coracoid ossification ( arrows ) .\n( ac : acromion , cl : clavicle , co : coracoid , p : plate , an : suture anchor , g : glenoid , h : humeral head , hk : hook plate , ahi : acromiohumeral interval ) ultrasonographic outcomes [ figure 3a and b ] : supraspinatus lesions were seen in 3 patients ; these included partial articular - side tears ( group 1 = 1 patient , 10% ; group 2 = 1 patient , 20% ) , and supraspinatus bursal - side degenerative changes ( group 1 = 1 patient , 10% ) .\nacromioclavicular joint screw penetration was observed in 1 patient ( group 2 ) ; this penetration was not apparent on plain radiographs and the patient was asymptomatic at the final follow - up .\nno abnormalities were detected in the subacromial bursa on static ultrasound evaluation ; dynamic testing revealed abnormal subacromial bursal \" bunching \" with arm abduction in 2 patients ( group 1 = 1 , group 2 = 1 ) .\n( a ) partial articular - surface supraspinatus tendon avulsion ( black arrows ) ( b ) screw penetration into the acromioclavicular joint ( arrows ) .\n( gt : greater tuberosity , h : humeral head , ss : supraspinatus , ac : acromion , cl : clavicle , asterix : acromioclavicular joint ) radiographic evaluation of fracture comminution revealed 5 non - comminuted fractures ( group 1 = 2 , group 2 = 3 ) , and 10 comminuted fractures ( group 1 = 8 , group 2 = 2 ) .\nanalysis of the fracture lines and fragment cortices revealed repetitive patterns in the fracture geometry , and four types could be identified : ( i ) type 1 pattern ( n = 5 , 33% ) involved a clean vertical or a short oblique type bicortical fracture line without any comminution [ figure 4a ] , ( ii ) type 2 pattern ( n = 4 , 27% ) involved a zone of segmental comminution , between intact bicortical lateral and medial fragments [ figure 4b ] , ( iii ) type 3 pattern ( n = 5 , 33% ) involved propogation of at least one fracture line into the juxta - articular cortex of the ac joint [ figure 4c ] and ( iv ) type 4 pattern ( n = 1 , 7% ) consisted of fracture line propogation into the acromioclavicular joint [ figure 4d ] .\nradiographic fracture patterns : ( a ) type 1 , ( b ) type 2 , ( c ) type 3 , and ( d ) type 4 .\n( ac : acromion , cl : clavicle , co : coracoid , g : glenoid , h : humeral head , arrows : fracture lines )\nthe present study is the first study that describes overall and comparative outcomes ( clinical , radiographic , and ultrasonographic ) of surgical treatment of an uncommon lateral clavicular bony - ligamentous injury with joint - spanning and joint - sparing implants .\nin addition , four radiographic patterns of bone injury were identified to develop guidelines for choice of implants in these injuries . clinical outcomes and union rates after operative treatment of this injury\nare satisfactory , and this has been shown in other studies in literature . in the present study , both types of implants resulted in satisfactory and comparable clinical outcome scores , irrespective of the radiographic outcomes .\nhowever , a significant difference in the reoperation rate for implant removal ( p < 0.05 ) in patients treated with a joint - spanning implant probably implies that a joint - sparing implant could be preferentially used whenever fracture geometry permits .\nradiological outcomes , especially those associated with joint sparing techniques , have not been well documented in other studies .\nsubluxation of the acromioclavicular joint , ( present in 60% of group 2 patients ) may be related to either concomitant injury to the acromioclavicular ligaments , or to a partial failure of the coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction ; transfer of distraction forces to ac ligaments after fracture union may then induce gradual subluxation of this joint .\nthis complication was rare in the other group , probably due to the joint spanning implant design ; however , other radiological abnormalities like hook migration , subacromial osteolysis , implant loosening , and new bone formation were frequent .\nthe acromioclavicular joint spanning hook plate is a commonly used implant , and most studies have utilized this as the sole implant of choice .\nalthough clinical outcomes in these studies have been satisfactory , the effect of the subacromial hook on bursal tissues has been debated and use of the distal clavicle plate suggested . by using ultrasonographic evaluation , this study demonstrated the safety of the joint - spanning hook plate in relation to rotator cuff and subacromial bursa .\npersistent pain in the post - operative period probably resulted from acromial undersurface irritation ; early plate removal after fracture union is recommended , and long - term clinical outcomes seem to be satisfactory after implant removal .\nan important finding of this study is the grouping of the radiographic fracture patterns into four surgically relevant types .\ntypes 1 and 2 are ideal indications for use of a joint - sparing implant ; adequate bone stock in the distal fragment in these types will theoretically permit secure fixation across the fracture site . in types 3 and 4\n, inadequate distal fragment size may not permit secure bicortical fixation , thereby necessitating use of joint - spanning implants .\n. the retrospective nature and small sample size does not permit identification of all possible fracture configurations , and statistical analysis may differ with larger numbers .\nhowever , the clinical results are similar to other literature studies that have analyzed joint - spanning implants . also , the current radiographic patterns described provide guidelines for implant choice , and are not intended to be used as a prognostic classification .\nwe attribute the small size of the study group to the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria that eliminated several other patients with lateral clavicle fractures , and this was necessary to obtain meaningful conclusions\n. lateral clavicle fractures with complete disruption of the coracoclavicular ligaments should be regarded as a distinct entity that is perhaps biomechanically and prognostically different from similar fractures with partial ligament disruption .\na combination of a locking distal radius plate with coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction resulted in stable fixation and significantly lower reoperation rates , and should be used preferentially in lesser comminuted fractures ( types 1 and 2 ) ."}

assisted minimally invasive techniques began in urology , general surgery , and gynecology because of the generally large working spaces available in the abdomen for these types of surgeries [ 14 ] .\nsince then , other surgeons have sought to use robotic devices in other areas , such as the brachial plexus [ 5 , 6 ] .\nbrachial plexus dysfunction can be the result of shoulder trauma [ 7 , 8 ] .\nit can also occur with tos , which encompasses three separate disorders involving compression of the subclavian artery , subclavian vein , or brachial plexus in the triangular space bordered by the first rib , clavicle , and scalene muscles [ 9 , 10 ] .\ncompression of the vessel -

{"id": 51, "text": "older people have particular spiritual needs that are distinct from those of others , particularly in times of ill health and death and dying .\nit has been reported that spirituality has a positive effect on health outcomes and welfare of the elderly .\nnowadays , aging phenomenon and relevant problems with its complexities are important issues that have attracted the attention of social and medical scientists to investigate the spiritual needs of the elderly .  \nspiritual health is a dimension of health that is portrayed as the validation of life in relation to god , fellow human beings , and the environment .\nspirituality is the representative of the basic values that guide a person in searching to find answers to the crucial questions of life , such as the purpose and meaning of life , reality , love , good and bad , disease , and death .   over the past three decades , spirituality , religion , and prayer\nhave turned into a subject of large interest for researchers in medicine , nursing , gerontology , physical health and mental health disciplines , often in conjunction with complementary and alternative medicine .\nthis tendency has been stimulated by research demonstrating physical and psychological benefits of spiritual and religious involvements .  \nin fact , approximately 96% of adults in the united states expressed their belief in god , and 72% of identified religion and spirituality as having the most important influence in their lives . saying prayers is a regular daily task for muslims which begins at the age of puberty and continues throughout the life .\nit is a time getting rid of the material world and approaching the world beyond , as well as , to the inner self . in iran , elderly people are more religious than younger ones , and this is a norm of this culture .\na recent national survey of the iranians values and attitudes found that over 80% of the iranians practice prayer regularly as a part of their religion .\none might argue that this is a true reflection of individual culture where prayer and religious beliefs are a part of people 's everyday life .\nhowever , prayer can go beyond just performing a religious duty , and based on one 's wishes , take different forms of formal and informal practices .\nit has been shown that disease prevalence , incidence and mortality rates differ from one population to another .\nthis is partly ascribed to their disparities in lifestyle , dietary habits and other characteristics that are somehow affected by culture , especially religious traditions and experiences .   during the past two decades\nsome studies have been carried out and the associations between religious beliefs or experiences and various types of physical illnesses , mental health , and mortality have been examined .\nspirituality is viewed as personally important matter to the older people and it has been proved that it is highly related to older people 's health outcomes .  \nhowever , there has not been adequate experiential research on the relationship between religious or spiritual factors and healthy lifestyle behaviors , and their impact on the adult 's well - being .\nscientists believe that probing the effects of religious and spiritual factors as well as healthy lifestyle behaviors may be decisive .\nadditionally , social science and medical research have concurrently reported that older adults are more inclined to take spiritual chase than younger people are .  \nkotrotsiou - barboutal et al.(2006 ) indicated that older adults are remaining members of religious associations without necessarily participating regularly in services , as there are numerous issues that can diminish the active participation in religious events , such as transportation intricacies , bad sound , or the illegibility of small font text in books of prayers available at mosques or religious centers . in spite of those complexities ,\nmany elderly manage to find out a way to come up to god through prayer .\nit is stated that prayer increases the feelings of personal value of an elderly by reducing the feelings of loneliness and desertation , while television and radio provide support for spiritual life .   in this regard , researchers have shown that some groups of elderly people with inadequate and difficult livelihood situations communicate their problems by putting their trust in god . moreover , more than half of the elder patients practiced spiritual needs throughout their hospitalization period , with the most prominent need of being in the search of the meaning of life .  \nextensive epidemiological studies have shown that higher levels of religiousness are related to lower mortality rates .\nstudies identified the multidimensional nature of religiousness and spirituality and investigated various religious dimensions , for instance private religious behaviors , devotion , spiritual transcendence , and religious adaptation .\nfor example , it was indicated that some aspects of religiousness predicted lower rates of disability and illness , alcoholism , cardiovascular disease , hypertension , and myocardial infarction .\nfurthermore , clinical research has suggested that spirituality can play a vital role in the recovery of patients suffering from physical and psychological diseases .  \nit seems that religious obligation has a crucial role in averting physical and mental diseases , recovery promotion , and disease adaptation .\nnumerous studies have revealed the positive involvement of spirituality and religious indexes on different aspects of health such as cardiac surgery , mortality , immunity system function and self esteem .  \nabove all , religious involvement can be useful for psychological well - being and physical health .\nadditionally , supporting the effect of spirituality may become more and more prominent in later life as a result of declining health , social and financial sources .\nresearchers have proposed numerous psychological , social , and physiological interveners that may explain the spirituality - health association .  \nquantitative measurements and the evaluation of spiritual beliefs are difficult because quantitative studies neither reveal the content , components of the beliefs , and its factors , nor the contexts that might be included . therefore , implementing qualitative research that explores the personal and experiential aspects of beliefs seems crucial , and may shed light on a range of important issues which can be investigated in detail on larger samples by further quantitative studies in future .  \nspiritual or religious beliefs may affect the decisions of individuals that make about their health and illness .\nthus , recognizing and understanding the spiritual and religious behaviors within the context of cultural influence by a qualitative research is critical for nurse and other health - care providers .\nthe main strengths of the present study are that it focuses on the spiritual life of healthy elderly people .\ntherefore , the present study aimed to explore the concept of spirituality from the perspectives of iranian healthy elderly people . the central question of the paper was  what characterizes the spirituality in the iranian healthy older people ?\nin this research , a qualitative approach was adopted using conventional content analysis of unstructured interviews carried out with 17 healthy elderly people in tehran in 2010 - 2011 .\nit is worth noting that spirituality is underpinned by personal and cultural context in any community ; therefore , qualitative research is the best method to study cultural context - bound subjects .  \ninitially purposeful sampling was used and continued with purposeful sampling according to the codes and categories emerged from data .\nthe study consisted of 17 healthy elders within the age range of 65 - 86 .\ncriteria for selection were having age above 65 , living with family , not having any cognitive problems , not having any physical limitation in adl , and willingness to participate in the study .\nall participants were shia muslims . in order to achieve the wide range of experiences and perceptions of elderly participants , some field notes writing and 21 interviews were conducted according to emerged codes and categories from data . the first researcher communicated with each of the participants to describe the purpose of research and research questions .\nbased on the participants preference , the interviews were performed in a private room at the house of elderly , park , worksite , or mosque , using an individual semi -

2011 .\nit is worth noting that spirituality is underpinned by personal and cultural context in any community ; therefore , qualitative research is the best method to study cultural context - bound subjects .\ninitially purposeful sampling was used and continued with purposeful sampling according to the codes and categories emerged from data .\nthe study consisted of 17 healthy elders within the age range of 65 - 86 .\ncriteria for selection were having age above 65 , living with family , not having any cognitive problems , not having any physical limitation in adl , and willingness to participate in the study .\nin order to achieve the wide range of experiences and perceptions of elderly participants , some field notes writing and 21 interviews were conducted according to emerged codes and categories from data . the first researcher communicated with each of the participants to describe the purpose of research and research questions . the interview was scheduled according to the participant 's agreement .\nbased on the participants preference , the interviews were performed in a private room at the house of elderly , park , worksite , or mosque , using an individual semi -

4 distinctive subcategories within each category were identified .\nthese categories and their subcategories represent the main factors influencing the spirituality in iranian elderly people .\nmain categories and subcategories one of the main categories that emerged from data analysis was  spiritual health  . four subcategories ;\n saying prayer as a calming factor  ,  beneficence as a way to god  ,  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , and  faith , a way to happiness  , emerged from the participants experiences .\nalso many of the participants considered the prayer time as an opportunity for purification which made them more tolerant to the adversities and has a calming effect on them .\n i want to say that waking up early in the morning , having the spirit for things like prayer , citing quran verses , thanking god for his blessings and doing exercise would make you quiet and happy until the end of the day  .\n( male ) most participants believed that dealing with the affairs of the elderly and giving them a helping hand in their lives have positive consequences for the servers .\nthey also believed that doing good things to older adults will lead them to pray for the servers which in turn cause good things in the servers lives .\nthey said that man would receive god 's blessings as a consequence of his / her deeds in the world .\nadditionally , they believed that the ultimate consequence of good deeds was good in return .\nif she asks me to fix her air conditioner you can be sure that i ll do it .\nthis is because i think that by doing this i make her happy and she prays for me .\n, the participants said that in iran the elderly people feel psychologically and spiritually alone and they do not receive any institutionally based mental and spiritual support .\n when i think about my life , i feel that i do n't have any support from my children .\nalso in the street and road we do n't have appropriate social respect and i want to say that in our society there is limited support and backing for people like me . \n( female ) the elderly participants lived experiences disclosed the subcategory of  faith , a way to happiness  in life .\none of participants described that having strong faith was very important over the elderly life and adopting a healthy life style depended mostly on their faith and beliefs .\nalso , they stressed that faith will lead them to a sense of physical and mental welfare and happiness . \nthe one who has strong faith and beliefs is always happy and confident . in my opinion\nworshiping god , praying , fasting , reciting quran , purity and attending mosques are important elements in life , and bring happiness to your life and set your soul free  .\n( male )  spiritual beliefs  was a main category that emerged from the participants lived experiences of spiritual concept and this category was further subcategorized into three subcategories including  seeking help from god in difficulties \n doing good deeds is the god 's will  . regarding the subcategory of  seeking help from god in difficulties \n, the participants believed that wishing for and seeking help from god can help the elderly people to deal better with life difficulties , disperses and stresses .\nthis desire results in god 's attention to elderly and also creates sense of trust in older adults .\nsome statements said by participants are :  i really believe in having trust in god . when i m trapped in a complicated situation\n, i believe that this is god who helps me and i only trust in god .  ( male ) one participant believed that spirituality was a vital component of older people lives .\nalso , he believed that god was the ultimate source to affect my life or death and he controls everything .\n we re all waiting to see when the angel of death arrives and takes us away .\n( male ) concerning the subcategory of  doing good deeds is the god 's will  , the participants believed that trust in god guided them to many positive activities in their lives .\nthey believed that calling the name of god while getting out of house , remembering him throughout the daytime and praying will lead them to prosperity .\none participant said that trust in god , submitting to god 's will and thinking about god all the time helped him to work and deal with anybody without any behavioral problems .\n when i want to get out of my house for work , e first thing that comes to mind is that \n my dear god : bestow upon me everything which is good for me and while i m out working , i do my best not to misbehave or do anything bad to anybody .  ( male ) another most important category that emerged was religious practice with three distinctive subcategories including : saying prayers , reciting quran , and going to mosque , religious ceremonies and pilgrimage .\nthe majority of the participants indicated that they had good knowledge of quran , said prayers regularly , and went to mosque for religious and social activities .\nfor example one participant said that participating in religious settings and ceremonies led her to find new friends and got her out of loneliness .\nwe go to quran classes on friday mornings also.(male )  i have so much interest for pilgrimage and saying daily payers at the earliest recommended time when call for prayer is announced .\ni go to the religious rites with the my friends and peers , and i want to get out of loneliness .\n( female ) thus , it can be concluded that all of the participants rose early to start their religious acts of devotion , prayers , and worship in their home or mosque .\none of the main categories that emerged from data analysis was  spiritual health  .\nfour subcategories ;  saying prayer as a calming factor  ,  beneficence as a way to god  ,  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , and  faith , a way to happiness  , emerged from the participants experiences .\nalso many of the participants considered the prayer time as an opportunity for purification which made them more tolerant to the adversities and has a calming effect on them .\n i want to say that waking up early in the morning , having the spirit for things like prayer , citing quran verses , thanking god for his blessings and doing exercise would make you quiet and happy until the end of the day  .\n( male ) most participants believed that dealing with the affairs of the elderly and giving them a helping hand in their lives have positive consequences for the servers .\nthey also believed that doing good things to older adults will lead them to pray for the servers which in turn cause good things in the servers lives .\nthey said that man would receive god 's blessings as a consequence of his / her deeds in the world .\nadditionally , they believed that the ultimate consequence of good deeds was good in return .\nif she asks me to fix her air conditioner you can be sure that i ll do it .\nthis is because i think that by doing this i make her happy and she prays for me .\n( female ) moreover regarding  loss of psychological and spiritual support  , the participants said that in iran the elderly people feel psychologically and spiritually alone and they do not receive any institutionally based mental and spiritual support .\n when i think about my life , i feel that i do n't have any support from my children .\nalso in the street and road we do n't have appropriate social respect and i want to say that in our society there is limited support and backing for people like me . \n( female ) the elderly participants lived experiences disclosed the subcategory of  faith , a way to happiness  in life .\none of participants described that having strong faith was very important over the elderly life and adopting a healthy life style depended mostly on their faith and beliefs .\nalso , they stressed that faith will lead them to a sense of physical and mental welfare and happiness . \nthe one who has strong faith and beliefs is always happy and confident . in my opinion\nworshiping god , praying , fasting , reciting quran , purity and attending mosques are important elements in life , and bring happiness to your life and set your soul free  .\n spiritual beliefs  was a main category that emerged from the participants lived experiences of spiritual concept and this category was further subcategorized into three subcategories including  seeking help from god in difficulties  ,  only god 's power over life and death  , and \ndoing good deeds is the god 's will  . regarding the subcategory of  seeking help from god in difficulties  , the participants believed\nthat wishing for and seeking help from god can help the elderly people to deal better with life difficulties , disperses and stresses .\nthis desire results in god 's attention to elderly and also creates sense of trust in older adults .\nsome statements said by participants are :  i really believe in having trust in god . when i m trapped in a complicated situation\n, i believe that this is god who helps me and i only trust in god .

( male )\nanother most important category that emerged was religious practice with three distinctive subcategories including : saying prayers , reciting quran , and going to mosque , religious ceremonies and pilgrimage .\nthe majority of the participants indicated that they had good knowledge of quran , said prayers regularly , and went to mosque for religious and social activities .\nfor example one participant said that participating in religious settings and ceremonies led her to find new friends and got her out of loneliness .\nwe go to quran classes on friday mornings also.(male )  i have so much interest for pilgrimage and saying daily payers at the earliest recommended time when call for prayer is announced .\ni go to the religious rites with the my friends and peers , and i want to get out of loneliness .\n( female ) thus , it can be concluded that all of the participants rose early to start their religious acts of devotion , prayers , and worship in their home or mosque .\nthis qualitative study describes the concept of spirituality and its impression on iranian elderly people daily living behaviors .\nthe findings are significant as they reveal that the living experiences of saying prayer as a calming factor , beneficence as a way to god , loss of psychological and spiritual support , and faith , a way to happiness , are the most important domain and subcategory of spiritual health of elderly people , which can positively affect their health . on the other hand spiritual health\nis an important dimension of human health and it can determine the individual integrity . also spiritual health is a power that coordinates physical , mental and social dimensions and is necessary in coping with diseases . when spiritual health will is at serious risk , individuals may be stricken by mental disorders such as loneliness , depression , and loss of meaning .\nthere are a number of studies that support the beneficial effects of spirituality on health .\nbehaviors such as reliance on god , pilgrimage and praying create hope and positive attitudes that lead to internal serenity , peacefulness and meaningful life .\nmost faithful people describe their relationship with god as a relationship with an intimate friend and believe that they can control the effect of irrepressible situations by having recourse to god .\nall in all , religious adaptation relies on beliefs and religious activities and help people to control their stress and physical disorders . having meaning and goal in life , sense of belonging to a sublime source , hope for gods support in time of trouble and social and spiritual support are among the sources that help religious people to suffer less from hardships of life . in the iranian society context , where the majority of the population are muslim , and\na religious culture is dominant in the society , it is expected that tendency to spirituality could be affect their health .\npraying is the expression of soul and a deep human instinct that arises from human soul and is uttered with profound words .\nit is neither dependent upon any particular spirituality nor entailed in any time and place .\nthe content of praying includes confession of sins and weakness , pleading for forgiveness , bliss and closeness to god .\npraying reduces mental and psychological pains , releases personal emotions , leading individual to attain eternal source of power .\nweeping that often comes with praying greatly helps a person to release his or her distress and emotions .\nalso prayer helped participants to cope with disease and gave them calm , hope and inner strength .\nin this regard , quran has put it magnificently :  those who have faith in god and inundate their hearts with name of god , surely god remembrance ascertains their hearts  ( ( quran , chapter 13 : sureh 13 , al - rad ) verse 28 ) .\nmany americans , regardless of their health status , rely on their religious and spiritual beliefs to cope with stressful life events .\nthe present study has demonstrated that one of the most important factors that help elderly in confronting with difficulties was seeking help from god .\nseveral studies noted that spirituals beliefs had positive influence on welfare and personal and social life of elderly people .\neffective spiritual coping strategies help individuals find meaning and purpose in their life , problems and difficulties . for instance\n, one study showed that healthy older adults believed that a higher power supports them and that having a relationship with god forms a foundation for their psychological well - being .\nthus , spirituality plays an important role in the lives of healthy individuals , too .\nbelieving in support from spiritual / religious resource and connectedness with a higher power is beneficial and it can affect issues of control , quality of life , spiritual well - being , coping , depression , decision - making , and possibly health outcomes .\nfor instance , it has been reported that healthy older adults believe that a higher power supports them and that having a relationship with god forms a foundation for their psychological well - being .\nthus , spirituality plays an important role in the lives of healthy individuals . in the result of our study\na sense of god 's power over life and death and doing good deeds is the god 's will were derived from participants experience around spiritual beliefs .\nall the participants talked about the importance of god and belief to god 's power in their life .\nmoreover , the findings reveal that god 's power was very important in personal and private experiences . in this regard , roff et al.(2009 ) in a qualitative study through a thematic content analysis identified god 's power in the lived experiences of women who were suffering from breast cancer . also , in another qualitative study by taleghani et al .\n( 2006 ) belief to god 's will was a important key in acceptance of disease .\n2002 ) suggested that personal variables such as the concept of god and perception of others beliefs played important mediating roles in religious coping with stress situations .\nreligious practices were a subcategory that emerged from the lived experiences of elderly participants in this research . furthermore , the results of study by keefe et al .\n( 2001 ) showed that individuals who reported frequent daily spiritual experiences had higher levels of positive mood , lower levels of daily negative mood , and higher levels of all of the social support domains .\nanother subcategory that emerged from participants experience was going to mosque and religious ceremonies . in this regard , palinkas ( 1982 ) found that religious ceremonies are supportive for individuals because liberating and curative friendships relevant to spiritual states brings about psychological health for them . attending religious ceremonies and shrines also reduces individuals anxieties and sense of loneliness .\nthese results are in accordance with our study findings which show that elderly women who participate in religious ceremonies , are relieved from loneliness . also koenig ( 1998 )\nsuggested that religious practices , attitudes and coping behaviors are prevalent among hospitalized medically ill older adults and are related to social , psychological and physical health outcomes .\nmorris ( 1983 ) examined the relationship between anxiety and pilgrimage and found that people with religious devotion experienced significantly lower rates of anxiety disorder compared to the non - religious group .\nevery muslim learns their prayers from a young age and prays five times a day .\nin addition , those who seek guidance from the holy quran and believe that it has power over every aspect of their lives , expect and welcome any eventualities in their lives ( quran , chapter balad , verse 4 ) .\nit seems that elderly people have more tendencies to religious and spiritual subjects than young people .\nkoenig et al . ( 2004 ) in his study showed spirituality and religion as an important factor in their lives more often than younger ones .\nseveral experimental studies have been conducted that showed positive effects of prayer on the management of physical symptoms of illness .\nkwilecki ( 1986 ) assessed the effect of prayer on stress and anxiety and found that 42% of participants report that saying prayer can diminish the stress and anxiety . also salehi ( 2001 ) found that individuals who pray regularly , experienced significantly lower rates of anxiety disorder and depression , psychological balance and hopefulness , compared to the non - prayer group .\nazizi ( 1996 ) found that more than 90% of prayers attained psychological tranquility and relaxation after saying prayer .\nseveral studies noted moderately positive correlations between indicators of physical health and prayer activities . also several studies have shown that prayer can play an important role in the recovery of patients who suffer from cardiac disease , hiv , arthritis rheumatoid , and cva attack , cancer cases , treatment of addiction , and physical , mental and social well - being .\nfurthermore , evidence suggests that patients with strong religious beliefs and high levels of religious activity experience lower levels of pain , have better immune function , lower death rates from cancer , fewer incidences of heart disease , lower blood pressure and levels of cholesterol , better health behaviors , and greater compliance with medical treatment .\nthe practical relevance of this study may conduct future work to further explicate and clarify the linkages between spirituality and physical and mental health and life style .\nfuture empirical research and new methods of investigation such as concept analysis , grounded theory , and action research are needed to develop the new models of caring for management of this group . in the life style area ,\nfuture research should focus on the effects of spirituality on elderly people lifestyle domains and on the development of valid and reliable instruments to measure these effects .\nit is important to conduct such research in different samples , such as unhealthy elderly people ( frail , ill , and sick elderly people ) .\nfuture empirical research and new methods of investigation such as concept analysis , grounded theory , and action research are needed to develop the new models of caring for management of this group . in the life style area ,\nfuture research should focus on the effects of spirituality on elderly people lifestyle domains and on the development of valid and reliable instruments to measure these effects .\nit is important to conduct such research in different samples , such as unhealthy elderly people ( frail , ill , and sick elderly people ) .\nin summary , we found that elderly people describe several elements in their illustration of spirituality in healthcare settings .\nspiritual health , spiritual beliefs , and religious practice intentionality were the main components of concept of spirituality in this group experiences .\nalso , the findings of this study made it clear that spirituality has a considerable effect on the health and life of iranian elderly people and is a major supportive resource for their physical and psychosocial health .\nit can reduce mental distress and induce inner peace and hopefulness . because of the significant influence of spirituality on all domains of health of elderly people , it is critically important that health care providers understand how spirituality can considerably influence elderly people throughout their life .\nthese findings will assist health professionals such as nurses , physicians , and social workers to recognize the spiritual needs and value the role of spirituality in promoting health and well - being among elderly people from different religions and cultures worldwide ."}
{"id": 52, "text": "according to the national regulations regarding diagnostic criteria of brain death ( bd ) , instrumental confirmatory tests should be used in certain clinical situations , such as intoxications , infratentorial processes , extensive facial damage , children younger than 2  years of age , or any case in which clinical examinations are inadequate .\nelectrophysiological tests are often unavailable due to limited access to proper equipment and competent specialists . therefore ,\ntwo of them , catheter angiography and computed tomographic angiography ( cta ) , are based on the detection of contrast enhancement of cerebral vessels . in these examinations ,\nfirst is a non - filling phenomenon , which means a complete absence of contrast above the carotid siphons and foramen magnum .\nsecond is a delayed , weak , and persistent opacification of proximal segments of the cerebral arteries not reaching cortical branches .\nstasis filling causes a significant problem in interpretation of cta results in the diagnosis of bd . since 1998 ,\nwhen cta was proposed as the new imaging technique in the diagnostics of bd , a consensus on its interpretation criteria has not been reached .\nan analysis of stasis filling in a dynamic series of computed tomographic perfusion ( ctp ) can provide valuable information on the interpretation of cta results and relation of this phenomenon to brain perfusion .\nthe aim of this prospective study was to characterize stasis filling phenomenon in the diagnosis of bd . to achieve this\n, we performed a dynamic evaluation of contrast enhancement of the cerebral and extracranial arteries in patients with bd and control subjects with the use of the 40-s series of ctp scans .\nwe also confronted stasis filling pattern with ctp findings to assess the relevance of this phenomenon to brain perfusion .\nwe examined 67 patients who fulfilled clinical bd criteria according to the national regulations ( coma , apnea , and no brainstem reflexes ) . the examination protocol consisted of cta , followed by ctp and catheter angiography .\nthirty - seven subjects were excluded due to lack of contrast enhancement in the intracranial arteries in ctp series .\nfinally , 30 ( 44.8  % ) patients , in whom analysis of ctp series enabled us to identify contrast - enhanced intracranial arteries , were enrolled in the study .\nthe population consisted of 18 men and 12 women with a median age of 54.5  years ( range , 2284  years ) .\ninitial causes of coma were intracerebral hemorrhage ( n  =  16 ) , subarachnoid

) .\nthis artery was visible in all control examinations ( contralateral artery to the clipped aneurysm was always chosen ) and 23 examinations of bd patients . among the remaining seven examinations in six cases , the only opacified cerebral artery was aca and in one case pca ( see table  1 ) .\nrois were automatically propagated over the entire series of scans . for each roi , time\ncalculation

for measurements of cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) and cerebral blood volume ( cbv ) with the multimodality workplace and syngo ve40a software package ( siemens ag , erlangen , germany ) .\nthis software is based on a maximum slope method , which assumes that there is no venous outflow from the tissue volume under consideration during the time of observation .\ntherefore , the lack of venous outflow in bd patients was not an obstacle , and calculation of cbf and cbv was feasible in all cases .\nwe chose the same cerebral arteries , which were used in the first part of post - processing for calculation of tdcs .\ncbf and cbv values were measured in circular 2.53.5-cm rois placed in the cortical regions of the frontal , temporal , occipital lobes , and basal nuclei of both hemispheres with exclusion of major blood vessels .\nangiography was performed with a delay of 15  min to 3  h after ctp .\nwe used two angiographic systems : fluorospot top and axiom artis ( siemens ag , germany

germany ) .\nthis software is based on a maximum slope method , which assumes that there is no venous outflow from the tissue volume under consideration during the time of observation .\ntherefore , the lack of venous outflow in bd patients was not an obstacle , and calculation of cbf and cbv was feasible in all cases .\nwe chose the same cerebral arteries , which were used in the first part of

of bd patients with and without craniectomy . in the subgroup with craniectomy , time to peak and delay of cerebral peak were shorter in comparison to the subgroup without craniectomy ( see table  4 ) .\na statistically insignificant trend was found in the analysis of tdcs in bd patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sah ) and intracerebral hemorrhage ( ich ) .\nwe revealed a tendency to longer

46.7  % ) and non - filling in 16 ( 53.3  % ) cases . in 37\nexcluded bd patients , angiography revealed a non - filling pattern in all cases ; no stasis filling was noted .\nthe term stasis filling for describing a delayed , weak , and persistent intracranial opacification in patients with bd was used for the first time by kricheff et al . in 1978 .\nmunari et al . reported stasis filling in 5  % ( one out of 20 ) , braun et al . in 11  % ( 15/140 ) , bradac et al . in 12.5  % ( two out of 16 ) , kricheff et al . in 15  % ( three out of 20 ) , and savard et al . in 28  % ( nine out of 32 ) of cases [ 2 , 69 ] .\nnoted stasis filling in 43  % ( six out of 14 ) and welschehold et al . in 59  % ( 37/63 ) of cases [ 3 , 10 ] .\nstasis filling , as specific angiographic pattern of cerebral circulatory arrest , is a consequence of two major factors : raised intracranial pressure ( icp ) and high cerebrovascular resistance ( cvr ) .\nthey both cause reduction of cbf , according to poiseuille s law : cbf  =  cpp / cvr  =  ( mabp    icp)/cvr , where cpp stands for cerebral perfusion pressure . increased cvr in extreme cerebral hemodynamic disturbances\nwas revealed in studies using a transcranial doppler ( tcd ) [ 11 , 12 ] .\nthis is caused mainly by altered cerebral autoregulation mechanisms , which are sufficient to preserve almost constant cbf when cpp is above 50  mmhg .\ncessation of capillary circulation is consistent with cerebral circulatory arrest while proximal arterial segments are still patent . at this stage\n, tcd frequently shows  to and fro  or narrow systolic spike patterns , which reflect blood movement [ 11 , 12 ] . in such circumstances ,\nheartbeat driven slow propagation of contrast column in proximal cerebral arteries is possible . in the present study ,\nrecently revealed a potential efficacy of ctp for assessing brain death . in this material ,\nctp detected complete absence of brain perfusion reflected by zero values of cbf and cbv in all cases .\nthese findings clearly show that stasis filling is not an indicator of any residual brain perfusion but only ineffective propagation of contrast in cerebral vessels ; thus , it does not preclude diagnosis of brain death .\nctp results are complementary to the recent report of selcuk et al . , which revealed global reduction of adc consistent with necrosis of neurons using diffusion - weighted mri technique .\nthe findings showed two features of stasis filling phenomenon : delay and weakness of intracranial opacification .\ntdcs for cerebral arteries in bd patients were characterized by significantly longer times to peak ( median , 32  s ) compared to controls ( 21  s ) . moreover\n, intracranial peak enhancement occurred with a median delay of 14.5  s to extracranial peak .\nthis is consistent with observations in cta studies , in which intracranial filling in bd patients is usually detected in the late phase ( performed 60  s after contrast injection ) and very rarely in the early phase of scanning [ 3 , 10 , 17 ] .\ncorrelation with ctp results shows that such delayed vascular opacification does not provide any brain perfusion , thus can not preclude diagnosis of brain death .\ntypical cerebral tdc in bd patients was a flat curve with a low peak ( median value of 34.5  hu ) ; about three times lower compared to the peak in the extracranial artery .\nin contrast , extra- and intracranial tdcs in the control group represented steep and narrow gaussian curves , and both peaks were of similar height .\nsuch low peak values could be the reason of lower detectability of stasis filling by catheter angiography compared to ct ( 14/67  =  21  % vs. 30/67  =  45  % cases ) observed in the present study .\nthese findings are consistent with results of others as was presented in the first paragraph of discussion .\nalso observed underestimation of intracranial filling in catheter angiography compared to cta in four out of seven cases .\nalthough , a larger amount of contrast was used in dynamic ct than in catheter angiography ( 50 vs. 30  ml ) , but in angiography , it was injected intra - arterially , which minimizes the effect of dilution .\nthis discrepancy could be a result of advanced reconstruction algorithms , systems of noise reduction , and signal amplification used in ct scanners , which reduce noise , improve spatial resolution , and low contrast detectability\n. the other explanation could be the time sequence in performing ctp and catheter angiography .\nangiography was carried out with a delay from 15  min to 3  h after ctp . during this period\n, slow rising icp could stop the propagation of contrast at the level of skull base . analyzing the influence of demographic and clinical features on tdc s parameters\n, we found a statistically significant trend towards shorter time to peak and shorter delay of peak in the cerebral arteries of bd patients with craniectomy compared to those without it .\nmoreover , the incidence of craniectomy was much lower in bd patients excluded from the study due to lack of intracranial opacification ( four out of 37  =  11  % ) compared to included patients who presented intracranial filling ( 19/30  =  63  % ) .\nseveral authors previously reported a relationship between skull defect and preserved intracranial filling in bd patients [ 7 , 18 , 19 ] .\nthis can be explained by a decreased icp enabling propagation of contrast in the cerebral vessels .\na statistically insignificant trend was found in the analysis of tdcs in bd patients with sah and intracerebral hemorrhage .\nwe revealed a tendency to longer time to peak and longer delay of cerebral peak in the group with sah compared to the group with ich .\nthis difference was probably caused by vasospasm after sah , which independently increases cvr and additionally contributes to slowing down the propagation of contrast .\nthe major drawback of this study is a consequence of performing ctp shortly after cta in bd patients .\nthe influence of residual contrast injected for cta was reflected by higher baseline density in the cerebral and extracranial arteries , higher and earlier peak enhancement , and shorter time to peak in the extracranial vessels in bd patients compared to controls .\nhowever , this contrast contamination should not significantly change values of delay of cerebral peak or c / e peak ratio as they were calculated on the basis of both cerebral and extracranial tcds .\nin this study , we assessed the characteristic features of intracranial filling in bd patients  delay and weakness of cerebrovascular opacification .\nit led to the conclusion that delayed and weak opacification of cerebral arteries do not necessarily mean the presence of cerebral perfusion , thus does not preclude diagnosis of bd ."}

operative diagnostics were not extended beyond the tests received from the district hospital .\nthe patient underwent surgery on 10.05.2010 and intraoperatively , besides the expected neoplastic tumour of the left ovary with infiltration of the ureter , numerous neoplastic foci were also found : a sigmoid colon tumour , a caecum tumour , a tumour of the body of the stomach and two single tumours in the omentum .\nbecause of the resectability of the neoplastic foci described above , the operation plan adopted earlier was changed and the following were performed in succession with palliative intention : partial gastrectomy by the rydygier method , right - sided hemicolectomy , left ovariectomy and sigmoid resection . after restoring the continuity of the alimentary tract ,\nthe tumour occluded the lumen , which is why segmental ureterectomy was performed with end - to - end anastomosis over a pigtail catheter .\nthe patient passed the post - operative period without complications , except a two - day fever .\nbecause of the expected alimentary tract failure , parenteral nutrition was included on the 1st day after the procedure and blood deficits were supplemented with 2 units of erythrocyte mass and 7 units of plasma .\non the 9th day after the operation , the patient was discharged home in a good general condition with recommendations for further treatment .\nthe received postoperative histopathological protocol indicated that the stomach was the origin of the neoplastic process .\nto lauren ) , type i ( acc . to goseki ) , of a stomach adenocarcinoma with a g2 malignancy degree , with occupation of the whole thickness of the stomach wall , with the following immunohistochemical characteristics : ck7(+++ ) , ck20(++ ) , ca125(+ ) , mucicarmine(+ ) .\nneoplastic infiltrations along nerves and neoplastic embolisms of blood vessels , as well as metastatic foci in the greater omentum , were observed in the specimen . because of the palliative partial gastrectomy type , only 3 lymph nodes were described in this specimen and all of them contained neoplastic cells . besides the above\n, histopathological confirmations were obtained of the metastatic character of the foci in the ovary , caecum and sigmoid colon .\nthe cancer occupied large and small intestine walls without infiltration of the mucous membrane and the immunohistochemical characteristics were identical as for the primary lesion . according to the above protocol , excision within tissues with a healthy margin of these organs was achieved .\nthe widening of the left ureter is visible ( marked by arrow ) focus of metastatic carcinoma in the ureter wall\n. microscopic section , he staining , magnification 40 neoplastic invasion in the ureter wall .\nmicroscopic section , he staining , magnification 100 it is interesting biologically and constitutes the basis for this paper that the ureteral tumour was described by the pathologists not as a neoplastic infiltration encroaching on the ureter , but as a metastatic focus to the ureteral wall .\nafter the operative treatment , the patient was qualified for palliative chemotherapy and received it from 28.07.2010 .\nthe first treatment course was according to the eox regimen ( oxaliplatin and capecitabine ) , but because of the occurrence of neutropenic fever the regimen was changed to pf ( cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil ) .\nshe again received only one course and the treatment was changed once more because newly formed metastatic foci in the liver were located in imaging tests .\nnext , three chemotherapy courses were administered according to the folfiri regimen ( irinotecan , leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil ) , but only until 11.11.2010 because due to progression of changes in the liver described in examinations the chemotherapy was discontinued and the patient was qualified for symptomatic treatment . according to our knowledge\ntreatment of gastric cancer in the disseminated phase of the disease aims at extension of life and achieving a good palliative effect .\nthe recommended methods , allowing the above to be achieved , are chemotherapy or combination radiochemotherapy . in an advanced stage ,\npalliative operations on this organ are performed for life reasons and serve to eliminate complications such as bleeding , perforation or obstruction of the organ .\nit is indicated that the above complications forced surgical intervention in 1/4 of the patients previously disqualified from operative treatment because of the presence of metastatic foci . according to literature data , patients operated on by palliative resection in the disseminated phase of the disease achieve a survival time of between 9 and 15 months . the survival time is limited by the number of metastatic foci ; when their number is higher than two foci , no statistically significant differences are observed in this scope\n. the value of these procedures is increasing because of the reported low perioperative mortality and the observed significant improvement in the further quality of life for these patients [ 513 ] .\nit seems that the operative procedure conducted in the presented patient allowed a good palliative effect to be achieved along with loss of severe colic and maintenance of kidney function .\nthe literature often presents , as characteristic of gastric cancer , blood - borne metastasis to the ovary , termed a krukenberg tumour .\nthis is a term generally defining metastasis to the ovary , mainly gastric cancer and next colon cancer .\nmetastases from other organs , such as the lungs , the mammary gland and the uterus , are also possible , though much rarer .\nkrukenberg tumours are encountered in the course of 2 - 4% of disseminated neoplastic processes .\nthis is a negative prognostic factor , with varying median survival time after its diagnosis : 12 - 13 months in the course of gastric cancer compared to 17 - 29 months in the course of large intestine cancer .\nthis undoubtedly results from biological differences in the course of these neoplasms [ 1423 ] . in summary ,\nthe available literature sources have described this only twice to date ( in 1976 and 2000 ) .\nhowever , nephroureterectomy was conducted in these quoted cases [ 24 , 25 ] . in the presented patient\nthe kidney was spared and healing of the ureter after end -

however , their therapeutic effects are not clear and would require more studies .\nalthough rare , eosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral blood eosinophilia .\nlymphoma of the stomach , gastric cancer , and crohn disease involving the stomach may demonstrate endoscopic features similar to those of eosinophilic gastritis .\ngastrointestinal parasitic infection should be considered in patients with abdominal discomfort , weight loss , and peripheral eosinophilia . in particular , infestations by hookworms ,\nascaris , strongyloides , toxocara , trichuris , and intestinal capillaria should be considered in patients from endemic areas . in this case , the concentration of the antigen - specific ige to the a. simplex was 0.57\nmoreover , the serology for toxocara antibodies ( igg ) was positive . however , this is not clinically significant in korea because koreans often consume raw fish , which causes repeated exposures to anisakis .\nin addition , she had not had contact with any animals , including dogs and cats , at least for several years .\nmoreover , she was treated with albendazole for 5 days , and her symptoms had become worse . after steroid treatment , the symptoms disappeared and the eosinophil count decreased to the reference range .\nmoreover , the follow - up egd showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue\n. she had undergone several egds that showed diffuse necrotic change in the fundus , cardia , and upper body .\nthe etiology includes thromboembolism and occlusion of major arterial supply , ingestion of corrosive agents , volvulus of the stomach , endoscopic hemostatic injections , and infectious gastritis . in this case\nthus , the possible cause of gangrene could be infection , and she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics ( cefoperazone and metronidazole ) .\nhowever , she was treated with broad - spectrum antibiotics during the next 5 days , and her symptoms became worse .\nthe necrotic portion of the gastric high body is very vulnerable site of retching injury .\nthis retching injury is called prolapse gastropathy syndrome , a clinical syndrome involving the invagination of part of the gastric mucosa into the lower esophagus .\ndirect trauma to the mucosa occurs when the gastric mucosa becomes incarcerated through the lower esophageal sphincter .\nin addition , the endoscopic findings and histopathologic results were not compatible to prolapse gastropathy syndrome . on the basis of the clinical picture , laboratory findings , and therapeutic results , we concluded the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis in our patient .\nthis case highlights the reality of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis , and that endoscopy and histopathological examination of the biopsies are the most useful tools for the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis .\neosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with necrotic gastritis who do not respond to empirical treatment ."}
{"id": 55, "text": "the skin is the largest organ of the body and protects the organism against external physical , chemical , and biological insults such as wounding , uvb radiation , and microorganisms .\nthis major barrier resides in the upper layers of the epidermis ( for review see segre , 2006 ) . the epidermis is the upper part of the skin that is continuously renewed .\nthe basal layer , or stratum basale , of the epidermis contains proliferating keratinocytes ( fig .\n1 ) . upon withdrawal from the cell cycle , these basal keratinocytes detach from the basement membrane and undergo a terminal differentiation program to become corneocytes in the outer layers of the epidermis .\nthe cells reinforce their cytoskeletal keratin filament network , and adjacent cells interact via many desmosomes , a specialized type of cell junction , to resist physical trauma . in the stratum granulosum ,\nthe keratinocytes become more flattened and express certain proteins such as profilaggrin and loricrin , which aggregate to form the typical keratohyalin granules of the stratum granulosum . in addition , lipids are produced and stored in lamellar bodies . at the final stage of differentiation , the keratinocytes lose their organelles , including the nucleus , and become the dead , flattened corneocytes of the stratum corneum . during cornification , proteins are cross - linked at the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane to form a cornified envelope ( for review see candi et al . , 2005 ) . in the transitional layer between the stratum granulosum and the stratum corneum , lipids are extruded to form a water - repelling envelope around the cornified envelope , thereby assuring an adequate permeability barrier function of the mammalian epidermis .\nimproper formation of these envelopes results in an impaired epidermal barrier that can not protect against dehydration , uvb , and infection .\nthe signaling cascades involved in epidermal barrier formation are largely unknown , but the many proteases that seem to be involved are currently being intensively studied .\nsee introduction for details . since the cloning of caspase-14 in the late nineties , it has become clear that this protease is a unique member of the caspase family .\nunlike apoptotic caspases , which evolved in common ancestors such as hydra , echinodermata , insects , nematodes , and chordates , caspase-14 has so far been found only in terrestrial mammals ( lamkanfi et al . , 2002 ) .\nin contrast to the ubiquitously expressed other members of the caspase family , caspase-14 is expressed and activated mainly in the epidermis and is absent from most other adult tissues ( eckhart et al .\nrecently , caspase-14 was found to be involved in epidermal barrier formation ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nin this review , we discuss current knowledge of the expression , regulation , and function of caspase-14 .\nthe expression pattern of caspase-14 is unique among the caspases , as it is present mainly in cornifying epithelia , such as the epidermis , the hassall 's bodies of the thymus , and the forestomach of rodents ( lippens et al . , 2000 , 2005 ;\nin skin , caspase-14 is expressed only in the differentiating and cornifying layers of the epidermis and the hair follicle ( lippens et al . , 2000 ;\nthis is consistent with the observation that , in vitro , caspase-14 is only expressed in differentiating but not in proliferating keratinocytes ( lippens et al .\nremarkably , nail matrix keratinocytes that differentiate into specialized nail corneocytes , the building blocks of the nail plate , do not express caspase-14 ( jager et al .\nin addition , caspase-14 is not expressed in the noncornifying keratinocytes of the sweat gland or the mouth epithelium ( lippens et al . , 2000 ;\nultrastructural analysis demonstrated that spatial distribution of caspase-14 in the epidermis and hair follicles is strongly conserved among several mammalian species ( alibardi et al .\ncaspase-14 was found to be associated with the nucleus , the keratohyalin granules , and the desmosomes , whereas in corneocytes , caspase-14 was found in the cytoplasm and was associated with corneodesmosomes ( a modified version of desmosomes ) and nuclear remnants .\nthese observations suggested a role for caspase-14 in nuclear degradation during cornification , but nuclear degradation was not affected in caspase-14deficient mice ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nthe expression of caspase-14 in the hassall 's bodies of the thymus and in the forestomach of rodents is somewhat expected , as they are cornifying structures and express the typical late differentiation markers , such as profilaggrin and loricrin , which are also found in the epidermis ( laster and haynes , 1986 ; favre , 1989 ; jarnik et al . , 1996 ) .\nprotein expression of caspase-14 has also been reported in several noncornifying tissues ( lippens et al . , 2003 ; krajewska et al . , 2004 , 2005 ; kam et al . , 2005\nhowever , these observations should be interpreted carefully , as we have recently shown that the reported expression of caspase-14 in such tissues can be the result of aspecific staining ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nremarkably , so far caspase-14 has been found only in terrestrial mammals but not in birds or reptiles .\nwhereas birds and reptiles have a stiff , dry , scaly epidermis , mammals have a soft stratum corneum because of the larger amounts of histidine - rich late differentiation markers ( e.g. , profilaggrin ; alibardi , 2003 ) .\ninterestingly , profilaggrin is a direct substrate of caspase-14 ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nthis could indicate that the occurrence of a soft stratum corneum and the caspase-14 gene are associated during evolution .\nalthough the expression of caspase-14 is very restricted , little is known about the transcriptional regulation of its gene . in vitro\n, caspase-14 is only expressed when keratinocytes are forced to differentiate by growing them postconfluently or in suspension or by adding vitamin d3 ( eckhart et al .\nin contrast , adding ca at high concentrations to the medium , a method frequently used to induce differentiation , did not induce caspase-14 expression ( eckhart et al .\nretinoids , which suppress keratinocyte differentiation , down - regulate caspase-14 expression ( rendl et al . ,\nthese results indicate that transcription factors that are specifically active during terminal differentiation are required to regulate caspase-14 expression . whether caspase-14 expression levels can be regulated at the posttranscriptional level is not known .\ndown - regulation of several differentiation - associated genes by retinoids has been shown to be mediated by the transrepression of activator protein 1 ( ap-1)mediated gene activation ( fisher and voorhees , 1996 ) .\nindeed , the caspase-14 promoter contains at least two potential ap-1binding sites ( unpublished data ) .\nthe green tea phenol ( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( egcg ) is a potent activator of ap-1 and has been shown to up - regulate caspase-14 in a p38- and jnk - dependent way ( hsu et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) .\nap-1 alone is probably not sufficient to drive caspase-14 expression because tnf and 12-o - tetradecanoyl - phorbol 13-acetate , two potent activators of ap-1 in keratinocytes ( arnott et al . , 2002 )\n, did not induce caspase-14 expression in keratinocytes ( lippens et al . , 2004 ) .\ndifferentiation - dependent expression of caspase-14 in keratinocytes could also result from a strong transcriptional repression in proliferating keratinocytes .\nthis possibility is supported by the observation that mice deficient in nuclear receptor corepressor hairless ( hr ) had 510-fold higher levels of caspase-14 and profilaggrin mrna , starting from postnatal day 6 and progressing during development ( zarach et al . , 2004 ) .\nthese alterations in gene expression were detected mainly in the keratinocytes of the utricle , an abnormal pouch - like structure at the upper part of the hair follicle . increased\ngene expression occurred before the morphologically distinct utricle could be identified , indicating that the up - regulation was probably a cause rather than a consequence of utricle formation\n. it would be interesting to analyze both caspase-14 activation and filaggrin processing in these mice .\nmultiple mutant hr alleles in mice and in humans show phenotypic variations that include congenital hair loss , skin wrinkling , and papular rash ( cichon et al . , 1998 ;\n1998 ) . whether caspase-14 overexpression is important for the observed phenotypes could be addressed by generating epidermis - specific caspase-14 transgenic mice or by crossing the hr mice with caspase-14deficient mice .\nprocaspases consist of a prodomain , a large subunit ( p20 ) , and a small subunit ( p10 ) .\nactivation of caspases is induced by dimerization , ( auto-)proteolytic cleavage at asp residues , and/or conformational changes ( lamkanfi et al . , 2003 ) .\nso far , maturation of caspase-14 by proteolytic cleavage into p20 and p10 subunits has been consistently observed only in cornifying epithelia such as the epidermis and the rodent forestomach ( lippens et al . , 2000 ;\nalthough some investigators suggested that caspase-8 and -10 can activate caspase-14 in vitro ( ahmad et al .\n, 1998 ; van de craen et al . , 1998 ) , this could not be confirmed by others ( lippens et al .\nfurthermore , caspase-14 is probably not proteolytically activated by a caspase in vivo , as other caspases are not activated during epidermal differentiation ( eckhart et al .\n2000 ; raymond et al . , 2007 ) , and caspase-14 is not processed at an aspartate residue like other caspases but is processed at ile in man and presumably at leu in the mouse ( chien et al . , 2002 ) .\nalignment of the protease - sensitive loop between the p20 and p10 subunits of the known mammalian procaspase-14 amino acid sequences ( fig .\n2 ) reveals a conserved hydrophobic patch that is n terminal of the caspase-14 cleavage site .\nthis patch contains p1-preferred amino acids of elastase - like serine proteases , such as val , ala , leu , and ile ( mallory and travis , 1975 ; vered et al . , 1985 ; takahashi et al . ,\n1989 ) , suggesting that a serine protease with elastase - like properties could be involved in caspase-14 activation ( unpublished data ) . all together ,\nthese data indicate that during skin homeostasis , the caspase-14activating protease is not a caspase , separating caspase-14 activation from the apoptotic and inflammatory caspase cascades that could be detrimental to epidermal integrity .\nthe precise epidermal layer in which caspase-14 is processed and activated is unknown because antiserum specifically recognizing activated caspase-14 is not yet available .\nhowever , the following findings indicate that activation of caspase-14 occurs at the interface between the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis or early during cornification .\nfirst , both the proform and activated form of caspase-14 can be found in total epidermal extracts , whereas in the cornified layer only activated caspase-14 is found ( fischer et al . , 2004 ) .\nsecond , caspase-14 activation coincides with stratum corneum formation both during embryonic development and in organotypic skin cultures ( eckhart et al .\nthis implies that the main biological function of caspase-14 is exercised in the stratum corneum , as proven by the phenotype of the caspase-14deficient mice ( see the next section ) .\nsequence analysis indicates that a hydrophobic patch in the protease - sensitive loop is conserved .\nonly part of the alignment is shown here , including the c - terminal part of the p20 subunit , the protease - sensitive loop , and the n - terminal part of the p10 subunit .\nthe darker the yellow , the more the amino acids are conserved between species . the catalytic qacrg box is delineated with a green box .\nthe conserved hydrophobic patch is delineated with a red box , and the cleavage site in human caspase-14 is indicated with a red arrow .\nthe alignment was performed using clustalw ( mega version 3.1 ; kumar et al . , 2004 ) and\nidentification of caspase-14 substrates has been hampered for a long time by the unavailability of enzymatically active caspase-14 .\nhowever , it was recently shown that proteolytically processed caspase-14 requires high concentrations of kosmotropic salt to be active in vitro , such as sodium citrate , in addition to proteolytic cleavage between the p20 and p10 subunit ( mikolajczyk et al . , 2004 ) .\nthese salts induce both dimerization and ordering of active site loops by partial desolvation of the protein to a more compact , catalytically active protease .\nthe cellular environment of the stratum corneum of the epidermis probably favors caspase-14 activity in a similar way .\nindeed , the water content decreases from 45% at the transitional layer to 1525% at the skin surface ( warner et al . , 1988 ; caspers et al . , 2001 ) .\nhuman caspase-14 preferentially accommodates tryptophan or tyrosine in the s4 subsite , whereas mouse caspase-14 is more tolerant , with almost equal preferences for -branched and aromatic amino acids ( mikolajczyk et al . , 2004 ) .\nfor example , both human and mouse caspase-14 efficiently cleave the fluorescent peptide substrate wehd - amc , but only mouse caspase-14 cleaves ietd - amc as efficiently ( fischer et al . , 2004 ; mikolajczyk et al . ,\nthese substrate preferences would classify human caspase-14 as an inflammatory caspase and mouse caspase-14 as an inflammatory and apoptotic initiator caspase ( thornberry et al .\n, 1997 ; thornberry , 1998 ) . however , human caspase-14 can not proteolytically activate the inflammatory cytokines pro \n2004 ) , and there are no data supporting a direct role for caspase-14 in apoptosis ( lippens et al . , 2000 ; denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nwhether the substrate preferences of human and murine caspase-14 observed in vitro on peptide substrates also occur in vivo is not clear .\nimportantly , profilaggrin , a major structural protein in the differentiating epidermis , has been shown to be a physiological substrate of caspase-14 ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nidentification of additional substrates and determination of the cleavage sites will provide more insight into the preferred recognition sequence of caspase-14 in the context of a protein .\nkeratinocytes can die by two different processes : apoptotic cell death induced by damaging agents such as uvb , chemicals , and cytotoxic cytokines or by a continuous process of differentiation leading to the formation of corneocytes .\nthese processes are clearly distinct pathways executed by different players ( for review see lippens et al . , 2005 ) , but the role of caspases in these two cell death programs has long been controversial .\nalthough almost all procaspases are constitutively expressed in the epidermis , only caspase-14 has consistently been shown to be activated during epidermal cornification ( eckhart et al .\n, 2000b ; lippens et al . , 2000 ; raymond et al . , 2007 ) .\nin addition , knockouts for apoptotic caspases were not reported to have a phenotypic skin anomaly except for caspase-3deficient mice , in which keratinocyte differentiation is delayed in the embryo but normalized at birth ( okuyama et al . , 2004 ) .\nhowever , others could not confirm the activation of caspase-3 during embryonic epidermal development ( fischer et al .\nalthough they are not activated during cornification , apoptotic caspases , in contrast to caspase-14 , become activated during uvb- , staurosporine- , tnf- , and tnf - related apoptosis - inducing ligand  induced apoptosis of keratinocytes and , thereby , play a role in the apoptotic cell death of keratinocytes ( for review see lippens et al . , 2005 ) .\nthus , we conclude that apoptotic caspases are not involved in the physiological keratinocyte cell death program leading to cornification .\nfurthermore , caspase-14deficient epidermal cells can undergo classical apoptosis , which genetically demonstrates that caspase-14 is dispensable for the apoptosis of keratinocytes . during development , caspase-14 protein expression is detectable from embryonic day ( e ) 15.5 on , and its processing is observed from e17.5 ( hu et al . , 1998 ; van de craen et al . , 1998 ; fischer et al . , 2005 ) , which coincides with stratum corneum formation and establishment of the epidermal barrier .\nhowever , no differences in outside - in barrier formation of the skin of caspase-14deficient mice during embryogenesis were observed ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nfurthermore , caspase-14deficient mice were born at the expected mendelian ratios , were fertile , and had long survival rates .\ndetailed analysis of caspase-14deficient mice indicated that caspase-14 has an important role in cornification , hydration , and uvb protection .\nthe skin of caspase-14deficient mice was shinier , characterized by deeper skin lines , and had larger scales ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) even though the shape and size of the cornified envelopes themselves were not altered .\nbiochemical analysis indicated that caspase-14 was responsible for the correct processing and degradation of ( pro)filaggrin , as epidermis lacking caspase-14 was characterized by an altered profilaggrin processing and staining pattern ( fig .\n3 ) and by the presence of aberrant keratohyalin granules , the profilaggrin storage granules . profilaggrin is a large , insoluble protein consisting of a calcium - binding a domain , a b domain , and several tandem repeats of filaggrin units . in the transitional layer\n4 ) , which aid in the bundling of keratin intermediate filaments and formation of the cornified envelope ( for review see candi et al . , 2005 ) .\nsubsequently , filaggrin is deiminated ( conversion of arginine to citrulline by elimination of the imino group of arginine by peptidylarginine deiminases ) , causing its release from keratin and allowing its degradation into free hygroscopic amino acids that act as natural moisturizing factors of the stratum corneum ( scott and harding , 1986 ; rawlings and matts , 2005 ) .\ntherefore , filaggrin plays an important role in skin hydration . although the filaggrin unit was detected in caspase-14deficient epidermis by western blot analysis , lower molecular weight filaggrin fragments were also present ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nimmunofluorescence analysis showed that in these mice , filaggrin immunoreactive fragments accumulated in the upper layers of the stratum corneum ( fig .\nthis indicates that the correct degradation of filaggrin into free amino acids was affected in caspase-14deficient skin .\ninterestingly , caspase-14 was found to be associated with keratohyalin granules in the stratum granulosum and to remain cytoplasmic in the stratum corneum ( alibardi et al . , 2004 ) , which could correlate with its possible involvement in the generation of free amino acids . expression of caspase-14 and ( pro)filaggrin in wild - type and caspase-14deficient skin .\nimmunofluorescence staining for caspase-14 ( red ) and ( pro)filaggrin ( green ) on paraffin sections of 5.5-d - old skin of both wild - type ( + /+ ) and caspase-14deficient ( / ) mice ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nfluorescence microscopy was performed on a cellm system ( olympus ) with an upright microscope ( bx61 ; olympus ) .\na specific dapi emission band - pass filter ( 450470 nm ) and a gfp emission band - pass filter ( 510550 nm ) were used .\nimage acquisition and processing were performed with the cellm software using a cooled ccd camera with a 1,344  1,024 pixel resolution .\nimage intensity scaling and color conversion were completed in imagej ( national institutes of health ) .\ncaspase-14 is expressed mainly in the spinous , granular , and cornified layers of wild - type mice and is absent in caspase-14deficient mice .\n( pro)filaggrin is expressed in the granular layer and in the lower cornified layer in wild - type skin . in caspase-14deficient skin , additional filaggrin\ncaspase-14 protects the skin against uvb photo damage and water loss and is involved in the processing of ( pro)filaggrin .\ncaspase-14 expression starts in the spinous layer ( indicated in shades of red ) , and cleavage into its p20 and p10 subunits occurs at the transition of the granular to the cornified layer .\ncaspase-14 is active in the dehydrating environment of the cornified layer , where it has an important function in formation of the epidermal barrier leading to protection against uvb and water loss ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nprofilaggrin is a large structural molecule consisting of an n - terminal a domain and a b domain followed by multiple filaggrin repeats and a unique c - terminal sequence ( for review see candi et al . , 2005 ) .\nprofilaggrin undergoes many posttranslational modifications , eventually leading to release from the keratin intermediate filaments ( see the section on the function of caspase-14 for details ) . in the lower stratum corneum\nthese amino acids compose 40% of the natural moisturizing factors present in the stratum corneum and are important for maintaining epidermal hydration ( rawlings and matts , 2005 ) . in caspase-14deficient skin ,\naccumulating filaggrin fragments are present ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) , indicating that an unidentified protease ( asterisk ) cleaves the filaggrin monomer into these fragments and that caspase-14 is responsible for the further processing and degradation of these fragments into free amino acids .\nas it is very unlikely that caspase-14 is directly responsible for degradation of the filaggrin fragments into free amino acids , we propose two possible mechanisms : ( 1 ) caspase-14 could first cleave these filaggrin fragments , leading to further degradation into free amino acids by another endo- and/or exopeptidase ; or ( 2 ) caspase-14 could directly or indirectly ( by inactivating an inhibitor ) activate an endo- and/or exopeptidase that further processes the smaller filaggrin fragments .\nkg , keratohyalin granule ;

koenig et al . , 2005 ; krajewska et al . , 2005 ) .\nin addition , caspase-14 mrna , together with keratin 1 and profilaggrin mrna , was decreased in murine uvb - induced squamous cell carcinoma , possibly reflecting reduced differentiation in the tumor ( rundhaug et al . , 2005 ) .\nfurthermore , in some cases , caspase-14 protein expression was associated with highly differentiated cornified areas of lung squamous cell carcinoma and cervix carcinoma ( koenig et al . , 2005 ) . however\n, caspase-14 activation in tumors has not been shown , and so it might not be responsible for the tumor phenotype .\npresumably , the ectopic caspase-14 expression is caused by the changed transcriptional activity in these epithelial tumors .\nmutations in the caspase-14 gene have not been found in human carcinomas except very rarely in colorectal tumors , which most probably were not the cause of altered caspase-14 expression ( koenig et al . , 2005 ;\nwe as well as other investigators demonstrated that caspase-14 expression is substantially down - regulated in psoriatic lesions but is unaffected in the nonlesional epidermis ( lippens et al . , 2000 , 2004 ;\npsoriasis is an autoimmune disease characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of keratinocytes and impaired cornification , which results in the aberrant presence of nuclei in the cornified layer , also called parakeratosis .\nalthough caspase-14 is absent in these parakeratotic regions , this is probably not the cause of the development of parakeratotic plaques , as caspase-14deficient mice did not show spontaneous parakeratosis ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) .\nmore likely , caspase-14 down - regulation results from the impairment of terminal differentiation or up - regulation of transcriptional repressors .\nthe absence of caspase-14 in psoriatic plaques may lead to the formation of a defective barrier and , therefore , to the aggravation of psoriatic lesions . treating the parakeratotic plaques of patients with a vitamin d3 analogue results in the up - regulation of caspase-14 and\nlikewise , in the flaky skin ( fsn / fsn ) mouse model of psoriasis , topical egcg treatment causes the up - regulation of caspase-14 and the amelioration of psoriasis ( hsu et al . , 2007 ) .\ninterestingly , the expression of junb is strongly down - regulated in psoriatic lesions , and inducible epidermal deletion of both junb and c - jun in mice results in a psoriatic phenotype ( zenz et al . , 2005 ) . because caspase-14 might be regulated by these transcription factors\n, it would be interesting to elucidate whether caspase-14 is down - regulated in junb / c - jun  deficient mice .\nrecent evidence sheds light on the crucial role of caspase-14 in the skin , but several major questions remain .\nactivation of caspase-14 occurs most probably at the interface between the granular and cornified layer , implicating a role for caspase-14 in the stratum corneum .\nit is now clear that the caspase-14activating protease is not a caspase but probably an epidermis - specific serine protease with elastase - like properties .\nthis is not surprising , as it has been known for a long time that serine proteases are of major importance in epidermal homeostasis .\ndetermination of the in vitro conditions for caspase-14 activity that mimic stratum corneum conditions , together with the generation of caspase-14deficient mice , led to the identification of ( pro)filaggrin as the first known physiological caspase-14 substrate .\nimportantly , caspase-14 seems to be involved in the correct processing of filaggrin preceding its degradation into free hygroscopic amino acids , which might explain its role in the prevention of water loss from the epidermis .\nproteomic approaches could lead to the identification of additional caspase-14 substrates , which would contribute to understanding the role of caspase-14 in the skin .\ncaspase-14 also protects against uvb - induced damage , which means that it is involved in the establishment of the biochemical or structural properties of the stratum corneum as a uvb filter . how caspase-14 establishes the uvb - filtering capacity of the corneum is not completely understood .\nan extensive biochemical analysis of caspase-14deficient epidermis could reveal these mechanisms . whether caspase-14 , its activating protease , or its substrates could be used as therapeutic agents or as targets to improve formation of the epidermal barrier is a challenging research goal ."}

{"id": 58, "text": "kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1)-nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) is a major cellular pathway that protect normal cells against oxidative and xenobiotic damage.1 nrf2 is an essential transcription factor for antioxidant and detoxification genes and is crucial for the chemopreventive effect of various phytochemicals against carcinogenesis .\nrepresentative chemopreventive agents that induce nrf2 include carotenoids , curcumins , cyclic lactones , diterpenes , dithiolethiones , epithionitriles , flavonoids , indoles , isothiocyanates , organosulfides , and phenols.2,3 accumulating evidences have demonstrated that phytochemicals can protect cells from oxidative stress related diseases including inflammatory , cardiovascular , and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer , through nrf2-dependent responses .\nparadoxically , recent researches demonstrated the dark side of nrf2.4 cancer cells acquire a growth advantage by eliminating keap1-mediated negative control of nrf2 , which leads to activation of the nrf2-dependent defense response.4 constitutive upregulation of nrf2 has been found in many types of cancers , including skin , breast , prostate , lung , head and neck , and endometrial cancer.5 overexpressed nrf2 provides a growth advantage for cancer cells by protecting those cells from oxidative stress and anticancer agents , thus contributing to chemoresistance.5 in this review , we summarize the therapeutic development of nrf2 inhibitors that enhance the efficacy of the current cancer treatments .\nnrf2 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor with 7 domains from neh1 to neh7 .\nneh1 has dna binding motifs.6 neh3 , neh4 , and neh5 have domains involved in the transactivation of nrf2 target genes by binding coactivators .\nneh2 has a major regulatory domain with 2 binding sites for keap1 named etge and dlg ( fig .\nkeap1 has 5 functional domains including kelch , intervening region ( ivr ) , broad complex / tramtrack , bric - a - brac domain ( btb ) , an n - terminal region ( ntr ) , and a c - terminal region ( ctr).3 cysteine residues of ivr play as a sensor for reactive oxygen species ( ros ) .\nthe btb domain has a cys151 residue and is responsible for nrf2 ubiquitination through binding to cullin e3 ubiquitin ligase ( cul3)-based ubiquitin e3 ligase ( fig .\n1a ) . under unstressed conditions , nrf2 forms a complex with keap1 , leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26s proteasome ( fig\n. 2a).7 upon exposure to a variety of stressors , including ros , toxicants , and carcinogens , nrf2 is released due to modification of the cysteine residues of keap1 ( fig .\n2b).8 two mechanistic models have been proposed for the regulation of nrf2 : the hinge and latch model and the keap - cul3 dissociation model.810 in the hinge and latch model , 2 binding motifs of the neh2 domain in nrf2 have different affinities.9 for the ubiquitination , both the dlg and etgf motifs should be occupied by keap1 proteins .\nros modify the cysteine residues of keap1 , leading to the release of the dlg motif ( latch ) without changing the etgf motif ( hinge ) on neh2 .\nanother model is the keap - cul3 dissociation model in which oxidative stress disrupts the keap1-cul3 e3 ligase interaction without changing the conformation of keap1.8 nrf2 stabilization with de novo synthesis increases the cytoplasmic level of nrf2 .\nnrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to an antioxidant response element ( are ) as a heterodimer with musculo - aponeurotic fibrosarcoma ( maf ) to recruit a transcriptional coactivator and promote thetranscription of various cytoprotective genes that are associated with antioxidant and detoxification enzymes . upon recovery of cellular redox homeostasis , keap1 translocates to the nucleus to dissociate nrf2 from the are resulting in degradation of nrf2.11\nnrf2 binds to ares in promoter regions of various genes that regulate the cellular response to oxidative and xenobiotic stress .\nnrf2 target genes include antioxidant genes and phase ii enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 ( ho-1 ) , nad(p)h : quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( nqo1 ) , glutathione s - transferase ( gst ) , and glutathione peroxidases .\nthe are - bearing genes that are regulated by nrf2 in humans have been studied using microarray analysis of genes induced by chemopreventive agents or knockout of keap1 in human cell lines.2 these genes can be categorized into 5 groups : antioxidant genes ( gclc , gclm , gpx2 , gsr , slc7a11 , srxn1 , and txnd1 ) , nadph - generating enzymes ( g6pd , me1 , and pgd ) , metal - binding proteins ( fth1 , ftl , mt1 , and mt2 ) , drug - metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters ( akr1b1 , akr1b10 , akr1c1 , akr1c2 , akr1c3 , akr1c4 , cbr1 , gstm3 , mrp2 , nq1 , and ptgr1 ) , and stress response proteins ( gadd45 , hmox1 , hsp40 , and hsp70).2 knockdown of keap1 in human keratinocytes resulted in upregulation of 23 mrnas while akr1b1 , akr1b10 , and akr1c1 were induced to the greatest extent , showing increases of between 12- and 16-fold indicating that aldo - keto reductases could be useful biomarkers for nrf2 activation.12 as keap1 is responsible for inhibitor kappa b ( ib ) kinase beta ( ikk- ) ubiquitination , upregulation of some of these genes could be attributable to the increase of nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf-b ) activity.13 expression profiling in mice has revealed that nrf2 regulates approximately 100 genes and that two - thirds of nrf2-target genes are not involved in detoxication or antioxidation . instead , many of the target genes are associated with inflammation and immunity proteins.2\nthe aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( ahr ) is a transcription factors that mediates the biological effects of its xenobiotic ligands including dioxin.14 the ahr activates the transcription of nqo1 and other genes through the xenobiotic - responsive element ( xre).15 ahr induces the direct binding of nrf2 to promoters or indirectly produces reactive intermediates that trigger the nrf2 signaling pathway.16 the cross - talk between nf-b and nrf2 is more complex .\nseveral chemopreventive agents , such as sulforaphane , epigallocatechin-3-gallate , and curcumin , induce nrf2 signaling with concomitant repression of nf-b.14 the nf-b p65 subunit re - presses the nrf2-are pathway by preventing creb binding protein ( cbp ) from binding nrf2 through competitive interaction or by promoting the recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 ( hdac3 ) , a corepressor , to the are.17 in chondrocyte apoptosis , shear - induced cyclooxygenase-2 , an nk-b target gene , can suppress phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase ( pi3k ) activity , causing a reduction in thenrf2-mediated transcriptional response.18 in contrast , nrf2 inhibits the activity of nf-b by attenuating phosphorylated ib .\nnrf-2 target genes , including ho-1 have been reported to negatively affect nf-b activation.19,20 p53 has been reported to suppress the nrf2-dependent transcription of antioxidant response genes by directly interacting with are - containing promoters .\nprevious studies have suggested that the function of this negative regulation is to prevent the formation of antioxidant environment , which could hinder the induction of apoptosis by p53.21 in contrast , direct targets of p53 could upregulate nrf2 activity .\nstudies have shown that p21 inhibits the degradation of nrf2 by interacting with the dlg motif , leading to upregulation of antioxidant genes.22 these dual functions of p53 toward nrf2 indicate that p53 may decide the fate of damaged cells whether to repair the damaged cells or apoptosis .\nnrf2 is also involved in autophagy by inducing p62 which is a receptor for autophagic degradation .\nas p62 could block binding between nrf2 and keap1 , p62 contributes to the activation of nrf2 target genes in response to oxidative stress creating a positive feedback loop.23\nthe association of nrf2 overexpression and chemoresistance has been reported in many cancers including non - small cell lung cancer , stomach cancer , endometrial cancer , and osteosarcoma.2427 overexpression of nrf2 target genes was also found in a variety of solid tumors.28 ho-1 overexpression was found in brain cancer , prostate cancer , and renal cancer.29,30 nqo1 is known to be overexpressed in hepatoblastoma , colon cancer , breast cancer , and non - small cell lung cancer.31 several mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of keap1-nrf2 signaling in cancer .\nmutation of keap1 can result in accumulation of nrf2 in nucleus through decreased degradation or inhibition of nuclear export.28 in non - small cell lung cancer , heterozygous mutation of keap1 ( 8% of patients ) was reported to be sufficient for nrf2 overexpression.32 in addition to lung cancer , mutations in the keap1 gene were found in various cancers including breast ( 2% ) , colon ( 8% ) , gastric ( 11% ) , liver ( 9% ) , ovary ( 19% ) , and prostate ( 8%).3336 mutations in the neh2 domain of nrf2 were found in lung ( 11% ) , cancer ( 6% ) , and head and neck cancers ( 25%).37,38 all of these mutations were somatic mutations .\nmutation of egfr , kras , braf , myc , and the bcr - abl fusion can activate nrf2 , resulting in enhancement of ros detoxification and other oncogenic roles of nrf2 , including chemoresistance.3941 furthermore , posttranslational modifications can activate the keap1-nrf2 signaling pathway .\nhypermethylation of the keap1 promoter was found in 47% of lung cancer patients and this feature was associated with poor outcome.42 epigenetic regulation of keap1 was also found in malignant glioma , colon cancer , and breast cancer.4345\nin addition to the upregulation of cytoprotective genes , constitutive expression of nrf2 may confer a survival advantage to cancer cells by promotion of cell proliferation , chemoresistance and inhibition of apoptosis .\nan active pi3k - akt pathway augments the nuclear accumulation of nrf2 which then re - directs glucose into the anabolic pathway to increase metabolism , indicating the reinforcement of metabolic reprogramming by nrf2.46 nrf2 could mediate cell proliferation with dual regulation through epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) signaling and keap1 interactions.39 in cells with the keap1 gene mutation ( a549 cells ) , activated nrf2 promotes cell proliferation independent of egfr signaling .\ntherefore , egfr tyrosine - kinase inhibitors are intrinsically ineffective in these types of non - small cell lung cancer.39 cancer metastasis and tumor progression requires the epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) and the loss of e - cadherin is considered to be a main event in emt . in hek293 cells , complex of e - cadherin and beta - catenin could bind to c - terminus of nrf2 preventing nuclear translocation of nrf2.47 as e - cadherin inhibits nrf2-mediated transcription , loss of e - cadherin could promote nrf2 translocation and confer an additional survival advantage to cancer cells.47 the keap1-nrf2 pathway is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by interacting with p53 and b cell lymphoma-2 ( bcl-2 ) .\np53 inhibits the activation of nrf2 target genes by direct interacting with are - containing promoters or activating p21.21 considering that p53-induced apoptosis requires the accumulation of ros , increased activity of antioxidant genes by nrf2 in cancer cells can inhibit p53 dependent apoptosis .\nbcl-2 can repress cell death by dimerization with bcl-2-associated x protein ( bax ) and the bcl-2 homology 2 ( bh2 ) domain of bcl-2 is required for this heterodimerization.48 it was found that keap1 binds to the bh2 domain and facilitates the ubiquitination of bcl-2 leading , to bax accumulation and enhanced apoptosis .\nthus , mutations in the keap1 binding site for bcl2 are responsible for the anti - apoptotic effect as well as overexpression of nrf2.49 moreover , it has been reported that nrf2 can directly activate the transcription of bcl-2 and bcl - xl.50,51 many studies have reported the association between nrf2 upregulation and chemoresistance in various cancers , including gastric cancer , osteosarcoma , non - small cell lung cancer , endometrial cancer , bladder cancer , and neuroblastoma.2427,52 platinum drugs generate electrophilic molecules that damage cancer cells .\nchemoresistance to these drugs can be explained by high expression of antioxidant nrf2 target genes.4 another mechanism of chemoresistance is the induction of the drug efflux pump family , which includes the mdr , by nrf2.53 some drugs , including hdac inhibitors , oxaliplatin , and proteasome inhibitors can induce nrf2 and thus decrease the effectiveness of chemotherapy.5456\nin light of the data presented in this review , nrf2 is an attractive molecular target for the inhibition of cancer .\nin contrast to nrf2 activators , including numerous phytochemicals , only a small number of nrf2 inhibitors have been identified ( table ) .\ntrigonelline , a coffee alkaloid , efficiently decreased basal and tertiary butylhydroquinone ( tbhq)-induced nrf2 activity in chemoresistant pancreatic carcinoma cell lines ( panc1 , colo357 , and miapaca2 ) which have high nrf2 activity . along with inhibiting nrf2\nthe sensitivity of all cell lines to anticancer drugs and tumor necrosis factor - related apoptosis inducing ligand ( trail)-induced apoptosis was enhanced by trigonelline.57 chrysin ( 5,7-dihydroxyflavone ) is a natural flavonoid that is found in many plant extracts . in doxorubicin\nresistant hepatocellular carcinoma cell line ( bel-7402/adm ) , chrysin significantly reduced nrf2 expression by downregulating the pi3k - akt and erk pathways.58 in that study , chrysin restored chemosensitivity by downregulating the nrf2-downstream genes such as ho-1 , akr1b10 , and mrp5 .\napigenin ( 4,5,7-trihydroxyflavone ) is a natural flavone that is present in many fruits and vegetables and has various biological activities , such as anti - inflammatory and antioxidant properties . in a study\nusing bel-7402/adm cell lines , apigenin reduced nrf2 expression as well as the expression of nrf2-downstream genes .\nwhen cells were treated with doxorubicin , apigenin showed a synergistic anti - tumor effect on bel-7402/adm cell lines , resulting in reduced cell proliferation and more substantially induced apoptosis.59 brusatol is a quassinoid that is extracted from brucea javanica .\nbrusatol reduced nrf-2 protein level without changing the keap1 level and sensitized various cells including hela , mda - mb-231 , and a549 to chemotherapeutic agents such as carboplatin , 5-fluorouracil , etoposide , and paclitaxel.60 the anticancer effect of brustalol mediated by nrf2 was confirmed in a xenograft model indicating that brusatol could be used to combat intrinsic resistance .\nascorbic acid is an antioxidant that can suppress the level of nrf2 . in the imatinib - resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line kcl22/sr ,\nbinding of nrf2 to the are of the gamma - glutamylcysteine synthetase gene promoter was much stronger than in the parental imatinib - sensitive cell line kcl22.61 furthermore , addition of ascorbic acid to kcl22/sr cells resulted in a decrease in nrf2-dna binding and partial restoration of imatinib sensitivity to kcl22/sr.61 luteolin ( 3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone ) is a polyphenolic flavonoid found in high concentrations in celery , green pepper , and parsley . in a study using a cell - based are - reporter assay ,\nluteolin was found to be a potent nrf2 inhibitor.62 in that study , luteolin significantly sensitized a549 cells to the anticancer drugs oxaliplatin , bleomycin , and doxorubicin indicating the potential application of luteolin as a natural sensitizer in chemotherapy .\nconstitutively expressed nrf2 can promote cancer cell proliferation and protect cells against oxidative stress and therapeutic agents .\nit must be kept in mind that chemopreventive agents including various phytochemicals can induce chemoresistance and tumor progression by activating the keap1-nrf2 pathway .\nhowever , it will be necessary to understand the molecular regulation of nrf2 and identifying the individualized status of nrf2 expression ."}

product , it may be a novel idea to preserve these lenticules on a long - term basis using cryopreservation for potential future use and research .\nfollowing establishment of one such tissue bank , we wanted to explore the possibility of use of such cryopreserved refractive lenticules for potential treatment of hyperopia and study the feasibility , safety , efficacy , and reproducibility of this new treatment .\ninitially , the amblyopic eyes were studied mainly for changes in refraction and topography following tissue addition .\nthere was also the goal of evaluating any loss of bcva and complications , such as haze and tissue rejection .\neven these patients benefited from the surgery , as their refractive error was corrected to their best spectacle - corrected visual acuity and reduced their dependence on eyeglasses . after reviewing the results for 6 months , the indications were extended to normal eyes and bilateral surgery .\nunlike myopia , the correction of hyperopia involves creation of a furrow - like ring zone in the paracentral zone of the cornea .\nboth photorefractive keratectomy and lasik are subtractive procedures that steepen the cornea by ablating the midperipheral tissue.14,15 this creates an abnormal hyperprolate shape of the cornea that is associated with significant regression , especially in higher degrees of refractive errors.16 it potentially leads to the induction of hoas like coma and spherical aberrations and loss of bcva.17 fili is an innovative technique based on barraquer 's law of thickness,18 whereby the cornea is made steeper by addition of a lenticule of known thickness and power into a pocket created in a patient 's cornea using the fs laser .\nthe concept is similar to epikeratophakia , used to treat aphakia in the past , which had its own disadvantages.19 a fs laser overcomes these problems by creating precise lenticules and incisions at an accurate depth . the lenticular tissue processing technique described by mohamed - noriega et al10\nwas modified in this study by replacing bovine serum albumin with human tissue culture media to eliminate the risk of transmission of zoonotic diseases or unexpected adverse reactions due to bovine serum .\nthe protocols of gradual staged thawing , which are essential for the whole cornea to prevent endothelial cell injury due to sudden thawing , were not strictly followed in this study .\nmicrobiological and cellular cultures were not deemed necessary , as the tissue processing and preservation were conducted under strict sterile conditions , and the tissue did not contain vital endothelial cells . also , previous studies have suggested that stromal keratocytes within the extracted lenticules remain viable and can be stimulated to proliferate in appropriate cell culture conditions , even after a prolonged period of cryopreservation.9,10 the change in asphericity after fili suggests an increase in the prolateness of the cornea , which is expected after tissue addition , although the observed change was not seen as much as it is after hyperopic lasik.20 the shape of the cornea is more natural after tissue addition compared with tissue subtraction , which does not lead to significant induction of hoas.21 the total hoas after fili remain within normal acceptable values and may be better than hyperopic lasik / photorefractive keratectomy.22,23 also , tissue addition may be more forgiving for mild decentration , which is not the case with hyperopic lasik\n. the rate of enhancement following hyperopic lasik can be up to 10% or more,24 especially in younger patients .\nafter tissue addition , significant changes in topography or regression are not expected ; thus , retreatment rates may be lower .\nepithelial thickness profile is more favorable , which , unlike hyperopic lasik , does not cause midperipheral epithelial hyperplasia to compensate for loss of stromal tissue , hence reducing chances of regression.25 problems of haze and flap - related issues like delayed healing , infection , and dislocation are eliminated , thereby leading to greater patient comfort and faster recovery .\na fairly good refractive predictability was observed with this technique in the treatment of moderate hyperopia , although results were not highly accurate for correcting very high hyperopia ( eg , aphakia ) . in a case study reported by pradhan\net al,4 a 10 d lenticule was implanted to achieve correction of aphakia but had a high residual refraction of + 5 d. there are possible explanations for this result .\nfirst , the technique of pradhan et al of pocket creation was different from the technique used in this study . in the said study ,\na smile lenticule was first created , followed by dissection of the anterior plane to create a pocket , thus making 2 planes that could possibly cause weakening of the cornea .\nsecond , the optical zone of the lenticule in the study of pradhan et al was 5.7 mm compared with 6 mm in the current aphakia case , causing comparatively less volume of tissue addition .\nthe correction is expected to be relatively higher in larger lenticules because there is more volume of the tissue added . in this hyperopic series ,\nthe lenticule size ranged from 6.3 to 6.8 mm . also , the posterior curvature changes as described in the case study of pradhan et al reduced the effect on anterior curvature .\nthis was also probably the cause of the high + 4.1 d residual refraction in the current study .\nafter compensation , implantation of lenticule of approximately 12.5 d is required , and this is currently not possible with visumax .\nthe biomechanics of corneas in these patients were not studied due to lack of equipment such as the corvis ( oculus optikgerte gmbh , wetzlar , germany ) . however , because most of the bowman layer is preserved and tissue is being added , it is assumed that the biomechanics are more stable than lasik , where a flap is cut and tissue is subtracted from the periphery.26 the procedure certainly amounts to corneal transplantation and thus , theoretically carries the risk of future rejection .\nhowever , unlike traditional full thickness grafts , which have a graft  host junction proximal to host limbus , in this technique , the lenticule was well protected in the host corneal pocket and did not come in direct contact with the host 's limbal vasculature and immune system , making the risk of allogeneic graft rejection remotely possible.27 also , the lenticule was mainly stromal collagen tissue ; the incidence of rejection is significantly low in such a scenario compared with endothelial rejection .\nbecause no sutures are applied , there are no suture - related complications such as loosening , vascularization , or infection that would potentially trigger graft rejection.28 nevertheless , there is a need to monitor for signs of rejection and treat it like allogeneic graft rejection should rejection occur .\nbecause it is a reversible procedure , the lenticule can always be explanted in the event of any adverse effects or rejection in future .\nthe preliminary results of fili in hyperopia indicate that this may be a better technique than hyperopic lasik for moderate hyperopia in terms of stability , regression , aberrations , and postoperative dry eye .\nalthough it is a bit early to exactly predict the refractive outcomes , initial data indicate that the cryopreservation technique used is safe in heterologous individuals .\nfurther studies with a larger cohort and modification of the surgical technique with a goal of reducing postoperative astigmatism and refining nomograms are suggested to determine the long - term safety and refractive effects on the cornea and establish the technique as a valid option to treat hyperopia ."}

it decreased in survival group , but it even increased in the nonsurvival group .\nsome studies failed to find the association between strem-1 and poor outcome [ 8 , 13 ] . at a cutoff of 252.05 \npg / ml , strem-1 measurements yielded a sensitivity of 85.7% , specificity of 75.7% , positive predictive value of 70.6% , negative predictive value of 88.2% , and an accuracy of 79.4% for differentiating nonsurvivors from survivors .\npct is normally produced in the c cells of the thyroid gland ; plasma pct levels in healthy humans are approximately 550  pg / ml in normal state ; its half - time is about 2233 hours in serum .\nmany tissues and cells except thyroid gland produce and release that pct on systemic inflammation . several previous studies reported pct could serve as a useful tool to distinguish sepsis from systemic inflammatory response syndrome [ 15 , 16 ] . on the other hand , pct could reflect the severity of sepsis and outcome .\na study by christophe clec'h and coworkers found that serum pct on day 1 was significantly higher in patients with than without septic shock .\nmeanwhile , among patients with sepsis , pct concentrations were significantly higher in those who died than in the survivors , at all four measurement time points .\nsimilar results were drawn from other investigations [ 16 , 18 ] . very few studies failed to find the prognostic value . at a cutoff of 10.64  ng\n/ ml , procalcitonin measurements yielded a sensitivity of 76.2% , specificity of 81.7% , positive predictive value of 53.5% , negative predictive value of 67.8% , and an accuracy of 61.8% for differentiating nonsurvivors from survivors .\nnt - pro - bnp has been found to be a useful markers in the diagnosis , management , and prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure and was secreted into blood in response to atrial or ventricular wall stretch .\na recent meta - analysis suggested that an elevated nt - pro - bnp level may prove to be a powerful predictor of mortality in septic patients . in our study\n, there was no difference in nt - pro - bnp level between groups on day 1 , but the nt - pro - bnp levels in the nonsurvival group were higher than those in the survival group on days 3 and 5 .\nmeanwhile , serum nt - pro - bnp level showed a decreased trend in the survival group , but there was no decrease tendency in the nonsurvival group .\nwe concluded that nt - pro - bnp may predict sepsis 28-day mortality in different stages .\none research demonstrated that elevated serum nt - pro - bnp value represented an independent predictor for poor icu outcome in the presence of clinical severity scores ; the cut - off in admission nt - pro - bnp that best predicted outcome was 941  pg / ml .\ncrp is an acute phase protein and a sensitive systemic marker of inflammation and tissue damage .\nthe secretion of crp begins within 46  h after stimulus , doubles every 8  h thereafter , and peaks at 3650  h .\nthe role of crp in sepsis prognostic value seemed different . in our study , there was no significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors during the three measures , similar to previous study , indicating that crp was just an inflammatory biomarker and failed in reflecting sepsis severity .\nhave reported that crp levels in severe sepsis were lower than those in sepsis , suggesting that crp levels did not reflect the severity of sepsis . il-6 and il-10 are important proinflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines in sepsis . in our study , serum il-6 levels of patients in the nonsurvival group were significantly higher than those in the survival group on days 1 , 3 , and 5 .\nthe above results showed that il-6 had the prognostic utility for sepsis , whereas il-10 did not show the power .\nsurez - santamar and coworkers   enrolled 253 hospitalized septic patients ; they found that il-10 and il-6 were the best predictors , whereas pct showed only moderate predictive value for mortality .\nanother study investigated the prognostic value of il-6 , pct , and crp in critically ill patients during the first increase of fever ; only il-6 levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors , in which prognostic value was superior to pct and crp . in contrast , kawczyski and polakowska   indicated that the predictive value of il-10 plasma concentration was better than that of il-6 . to sum up ,\nstrem-1 , pct , and il-6 serum values attribute to the prognosis of sepsis during the time course .\nthe dynamic changes of biomarkers and cytokines were more meaningful for predicting the sepsis procession .\nschneider and coworkers   retrospectively analyzed the relationships between serum pct , il-6 , and apacheii score and prognosis of 220 patients on the first day after operation .\nthey found that pct was the sole independent predictor of 28-day mortality , in which prognostic ability was superior to those of il-6 and apacheii score .\nzhang et al .   suggested that serum strem-1 levels reflected the severity of sepsis more accurately than those of pct and crp and were more sensitive for dynamic evaluations of sepsis prognosis .\nfacing the results , we wonder which was the best predictor and how to combine them together and which was more valuable compared to clinical severity scores .\napache ii and sofa scores have been widely used to validate mortality risk stratification . in our study , we used roc and logistic regression model to search for the best predictor .\nbased on roc analysis , strem-1 and pct showed the equal prognostic ability ( 0.792 for pct , 0.862 for strem-1 , p = 0.291 ) , whereas their prognostic utility was inferior to that of apacheii and sofa scores which had equal power to predict outcome ( 0.923 for apacheii score , 0.953 for sofa score , p = 0.375 ) .\nlogistic regression model showed that serum strem-1 , pct , and sofa score were the independent predictors of 28-day mortality , which was supported by other result .\nas far as we know , the interrelationship between strem-1 , pct , nt - pro - bnp , cytokines , and clinical severity scores for mortality prediction in general icu patients has not been previously evaluated .\nour research firstly discovered that strem-1 and pct had the equal prognostic ability for sepsis mortality and were superior to other parameters .\nprevious study has indicated that the iteraction of trem-1 and interact adaptor protein dap12 can stimulate neutrophil and monocyte - mediated inflammatory response via the triggering and release of pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines .\nstrem-1 increases quickly when exposued to infection , and its half - time is short . in bacterial infections ,\nserum pct levels start to rise at 4  h after the onset of systemic infection and peak at between 8 and 24  h ; it decreased 50% every 24 hours along with therapy .\nin contrast , crp rises slowly and peaks 36  h after an endotoxin challenge .\nthe mechanism of nt - pro - bnp release in sepsis is complex , and kinetics characteristic is unknown . il-6 and il-10 rise quickly and peak at 24 hours and maintain a short time .\nthe patients admitted to icu often delayed more than 24 hours , either crp or cytokines serum concentration was unable to reach the peak at the period of sepsis .\nof course , the exact roles of biomarkers and cytokines in sepsis process are not clear , and need to be further studied .\nfirstly , our study chosen a part of sepsis biomarkers and did not put all biomarkers in the research .\nof course , it was a costly and unnecessary task to do so . secondly , every biomarker has its own dynamic characteristics ; meanwhile the patients were not in the same sepsis stages in the study ; thus the explanation for the results would be influenced .\nthirdly , we excluded patients with previous heart diseases history , but we did not perform the ucg to evaluate cardiac function .\nfinally , the sample size of the study was small and larger studies are needed .\nin summary , elevated serum strem-1 and pct levels provide superior prognostic accuracy to other biomarkers . combination of serum strem-1 and pct levels and sofa score can offer the best powerful prognostic for sepsis mortality . in the future , in order to improve the accuracy of the prognosis of sepsis , the combination of novel biomarkers and traditional markers of sepsis , reflecting different aspects of sepsis , is an attractive advice and is worthy of further investigation ."}

exposure and heat acclimatization on performance and pacing during outdoor cycling tt in experienced cyclists .\nthe cyclists initiated all tt in the heat with a similar power output as maintained during the first 20% of ttc .\nhowever , while maintaining similar hr , they subsequently experienced a marked decrease in power output and speed in the heat .\nthese decrements were progressively

decreased by 16%  5% in unacclimatized cyclists .\nthis decrement in power output for an increase in air temperature of approximately 28c between ttc and tth-1 represents an average decrement in performance of 0.5% per 1c increase . even if this decrement is not linear , as the effect of an absolute increase in air temperature is more important in warm than in cold environments ( 13 ) , this rate is comparable with the decrements reported during laboratory tt ( 0.3% to 0.9% per 1c ( 12,23,24,32 ) .\nin addition , the current study quantified the effects of heat stress on performance at different acclimatization stages . to date , most studies investigating the effects of heat on performance have examined unacclimatized participants .\nthese have shown that artificial heat acclimatization increases the ability to cycle in a hot laboratory ( 18,21 ) and that natural heat acclimatization increases physical performance during sporting activities in hot environments (

exercise mediates a decrease in maximal aerobic capacity , resulting in an increase in relative intensity for a given absolute work rate .\nalthough power output decreases during prolonged self -

does not typically decrease in the first approximately 15 min of exercise in the heat ( 27,29,35 ) , athletes seem to adopt a relative intensity associated with this critical power output . as vo2max progressively decreases with the development of thermal and cardiovascular strain in the heat , the maintenance of a similar relative intensity requires reduction in power output ( 24 ) .\nhowever , given the role of previous experiences on pacing ( 30 ) , one would expect that the large decrease in power output experienced by the athletes during tth-1 would have led to a conservative start during tth-2 .\ninitial power output was similar between trials and decreased thereafter in relation to acclimatization state .\nindeed , early studies suggest that heat acclimatization attenuates the circulatory strain associated with thermoregulation ( 19 ) , allowing normalization of the relation between physiological responses and work intensity ( 10 ) .\nconsequently , the cyclists seem to have finished all tt at a similar relative intensity , as suggested by hr and the similar core temperatures recorded upon completion but at a higher power output as acclimatization progressed . of

would also have lead to increase in skin temperature and blood flow .\nthe current study is the first to investigate cycling performance during outdoor tt in a hot environment .\n. however , the evaporative capacity of the environment is improved with higher air velocities , reducing heat stress and dehydration during outdoor cycling compared with indoor laboratory - based experiments ( 28 )

they wore short tights and a jersey with short sleeves in the heat ( except one cyclist who was consistently using white long sleeves ) .\ntherefore , it can not be ruled out that overall performance may be optimized in a slightly warmer temperature than in the ttc conditions of the current study .\ninterestingly , the detrimental effect of hot ambient conditions on speed was not as important as that on power output ( table 1 ) .\nthe different relations between the environment and speed and power output could be partly related to a temperature effect on air density , as the aerodynamic drag of a cyclist is related to air density and temperature ( 3,9,17 ) . for example , at an air temperature of 11c , the temperature reported to optimize laboratory cycling capacity ( 14 ) , air density is approximately 1.245 kgm at sea level .\nin contrast , air density drops to approximately 1.165 kgm at a temperature of 30c , reducing the drag force by approximately 6% .\nconsequently , the

proportion of optic radiation , whereas only a small proportion of radiation the filter is exposed to is reflected .\nthis is an undesirable phenomenon , contributing to deterioration of the filter user 's comfort .\nreflective metallic filters are obtained by deposition of a metallic layer of copper ( cu ) or gold ( au ) on mineral or organic bases .\nsuch filters take advantage of the characteristic properties of the metals used in their production , i.e. , significant reflection coefficient for ir radiation and significant transmittance for the vis spectrum . despite the fact that the technique of deposition of interference layers has been known for many years   the application of thin film ir filters in eye protections to block\nthe previous papers published by the authors of this study   contain descriptions of the structure of interference filters designed for application in eye protections \nhighly effective in reduction of ir radiation with high level of transmission of the vis spectrum .\nthe authors investigated also the optical and mechanical parameters of the newly developed protective optic filters manufactured with the use of interference technologies .\nthe analysis of the results of the conducted tests demonstrated numerous advantages of interference technology application in the construction of protective filters , including : improved resistance to damage of the external protective filter surface ( cracking , scratching etc . ) as well as high reflection coefficients for the nir spectrum .\nthe aim of the present study was to compare the optic properties of protective filters manufactured by taking advantage of the interference technology and those coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation .\nthe coefficients characterizing their optic parameters , allowing to assess the protective properties within the vis and ir spectrum range were compared .\nthe following coefficients were analysed : \n luminous

on the basis of luminous transmittance ( the higher protection level correlates with the higher level of ir radiation blocked and appropriately lower vis light transmittance ) .\nprotection level consists of a code number ( e.g. , 4 ) for ir filters and a shade number ( e.g. , 3 , 5 , 7 ) calculated according to the following equation : \n ( 1 ) \n where  \n v \n =  luminous transmittance . for the particular level of protection , the mean ir transmittance within the 7801400 and 7802000  nm ranges as well as the ir reflectance and absorptance within the 7802000  nm range are determined .\nfor comparative analysis of the metallic reflective filters available in the market versus the interference filters developed by the authors , the following samples were prepared for the tests : \n

exposure to an excessive amount of radiation from this range\ncan result in burns of the retina and , in extreme cases , its permanent damage .\n, chronic long - term exposure may lead to the development of cataracts , referred to as ir or glass worker 's cataracts . in view of the above\nthe results presented on the graphs in figure 1 and the determined transmittance values ( see table 2 ) indicate unequivocally more effective blocking of ir radiation provided by interference filters .\nthe values of  \n a and  \n n for interference filters are lower even by an order of magnitude than those obtained for the metallic reflective filters .\nfor instance , the mean value of ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range for interference filters with protection level 4 - 5 ( one of the most common protection levels used in the metallurgic industry ) equals 0.006% and is significantly lower than the maximum acceptable value specified in , which is 10.6% .\nfor all the investigated filters , the values of r \n n exceed 60% , which classifies them in the group of filters with increased ir reflectance .\nthe levels of the ir absorptance for metallic reflective filters and interference filters of 4 - 3 and 4 - 5 protection class are similar . for the highest of the investigated protection levels  4 - 7 \nthe above findings are important for selection of a filter appropriate for the radiation source .\nthe selection of filter protection level is dependent on the temperature of the radiation source .\nthe 4 - 7 level is used for radiation sources whose temperature exceeds 1600  k ( e.g. , occurs in the metallurgical industry ) . with such high temperatures ,\nreduction of filter heating as a result of exposure to ir radiation is important . as it follows from comparative analysis of the optic properties of filters taking advantage of the interference technology and filters coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation\n, the interference filters provide a more effective blocking of ir radiation in comparison with the currently used protective filters ."}

{"id": 65, "text": "endotracheal intubation is one of the most important skills for anesthesiologists in securing the airway during general anesthesia and resuscitation .\nfailure to secure the airway can cause anesthesia - related life - threatening morbidity and mortality .\nhowever , the difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation rate still remains at 1.513% due to poor reliability of traditional protocols , algorithms , and combinations of screening tools in identifying a potentially difficult airway .\ndue to the portable , noninvasive characteristics , point - of - care ultrasound ( us ) technique has been widely used in the operating room for ultrasound - guided nerve block , central venous access , and pneumothorax diagnosis . with improved visualization of airway structures ,\nprasad et al . first found that us can reliably image all of the structures visualized by ct , and the infrahyoid airway structure parameters measured by ultrasound agree well with the parameters measured by ct .\nadhikari et al . further demonstrated that the anterior neck soft tissue thickness measured by ultrasound at hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an index to predict difficult laryngoscopy , but only the anterior neck soft tissue thickness at thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy .\ninterestingly , they did not find a correlation between us measurements and clinical screening tests .\n.   also found that an abundance of fat tissue at the anterior neck region as detected by ultrasound in israeli obesity patients was a very good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy , being a much better predictor than body mass index ( bmi ) per se .\nhowever , a similar study in the unites states showed that us quantification of anterior soft tissue and general bedside screening tests failed to predict difficult laryngoscopy in american obese patients , suggesting that racial or body shape differences might exist . to define the role of airway us in predicting difficult laryngoscopy\n, we evaluated the feasibility of ultrasound in predicting difficult laryngoscopy

differences were noted in sex , age , and height , but bw and bmi values in the difficult laryngoscopy group were higher . the bmi value was 25.632.80 kg / m for the difficult laryngoscopy group , and 23.613.43 kg / m for the easy laryngoscopy group ( p<0.05 ) .\nairway evaluation parameters , including mms , tmd , iig , dshb , dsem , and dsac , are shown in table 2 .\nthe thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue measured by us were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group compared to the easy laryngoscopy group at the level of the hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure .\nhowever , no statistically significant difference was found between easy and difficult laryngoscopy groups for tmd and iig .\na strong positive correlation existed between dsem and dshb ; moderate positive correlations between dsem and dsac , dshb and dsac ; small positive correlations between mms and dshb , mms and dsem , mms and dsac ; and very small positive correlations between tmd and iig

tmd and dsac ( data not shown ) . to further assess the roles of mms , iig , tmd , dshb , dsem , and dsac in predicting difficult laryngoscopy ,\nthe roc curves ( figure 4 ) were drawn using medcalc software with laryngoscopy grade over ii as the threshold of difficult laryngoscopy . as determined by the youden index , the optimal cutoff values ( with sensitivity and specificity in parentheses ) for mms , iig , tmd , dshb , dsem , and dsac to predict difficult laryngoscopy were over 2 ( 50.0% , 82.3% ) , 3.8 cm ( 75.0% , 48.0% ) , 5.9 cm ( 21.4% , 93.7% ) , 1.28 cm ( 85.7% , 85.1% ) , 1.78 cm ( 100.0% , 66.3% ) , and 1.1 cm ( 75.0% , 80.6% ) , respectively .\nthe areas under the roc curve ( aucs ) were significantly different from the area under the reference line ( area=0.5 ) for mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac ; and the p values of mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac were all less than 0.0001 .\nno difference between the aucs of tmd , iig , and the area under the reference line were identified , suggesting that mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac might be better than tmd and iig in predicting difficult laryngoscopy ( table 3 ) .\nwith the rapid expansion of portable us in anesthesia for guiding the placement of central venous catheters and the performance of regional block [ 1113 ] , some preliminary results exploring the feasibility of portable us in airway evaluation and management have been reported , even though the air attenuates us transmission and thereby creates artifacts [ 35,14,15 ] . in the present study , we compared the role of the us measurements and traditional screening tests , including iig , tmd , and mms , in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in a chinese han population .\nwe found that strong positive linear correlations existed among the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue measured by us at hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels .\nthe aucs of mms , dshb , dsem , and dsac are all over 0.7 , indicating they are all good parameters in predicting difficult laryngoscopy .\nthe aucs of tmd and iig were less than 0.7 , suggesting that tmd and iig were poor parameters in predicating difficult laryngoscopy . to clearly visualize the glottis and smoothly finish the intubation procedure , anesthesiologists need to place the laryngoscope blade to the base of the epiglottis , and then lift it up\ntherefore , in addition to the performer s skills and experience , many factors , including dental status , mouth opening , oropharyngeal space , mandibular space , and neck motility , are all involved this complicated procedure .\nmms mainly reflects the size of the tongue relative to the oral cavity , or the oropharyngeal space [ 1820 ] , iig means the mouth opening , and tmd can reflect the length of the neck .\nthe mallapati score was first introduced by mallampati et al . in 1985 , and then modified by samsoon and young in 1987 . due to the simple and clear evaluation standards , mms has become one of the most commonly used tools to predict a difficult airway .\nhowever , mms mainly depends on patient cooperation and body position , which can greatly affect the accuracy of airway evaluation .\ntherefore , mms has been reported to be a good predictor by many , but was found to be of limited value by others . a recent meta - analysis involving 177 088 patients\ndemonstrate that mms is inadequate as a stand - alone test to predict difficult laryngoscopy or tracheal intubation , but it may well be a part of a multifactorial model for the prediction of a difficult tracheal intubation .\niig has been repeatedly reported to be associated with difficult intubation , but our results showed that there was no significant difference in mean iig between difficult and easy laryngoscopy groups ( 3.740.43 vs. 3.860.47 cm ) .\nfurthermore , the auc of iig was 0.580.06 , which was far less than 0.7 , suggesting that iig might be not a good screening parameter for predicting difficult laryngoscopy in our study .\nour iig conclusion was similar to the previous report by savva , but different from results of other studies .\nwhether this difference was really caused by racial factors requires further investigation because the measurements of iig need patients to fully cooperate .\ntmd is also used as a screening test to predict difficult airway , but our results suggest that tmd is not a useful screening test .\nhowever , we could not determine whether this was because of limited patient numbers or because tmd was not useful in predicting difficult airway due to the small sample size .\nct , mri , and other imaging techniques can accurately measure the thickness of anterior neck soft tissue , but they are expensive and unavailable in many operating rooms .\nportable us is inexpensive , rapid , and convenient to perform in the operating room , and most importantly , it can quantify the neck fat thickness as accurately as mi .\nhowever , the results of 2 prior studies focusing on soft tissue thickness at and below the level of the vocal cords in a specific group of obese patients are inconsistent .\nfurther measured the anterior neck soft tissue at the hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels , which is important to displace the glottis by the laryngoscopic blade , and found that us measurements of anterior neck soft tissue thickness at the level of hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane can be used to predict difficult laryngoscopies , and a 2.8-cm us measurement at the thyrohyoid membrane was a good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy .\nour results show that the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue at the level of the hyoid bone ( 1.51 [ 95% ci=1.401.61 ] cm vs. 0.98 [ 95% ci=0.941.02 ] cm ) , the thyrohyoid membrane ( 2.39 [ 95% ci=2.172.62 ] cm vs. 1.49 [ 95% ci=1.431.55 ] cm ) , and the anterior commissure ( 1.30 [ 95% ci=1.181.42 ] cm vs. 0.92 [ 95% ci=0.870.94 ] cm ) were greater in the difficult laryngoscopy group and were significantly correlated .\nfurthermore , the ranges of anterior neck soft tissue for those with difficult laryngoscopy were mutually exclusive from those patients with an easy laryngoscopy , indicating that they are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy , even though the ranges of these 3 parameters were smaller than in a previous report .\nglottis exposure by place laryngoscope is a very complicated procedure , and many subjective and objective factors such as the provider s skills and experience , airway secretions , and abnormalities of anatomical structures are involved in this procedure .\nthe investigators were not totally blinded to the study purpose , and some clinical signs might indicate the possibility of difficult laryngoscopy , which can cause some bias during us measurements . due to the low incidence of difficult laryngoscopy , it is impossible for us to randomly assign an equal number of patients to both groups , thus there were 28 patients in the difficult group and 175 patients in the easy group .\nanterior neck soft tissue thicknesses measured by us at the hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels are independent predictors of difficult laryngoscopy . the commonly used screening tests for difficult intubation have only poor - to - moderate predictive power when used alone .\ncombinations of these screening tests or risk factors with us measurements might increase the ability to predict difficult laryngoscopy ."}

controlled study was carried out on 96 patients ( 77 men and 19 women ; age : 35 - 78 years ; mean : 58.1 years ) .\nthe patients , undergoing cas performed by the same surgical team between march 2012 and january 2013 in istanbul mehmet akif ersoy thoracic and cardiovascular surgery research and training hospital , were assigned to 3 groups .\nafter the study had received the approval of the institutional review board , informed consent was obtained from all patients .\nthe treating physician did not know the groups to which individual patients had been assigned . patients with renal failure ,\nhyperthyroidism , emergency cas , history of cardiac operations associated with valvular heart disease , low ejection fraction ( < 35% ) , and preoperative atrial fibrillation or other rhythm disorders , as well as patients who did not provide research authorization , were excluded from the study .\nthe study groups included patients after pp ( group i , n = 30 ) , a control group ( group ii , n = 33 ) , and patients without pp who received posterior pericardial tubes ( the tube was placed behind the heart and sutured to the adjacent pericardial tissue to avoid tube - induced ventricular arrhythmias ) ( group iii , n = 33 ) .\ni , a 4-cm longitudinal incision was made parallel and posterior to the left phrenic nerve , extending from the left inferior pulmonary vein to the diaphragm , as described by mulay et al . .\nin group i , the relationship between the location of the distal part of circumflex anastomosis and pp was also carefully considered .\nmoreover , all patients underwent pleurotomy and lateral pericardiotomy ( approximately 3.5 - 4.5 cm in size ) in which the internal thoracic artery ( ita ) was used for anastomosis and positioned medially to the lung , which allowed the ita to run without kinking or twisting .\nthe inferior part of the pericardium was left open ( 2 cm ) in our study .\na straight tube was placed in the anterior mediastinum and an angled tube was placed in the left hemithorax in all patients .\nthe same postoperative pain management protocol was provided for all patients . after a routine closure of the chest\n, drains were frequently milked and stripped to ensure tube patency during the intensive care unit stay .\nthe chest tubes were removed on the 2 postoperative day when the drainage became serous ; otherwise , they remained in use for one or more days .\npericardial effusion was defined as the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space determined by transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) .\nthe presence of pericardial effusion on 2-dimensional tte was assessed using the criteria previously described by bakhshandeh et al . .\ntwo - dimensional echocardiography was performed on postoperative days 1 and 5 , as well as 1 month after surgery .\nthe maximum diastolic separation between the pericardium and epicardium was measured at the tip of the mitral valve leaflet .\nwhen the diastolic echo - free space between the left ventricular posterior wall and the pericardium was < 10 mm , the pericardial effusion was classified as small .\nwhen the space was 10 - 20 mm , the effusion was classified as moderate , while for spaces > 20 mm , the effusion was classified as severe .\nif the diagnosis of evident pericardial effusion ( moderate or severe ) was established , tte was performed daily , and the volume of the effusion was observed closely .\nwe compared the groups with regard to the volume of effusion on postoperative days 1 , 5 , and 30 .\npatients with no or small pericardial effusion and an uneventful postoperative course were discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5 .\npatients with moderate and severe pericardial effusion were treated with non -

cardiotomy syndrome .\nhowever , clinically significant pericardial effusion occurs rarely and can be a crucial risk factor for cardiac tamponade ( 1% ) .\nposterior pericardiotomy has been reported to reduce the prevalence of pericardial effusion from 40% to 8% with a simultaneous reduction in the prevalence of svt ( supraventricular tachycardia ) .\nthe semi - sitting position helps thoracic drainage in the early postoperative period by supporting the patient 's back . despite all the above - mentioned measures , the posterior wall of the pericardial sac forms an unprotected space that may cause pericardial effusion to develop septae .\nthis leads to the appearance of adhesions preventing blood drainage , leading to cardiac compression .\nmoreover , the collection of fluid may persist due to bleeding resulting from the use of anticoagulants .\nin fact , anti - coagulants ( low - molecular - weight heparin ) were used postoperatively in our patients with atrial fibrillation .\nposterior pericardial effusion can be evacuated by placing a tube in the posterior pericardial space .\nthe placement of the pericardial tube is simple to perform , but it may have certain drawbacks . the tube may come into contact with coronary grafts during cardiac activity or movement .\nhowever , the patients included in the study ( in group iii as well as the other groups ) did not exhibit any arrhythmias ( apart from af ) or ischemic changes\n. this may be due to the fact that we fixed the pericardial tube to the surface of the diaphragmatic pericardium with polypropylene .\npp or the use of posterior tubes may lessen the volume of pericardial effusion after cas .\nmoreover , patients in group i exhibited regression of pericardial effusion during 30 postoperative days .\nthis proved that pp had a lasting effect on pericardial effusion , as presented by figure 1 .\nwhat stands out in our results is that pericardial effusion may occur if no intervention is performed on the posterior part of the pericardium .\nthis technique is suggested in both cas and valve surgery , but it is not routinely used [ 13 , 14 ] .\nwhat is more , pp is recommended by the american college of chest physicians guidelines and by some authors as a preventive technique for postoperative atrial fibrillation [ 15 , 16 ] .\nsupraventricular tachyarrhythmias , mainly in the form of atrial fibrillation , occur in up to 40% of patients undergoing cas .\nalthough af is usually benign , it can cause hemodynamic instability , prolonged hospital stay , and increased cost and , in rare cases , predispose to cerebrovascular accidents .\nthe antiarrhythmic effect of pp may , however , be a theoretical issue , as we observed similar results regarding atrial fibrillation in all the groups .\nin fact , the results of our study were different than expected with regard to atrial fibrillation compared to other researchers [ 4 , 6 , 16 ] .\nadditionally , asimakopoulos et al . also found that the prevalence of atrial fibrillation was not significantly reduced ( 20% ) in comparison to the conventional technique ( 26% ) .\nanother issue is that humans have increasingly longer life spans , which may result in higher numbers of reoperations .\nellman et al . found that patent coronary grafts were the most commonly injured structures during reoperation ( 46% ) .\nwe routinely cover the aorta and proximal anastomoses of grafts with thymic fat tissue and the anterior wall of the pericardial cavity .\nwe also place an anterior mediastinal tube over the thymic fat tissue before closing the sternum in all patients . behind the heart ,\nadhesions between the inferior surface of the heart and the diaphragm can cause difficulties when dissecting the tissue layers during reoperation .\nmulay et al . demonstrated that pp provides an effective drainage pathway from the left pleural cavity , thereby reducing the prevalence of pericardial effusion .\nfor this reason , pp may be advantageous for reoperated patients in terms of reducing adhesions related to pericardial effusion .\nechocardiography can be useful in confirming and identifying the presence of pericardial effusion , hematoma , and tamponade . according to the results of our study , it is important to diagnose pericardial effusion at an early stage .\nhemodynamic deterioration due to pericardial fluid can be divided into four stages : pericardial fluid , hemodynamic tamponade , echocardiographic tamponade , clinical tamponade .\nechocardiographic follow - up of patients with pericardial effusion might be a factor extending the duration of hospital stay .\nwe recommend the pp technique and routine echocardiographic monitoring during the postoperative period in patients undergoing cas .\nthere is not sufficient research regarding the effects of pp on long - term results .\nthe present study also demonstrated that patients undergoing pp required a significantly shorter hospital stay and experienced lower rates of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade than the other groups .\nthis research was carried out on a small set of patients ( n = 96 ) ; therefore , there was an imbalance between men and women enrolled in this trial .\ngroup ii had a 2-fold elevation in the number of patients going into af postoperatively .\nin conclusion , pp may be a useful technique in the prevention of pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade after cas because it is simple , safe , and effective .\n. \n oral presentation at the 22 \n annual meeting of the asian society for cardiovascular and thoracic surgery that will be held in istanbul on april 3 -

{"id": 67, "text": "cancer places a huge burden on society and has been identified as the leading cause of death in both more and less economically developed countries .\nprojections based on the globocan 2012 estimates predict a substantive increase to 19.3 million new cancer cases per year by 2025 , due to growth and ageing of the global population .\nsouth africa , like other developing countries , is also experiencing an increase in the overall burden of disease attributable to cancer , with the number of new cancer cases predicted to increase by 46% by 2030 .\nthis is likely to result in an increase in the use of cancer chemotherapy agents , which assist in preventing the proliferation , invasion , and metastases of the cancer cells .\nthe basis for chemotherapy is anticancer drugs containing platinum , that is , cisplatin ( cis - diamminedichloroplatinum ii ) and carboplatin ( cis - diammine 1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylatoplatinum ii ) .\nother chemotherapy drugs include nitrogen mustard , amino - nicotinamide , dichloromethotrexate , bleomycin , and 5-fluorouracil [ 5 , 6 ] .\nthe first of these drugs , that is , cisplatin , consists of a divalent pt ( ii ) central atom and four ligands of cis - positioned pairs of chlorine atoms or amine groups .\nsince its discovery in the 1970s , cisplatin continues to be hailed as one of the most potent cancer chemotherapeutics in children and adults , as it is unique and unmatched in its effectiveness against many cancers , namely , osteogenic sarcoma , medulloblastoma , testicular , cervical , and ovarian cancers .\nsimilarly , its toxicity profile is expansive , involving the gastrointestinal , hematologic , renal , and auditory systems .\nwhile the use of saline hydration and mannitol diuresis may prevent nephrotoxicity , neurotoxicity is still not curable or preventable .\nototoxicity refers to the hearing disorder that results from the temporary or permanent inner ear dysfunction after treatment with an ototoxic drug .\nother drug classes known to have ototoxic properties include aminoglycosides , loop diuretics , quinine , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , and antiretroviral therapy ( art ) .\nthis is of concern in south africa , as it is estimated that 12.2% of the population ( 6.4 million persons ) were hiv positive in 2012 , which is 1.2 million more people living with hiv than in 2008 ( 10.6% , or 5.2 million ) .\nresultantly , art exposure had almost doubled from 16.6% in 2008 to 31.2% in 2012 .\nnot only will many infected people be at risk for ototoxicity due to arts , but a large number will also be susceptible to hiv - related cancers , such as kaposi 's sarcoma , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma , and cervical cancer , as well as infectious diseases such as tuberculosis , conditions that often require pharmacological therapy with the adverse side effect of ototoxicity .\nit is possible that their treatments could consist of simultaneous use of more than one ototoxic drug , increasing the likelihood of ototoxicity .\nall health care professionals managing patients with cancer should therefore be knowledgeable about the ototoxic properties of cisplatin .\nhowever , malhotra   indicated that most oncologists in india do not make referrals for audiological evaluations of patients receiving cisplatin , while a study in south africa revealed that the effects of ototoxicity , the role of audiologists , and need for their expertise were not fully realized by the oncologists sampled .\nthis is further supported by evidence from the south african study of khoza - shangase and jina   which indicated that most general practitioners sampled also do not appear to carry out ototoxicity monitoring strategies , despite being aware of their own role within an ototoxicity monitoring programme .\nthis review therefore aims to serve as resource for health professionals to enhance their understanding of ototoxicity as well as their roles within an ototoxicity monitoring programme by providing an overview and description of this condition in patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving cisplatin chemotherapy .\nthe review identified peer - reviewed articles available from january 1975 to july 2015 on the topic of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity and ototoxicity monitoring and included english articles only .\nthe same researcher conducted the literature search and reviewed the abstracts and articles for inclusion in the study .\nstudies were identified using keyword and mesh term searches of electronic databases depicted in table 1 . a manual search of relevant authors and journals\nthe references cited by each publication , review , or book chapter were reviewed in order to locate additional potential publications . in order to be selected , the article had to present data on either cisplatin ototoxicity and/or ototoxicity monitoring in human participants , and no research designs were excluded . running these searches yielded a total of 2106 records , of which 1581 were excluded based on the title and/or abstract as well as duplication .\neighty - five relevant articles , comprising six national and 79 international articles , were selected .\na perusal of narrative reviews of other auditory pathologies was conducted in an attempt to determine areas of significance for an overview of cisplatin ototoxicity .\nthis resulted in the following eight areas being included : the mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity , clinical presentation , risk factors , incidence rates in adults and children , the effect on quality of life , ototoxicity monitoring , otoprotective strategies , and management of an ototoxic hearing loss .\none such mechanism , the antioxidant model , involves the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) within the cochlea and consequent reduction in antioxidant enzymes following exposure to cisplatin chemotherapy [ 1620 ] .\nanother mechanism of cisplatin ototoxicity involves the significant contribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 3 isoform ( nox3 ) to the generation of reactive oxygen species within the cochlea , when activated by cisplatin [ 17 , 21 ] , while a third mechanism relates to the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel ( trpv1 ) [ 2224 ] .\nthe molecular mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity therefore include the following:creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation ands - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  .with the cellular mechanisms of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity including damage to the outer hair cells , supporting cells , marginal cells of the stria vascularis , spiral ligament , and the spiral ganglion cells , it is evident that the structures of the inner ear are most susceptible to damage by cisplatin chemotherapy , with apoptotic degeneration of the hair cell in the organ of corti being most prominent .\nthe outer hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea are most affected [ 27 , 28 ] .\nthis leads to an initial elevation of high frequency audiometric thresholds , followed by a progressive loss into the lower frequencies with continued therapy [ 27 , 28 ] .\nknowledge of the different mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity is important for health care professionals as it will create an awareness of its complexity and the resulting clinical presentation . \ncreation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation and s - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  .\ncisplatin - associated ototoxicity usually manifests as irreversible , progressive , bilateral , high frequency sensorineural hearing loss   with tinnitus .\nthe latter may occur with or without a hearing loss   and may be permanent or transient , sometimes disappearing a few hours after treatment   or alternatively persisting a week after treatment . while most of the hearing loss is permanent , there is sometimes sporadic and partial recovery . in addition ,\nrare cases of unilateral hearing loss have been reported , which are usually explained by tumour location and surgical or therapeutic intervention on the affected side . moreover\n, the hearing loss is not always symmetrical [ 33 , 34 ] , with jenkins et al .   finding that 75% of women on cisplatin chemotherapy displayed an asymmetry of hearing thresholds of at least 10  db between ears posttreatment .\nschmidt et al . , in their investigation of 55 children on cisplatin chemotherapy , found that the high frequency hearing thresholds were slightly elevated in the left ear and that males had a greater degree of hearing loss than the females .\nthe degree of hearing loss is often variable and is related to the dose ; that is , the higher the cumulative dose , the greater the ototoxic effect [ 35 , 36 ] .\nthe duration , number of cycles administered , and method of administration   also influence cisplatin - associated ototoxicity .\nadditional factors that may increase ototoxicity include exposure to concomitant noise , chemicals , and other ototoxic medications .\nfurthermore , evidence also shows that melanin content is related to an increased risk of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity .\nindividuals with dark eyes and therefore a higher melanin content in the cochlear are at greater risk of ototoxic damage , as the melanin causes retention of the platinum within the cochlear and subsequently increases the risk of damage [ 41 , 42 ] .\nindividuals presenting with renal insufficiency , that is , high levels of serum creatinine , are at a greater risk for cisplatin - associated ototoxicity . genetic risk factors , such as megalin and glutathione s - transferases gene polymorphism , have also been reported to influence cisplatin ototoxicity , as do physiological factors such as age , with younger children   and older adults ( older than 46 years )   presenting with a greater severity of hearing damage .\nawareness of these risk factors may assist health care professionals with informational counselling of the patient receiving cisplatin chemotherapy .\nthe incidence of cisplatin ototoxicity is variable in adults ( table 2 ) and children ( table 3 ) .\nthe variations may be due to a number of factors , such as differences in the dose , both within a cycle and the total amount administered over multiple cycles , time interval between courses , method of administration , and treatment duration , as well as differences in patient population .\nototoxicity poses a major problem to the cancer patient , as the quality of life after receiving cisplatin chemotherapy may be negatively affected due to hearing loss , resulting in social , emotional , and vocational difficulties , as effective communication is often hindered .\ntasks that normal hearing persons take for granted may become challenging and frustrating . in addition , an individual 's safety may be compromised due to the hearing loss , as appropriate response to alarms and warning signals may be delayed .\nfurthermore , a hearing loss may also result in psychosocial and physical health problems , as well as depression and social isolation .\nhence , hearing loss , often referred to as the  invisible condition ,  has serious visible ramifications on the quality of life of a hearing impaired individual .\nthis is particularly relevant if the individual has already experienced the hearing world , as the hearing function is never restored to normal , even though patients may benefit from the use of assistive listening devices , such as hearing aids and cochlear implants .\nthe impact of an ototoxic hearing loss may be more profound for infants and young children who are at a critical stage of their speech and language development .\nfurthermore , the high frequency nature of an ototoxic hearing loss may result in speech recognition and comprehension being compromised , resulting in possible neurocognitive and psychosocial delays .\nthere is also an elevated risk for academic learning problems and psychosocial difficulties in school - aged children and adolescents .\nliterature indicated that childhood survivors of neuroblastoma had twice the rate of difficulties , as indicated by parent reports , with reading and math skills , and/or attention and a higher risk of a general learning disability than those without a hearing loss .\nthere was also poorer self - reported quality of life scores in these children with regard to school functioning .\nhence , cisplatin - associated ototoxicity further complicates the morbidity of cancer patients , as it would also isolate them from family members and significant others at a time when they require the greatest support .\nadvancements in medical knowledge and technology , such as screening and early detection of several cancers , have resulted in notable improvements in relative five - year survival rates for cancer [ 64 , 65 ] .\ntherefore , improving the quality of life after cisplatin - based chemotherapy becomes increasingly important , and resulting comorbidities such as ototoxicity can be managed appropriately and immediately   if adequate monitoring is in place .\nthe nature of ototoxicity is such that it often goes undetected until speech intelligibility is affected   and is usually detected when a communication problem becomes evident .\ncommunication problems , such as constantly asking for repetition or not responding when spoken to , signify that the hearing loss has progressed to the frequencies important for understanding speech . in this case ,\nan audiological monitoring programme can avert , to a large extent , the reduced quality of life as a result of hearing loss , as patients on cisplatin chemotherapy can be identified early , counselled , monitored , and managed appropriately through interventions in a logical , systematic , and coherent manner .\naudiological monitoring should aim to identify the hearing loss early and reduce its impact on the individual 's life by means of proper medical and hearing intervention .\nprospective audiological evaluations remain the only reliable method for detecting ototoxicity before it becomes symptomatic .\nan ototoxicity monitoring programme should involve a health care team comprising of an oncology nurse , oncologists , audiologist , and pharmacist to ensure effective sustainability of such a programme , if implemented , with the patient being the central focus .\nthe audiologist is involved in identifying an ototoxic hearing loss , informing the oncologist of such a development , counselling the patient and their family , and prescribing amplification devices , such as hearing aids and cochlear implants .\nearly identification of an ototoxic hearing loss provides oncologists with an opportunity to adjust the chemotherapy regimen in order to reduce or prevent further deterioration of hearing . the oncologist and nurses should also counsel patients on the side effects of cisplatin , including ototoxicity , in an attempt to prepare them for treatment outcomes and help them set realistic expectations .\npharmacists who have access to a patient 's medication list may also alert the oncologists and audiologists to those who are on other ototoxic medication and therefore at a greater risk for cisplatin - induced ototoxicity .\neffective management of such patients using evidence - based practices may improve management of those with cancer , ensuring that they and their families are counselled and appropriate interventions are timeously implemented .\nthe principles of early identification and early intervention are a part of ototoxicity monitoring , and the audiologist can manage such a programme . in countries without ototoxicity management guidelines , the  guidelines for the audiological management of individuals receiving cochleotoxic drug therapy  developed by the american association of speech - language - hearing association   may , consequently , guide the audiologist in the implementation of an ototoxicity monitoring programme within a local , regional , or national setting . for widespread acceptance and use ,\nototoxicity monitoring programmes need to incorporate efficient and cost - effective ototoxicity identification techniques , while considering the health care system and demographics of the patient population being managed .\nfor any population receiving ototoxic medication , the following should be considered :  ( 1 ) the patient 's level of alertness or ability to respond reliably ; ( 2 ) the most appropriate times during the treatment protocol for test administration , and ; ( 3 ) the test should comprise the baseline , monitoring and post - treatment evaluations  .\nappropriate time intervals for audiological assessments may differ depending on the type of cancer as well as the frequency and dose of cisplatin ( figure 2 ) .\nthe audiological assessments should incorporate a detailed case history , otoscopic examination , immittance audiometry , speech audiometry , dpoaes , and conventional and extended high frequency audiometry ( i.e. , up to 20  000  hz ) ( hfa ) [ 69 , 73 ] . these procedures are all conducted for the baseline assessment and the six - month follow - up evaluation [ 69 , 73 ] . while auditory brainstem response may be used , it is not considered a standard procedure for monitoring ototoxicity . monitoring audiological evaluations during treatment and the one- and three - month follow - up evaluations include case interview , otoscopy , and immittance audiometry as well as air conduction pure tone and objective testing . however , full - frequency threshold testing is impractical for many patients on cisplatin chemotherapy , as these individuals are often extremely ill and easily fatigued . the use of abbreviated threshold monitoring procedures that are clinically practical for these patients is therefore recommended .\none such method involves the use of the sensitive range for ototoxicity ( sro ) .\nthis is  the highest frequency with a threshold at or below 100  db spl followed by the next six lower adjacent frequencies in 1/6-octave steps or the one octave range near the highest audible frequency  .\nsro is usually determined during the baseline evaluation and is dependent on each patient 's hearing threshold configuration . during monitoring evaluations\nhowever , full - frequency testing should be conducted within the same session if an asha significant hearing change is noted within the sro .\nif a patient on cisplatin chemotherapy is still responsive and alert , the protocol presented above would be suitable .\nhowever , a patient who has limited responsiveness may be required to undergo the same audiological evaluations , except speech audiometry .\npatients who are responsive as well as those who have limited responses can undergo both behavioural and objective testing . however , those patients who are too ill or too young to respond should undergo only objective testing , such as otoscopy , tympanometry , acoustic reflexes , and dpoaes or abrs . while pure tone audiometry in the conventional frequency range is suitable for evaluating hearing in the range responsible for speech understanding , as well as for differential diagnosis , it is less sensitive to detecting early ototoxic change [ 11 , 70 ] .\nthe two tests identified as being the most important for the early detection of cisplatin ototoxicity are hfas and oaes , each also having limitations ( see table 4 )\n. therefore , using each test in isolation may not be as effective as utilizing a test battery approach , as it increases the chances of obtaining reliable audiologic monitoring data over time .\nin addition , these two tests could be used to complement one another in every cycle of chemotherapy to ensure the earliest detection of ototoxicity . the ototoxicity monitoring protocol proposed by\nasha   represents an aggressive and ideal approach for monitoring ototoxicity and is dependent on a country 's infrastructure and resource constraints .\nthe asha   guidelines may therefore not be generalized to a country without considering the contextual factors that may influence its applicability to that country .\nhowever , it does provide guidance towards creating a roadmap that countries , such as south africa , may aspire towards in implementing an ototoxicity monitoring programme .\nsimilar to india , no programmes have been formally implemented to identify and monitor ototoxicity in patients on cancer chemotherapy in south africa . as a result , there is no contextually relevant research to steer the implementation of an accountable and effective ototoxicity monitoring program in the country .\nthis is probably one of the main reasons for ototoxicity monitoring programmes not being commonplace in local hospitals and clinics .\nin addition , the health of south africans is characterized by a quadruple burden of disease , encompassing the occurrence of infectious diseases , the rise of noncommunicable diseases , and perinatal and maternal disorders , as well as injuries and violence , which may result in cancer receiving low priority for health care services . however\n, the creation of an audiological monitoring programme allows for better control of cancer related comorbidities . over the years\n, a number of studies have investigated the use of otoprotectants with cisplatin , their purpose being to protect the inner ear from any injury while not interfering with the antitumor effects of cisplatin .\notoprotective strategies include reducing the formation of free radicals by maintaining glutathione levels and antioxidant activity .\nthree mechanisms may provide protection against cisplatin , these being endogenous molecules , exogenous agents , or a combination of exogenous agents that trigger endogenous protective mechanisms .\nhowever , endogenous agents are not effective against cisplatin when the dose exceeds a certain threshold [ 17 , 81 ] .\nnearly all of the otoprotective agents are sulfur- or sulfhydryl - containing compounds ( thio compounds ) , known as antioxidants , and potent heavy metal chelators .\nthe numerous otoprotective agents utilized in clinical and animal studies include amifostine , d - or l - methionine , methylthiobenzoic acid , lipoic acid , tiopronin , glutathione ester , sodium thiosulfate , melatonin , vitamin e , n - acetylcysteine , dexamethasone , and resveratrol . however\n, none of these agents have been found to be unequivocally beneficial in preventing cisplatin ototoxicity and no agent is currently recommended for routine use . further research is therefore needed to find new methods and optimize old ones to prevent and/or treat hearing loss during cisplatin therapy .\nin addition , intratympanic administration of medication together with gene therapy needs to be further explored .\nintratympanic administration involves the diffusion of the otoprotective agent across the round window into the inner ear , where its therapeutic effect is exerted .\nan advantage of this method of administration is that there are higher concentrations of the otoprotective agent in the inner ear , this being in comparison to the use of oral or parenteral administration , without potentially reducing the efficacy of the cisplatin treatment [ 89 , 90 ] .\nthe disadvantage of this procedure , however , is that each ear would have to be treated with a moderately invasive procedure . alternatively\n, gene therapy may prove to be beneficial in protecting an individual against cisplatin - induced hearing loss as several genes , namely , megalin , glutathione - s - transferases , thiopurine s - methyltransferase , and catechol - o - methyl transferase , may be responsible for susceptibility to hearing loss .\nif a cisplatin - associated hearing loss results in communication difficulties , it is the audiologist 's ethical responsibility to begin or recommend aural rehabilitation .\nhowever , this intervention should not only occur once hearing loss has been detected but before the patient begins the cisplatin chemotherapy .\naural rehabilitation techniques such as speech reading and counselling on compensatory communication strategies should be conducted .\nthe counselling should include spouses and significant other , as hearing loss may not only impact the person with cancer but also frequent communication partners .\npatients with sensorineural hearing loss due to the use of cisplatin may also benefit from the use of assistive listening devices such as hearing aids or cochlear implants .\nchildren with ototoxic hearing loss may also require the use of personal frequency modulated systems in the classroom .\nfurthermore , with the recent developments in hearing aid technology , a patient with an ototoxic hearing loss is more likely to receive the desired amplification benefit .\nthese hearing aids are able to amplify sounds at and above 8000  hz . however , there is limited data indicating significant improvements in speech recognition with the use of this technology .hearing aids with frequency lowering technology achieved by linear frequency transposition , nonlinear frequency compression , or spectral envelope warping .\nfrequency lowering is used to overcome the limits of either the bandwidth of the device or the functional bandwidth of the ear , by lowering high frequency energy to a region that is more likely to provide and/or benefit from audible sound .\nwhile there are no published studies suggesting one approach to be superior to another , frequency lowering technology has been found to improve audibility and speech understanding of high frequency sounds .\ncommercially available types of frequency lowering signal processing include frequency transposition ( widex ) , nonlinear frequency compression ( phonak ) , and frequency translation ( starkey ) .\nthese processors are commercially labelled as audibility extender , soundrecover , and spectral iq , respectively . \nthese hearing aids are able to amplify sounds at and above 8000  hz . however , there is limited data indicating significant improvements in speech recognition with the use of this technology .\nhearing aids with frequency lowering technology achieved by linear frequency transposition , nonlinear frequency compression , or spectral envelope warping .\nfrequency lowering is used to overcome the limits of either the bandwidth of the device or the functional bandwidth of the ear , by lowering high frequency energy to a region that is more likely to provide and/or benefit from audible sound .\nwhile there are no published studies suggesting one approach to be superior to another , frequency lowering technology has been found to improve audibility and speech understanding of high frequency sounds .\ncommercially available types of frequency lowering signal processing include frequency transposition ( widex ) , nonlinear frequency compression ( phonak ) , and frequency translation ( starkey ) .\nthese processors are commercially labelled as audibility extender , soundrecover , and spectral iq , respectively .\nthis review has highlighted that cisplatin ototoxicity is a frequent adverse event of cisplatin chemotherapy that may negatively affect the quality of life of patients with cancer .\nthe different molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in cisplatin - associated ototoxicity highlight the complexity of this condition and the consequent difficulty in identifying an effective otoprotective agent .\nthe varying incidence rates reported in both adults and paediatrics may be due to the different audiological tests employed in the monitoring of the cancer patient 's hearing status and therefore highlight the importance of the use of extended high frequency audiometry and dpoaes in ototoxicity monitoring .\nan audiological monitoring programme comprising a team of health care professionals , knowledgeable about cisplatin ototoxicity , may therefore serve to improve evidence -

{"id": 68, "text": "the synthetic modification \n of proteins enables the construction \n of biomolecular hybrids that can be used to study protein function , deliver potent therapeutics to cellular targets , and build new materials .\nthe synthesis of these constructs requires a suite of chemoselective \n bioconjugation reactions that proceed under mild , aqueous conditions \n in the presence of the native functional groups that are present on \n protein surfaces .\nthe most common methods for protein modification \n target the nucleophilic side - chains of lysine and cysteine . however , these strategies can \n result in complex product mixtures , as lysine is typically found in \n high abundance on the protein surface and \n uniquely reactive cysteine labeling sites can be difficult to install \n in many instances ( such as thiol proteases and proteins produced via \n the eukaryotic secretory pathway , for example ) . many newer approaches \n for the site - selective modification of proteins \n involve the introduction of artificial amino acids with reactivities \n that are orthogonal to those of the native \n amino acids . along these lines ,\na number of powerful methods have \n been developed for the selective modification of azide , alkyne , alkene , carbonyl , and aniline moieties .\nhowever , the difficulty \n of introducing a non - canonical amino acid can limit the application \n of these methods .\ncomplementary approaches rely on the site - selective \n modification of native amino acids by enzymes .\nin addition , a reliable method for the modification of c - terminal \n thioesters with n - terminal cysteines , termed  native chemical \n ligation  , has been developed by kent and co - workers .\nthis method has been used for the semi- and total synthesis of complex \n protein substrates , including the chemical synthesis of a single glycoform \n of human erythropoietin . as an alternative \n strategy ,\nwe and others have developed methods \n for the selective modification of the n - terminal amino group .\nmethods that target the n - terminus can offer significant advantages \n for bioconjugate preparation , as they can be used for a wide range \n of protein targets produced by virtually any expression system . conceptually \n powerful as they are , however , these methods can be hampered by long \n reaction times , often require large excesses of reagent , and/or involve \n at least two - steps for the attachment of synthetic molecules .\nwe have \n therefore sought to develop new techniques that can achieve n - terminal \n modification with similarly high positional selectivity , but with \n significantly improved efficiency .\nherein , we report an oxidative \n coupling pathway that can preferentially \n modify the n - terminus of proteins with fast kinetics .\npeptide substrates \n were first used to screen reaction conditions and identify the site \n of modification . a peptide panel with varying n - terminal residues \n\nwas then evaluated to determine the sequence specificity of the reaction , \n leading to the identification of proline as the optimal n - terminal \n amino acid .\nthe reaction was next applied to protein substrates , showing \n similarly high levels of conversion when an n - terminal proline residue \n was present .\nthis mild bioconjugation reaction enables the facile , \n rapid modification of proteins to create a well - defined and stable \n linkage in a single position , and thus should be useful for many different \n applications in chemical biology and the construction of biomolecular \n materials .\nwe have previously reported \n the chemoselective coupling of aniline \n moieties on proteins to electron - rich aromatic rings , such as o - aminophenols , at slightly acidic ph ( 6.06.5 ) .\nthese reactions require the addition of naio4 or k3fe(cn)6 as a terminal oxidant , with the latter \n reagent exhibiting improved compatibility with glycoproteins and substrates \n with free sulfhydryl groups . the use of ferricyanide as the oxidant \n also yields a single reaction product ( 1 ) , whereas periodate \n leads to the formation of a ring contracted species as a competing \n pathway .\nthe ferricyanide - based reactions \n are presumed to involve an o - iminoquinone as the \n reactive intermediate , as suggested in scheme 1 , or could involve the corresponding o - quinone after \n imine hydrolysis . taken together , the oxidative coupling strategies \n have demonstrated excellent functional group compatibility and the \n ability to join large unprotected biomolecules at low concentrations , \n as demonstrated for the coupling of peptides , polymers , and nucleic \n acids to specific locations on viral capsids and antibody fc domains . while these coupling reactions \n were found to be highly aniline - selective \n under the conditions used , several studies have reported the reaction \n of o - aminophenols and o - catechols \n with native amino acids , dating back to 1949 .\nin addition , recent work by messersmith has shown the ability of \n proteins to be coupled to o - quinone moieties present \n on polydopamine - coated surfaces .\nthese reports \n suggested that secondary coupling pathways could be developed to achieve \n the modification of native amino acids with o - aminophenols \n ( scheme 1 ) , and thus initial experiments were \n designed to identify the optimal reaction conditions for achieving \n this with complex molecules . in our previous \n work\n, we noted that low amounts of background reactivity could be \n observed in aniline - based oxidative coupling reactions when higher \n ph conditions ( > ph 6.5 ) were used . in \n an initial effort to characterize this alternative reaction pathway , \n conditions and reaction times\nwere first screened to increase the \n reaction yields for peptides that did not contain aniline groups . \n\nangiotensin i and melittin were used as substrates , as they contain \n many reactive amino acids , including lys , arg , his , trp , and tyr . \n\nthe peptides were exposed to 2-amino - p - cresol using \n k3fe(cn)6 as the oxidant .\nthe reaction ph was \n varied from 5.5 to 8.5 , and the reaction mixtures were analyzed using \n maldi - tof ms ( supporting information figure \n s1 ) .\nthe level of modification increased with the basicity of the \n reaction , with near quantitative modification of angiotensin i after \n 20 min at ph 7.5 and higher . throughout these initial investigations , \n it was noted that angiotensin and melittin showed significant differences \n in reactivity , with angiotensin consistently demonstrating better \n conversion .\nms / ms analysis of the angiotensin product was used to \n identify the participating residue , and revealed that the n - terminal \n amino group was responsible for the observed reactivity ( supporting information figure s2 ) . as further \n confirmation of the site - selectivity ,\nseveral peptide substrates were \n screened for reactivity ( figure 1a and supporting information figure s3 ) .\nconsistent \n with the n - terminal reaction selectivity , the only peptide that did \n not react had a pyroglutamate in this position , and therefore no free \n amino group .\n( a ) \n modification of commercially available peptides was monitored by maldi - tof \n ms .\n( b ) a positional scan of the n - terminal amino acid was \n evaluated .\npeptides with the sequence xadswag were tested for reactivity with 2-amino - p - cresol .\nthe reactions were run with 100 m peptide , 200 m \n aminophenol , and 5 mm ferricyanide at ph 7.5 and analyzed by lc  ms . \n\nshown is the average percent modification with error bars representing \n the standard deviation of three reactions .\nthe same peptides were \n used for a screen of coupling partner equivalents ( c ) and a time screen \n ( d ) .\nmost buffers did not alter the reactivity , but \n imidazole and buffers containing a morpholine or piperazine ring ( pipes , \n hepes , hepps , and mops ) significantly impeded the reaction ( supporting information figure s4 ) .\nthis is possibly \n due to small amounts of buffer impurities that react competitively \n with the oxidized intermediate .\nthe time course of the reaction was \n also investigated ( supporting information figure s5 ) .\nin addition , it was found that the peptides could be modified \n using naio4 as the oxidant , or 4-methylcatechol as the \n coupling partner ( supporting information figures s67 ) . both of these reactions showed the same dependence \n on ph ; however , moderate levels of modification were still observed \n at acidic ph ( 5.56.5 ) when using these alternative coupling \n conditions .\nthese observations suggested that the peptides were reacting \n with the o - quinone intermediate formed in \n situ from either the catechol or the iminoquinone precursor \n ( after imine hydrolysis ) .\ngiven the differential \n reactivity observed on peptide substrates , we synthesized peptides \n with varied n - terminal residues ( xadswag ) to determine the specificity of the reaction .\nthe base sequence \n was selected to increase the mass of the peptide , impart water solubility , \n and include a tryptophan residue for quantitation using uv monitoring . \n\nthe peptides were synthesized on the solid phase using standard fmoc \n synthesis , cleaved from the resin , and purified by hplc .\nafter purification , \n the peptides were resuspended in phosphate buffer , ph 7.5 , adjusted \n to a concentration of 1 mm , and stored at 20 c until \n use .\nto assess the effect of the n - terminal residue on reactivity , \n the peptides ( 100 m ) were reacted with 2 equiv of 2-amino - p - cresol ( 200 m ) in the presence of k3fe(cn)6 ( 5 mm ) in phosphate buffer , ph 7.5 ( figure 1b ) .\nms ( see supporting information figure s8 for representative ms data \n for the modified peptides ) .\nmost n - terminal amino acids showed good - to - high \n levels of conversion ( 6090% ) , but proline stood out as the \n only residue that showed nearly complete modification ( 90100% ) . \n\na second observation of this screen was the fact that tryptophan , \n tyrosine , and methionine residues were not oxidized by the ferricyanide \n reagent , consistent with our previous report of oxidative coupling \n with this oxidant ( see supporting information figure s8 ) .\nhowever , free cysteine residues can be oxidized to various \n species , potentially including disulfides and sulfenic acids , and \n thus it is recommended that they be protected as disulfides before \n oxidative coupling is attempted ( vide infra ) .\nto optimize the reagent ratios ( specifically the equivalents of o - aminophenol ) , the peptides ( 100 m ) were reacted \n with 110 equiv of the o - aminophenol ( 1001000 \n m ) in the presence of ferricyanide ( 10 mm ) . after 30 min , the \n reactions were quenched with excess tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine \n ( tcep ) .\nit was demonstrated that conversion was highest using 25 \n equiv of the coupling partner ( figure 1c ) . \n using more than 5 equiv of\nthis was most likely due to the ability of \n the aminophenol to react with itself at higher concentrations ( 1 \n mm ) . consistent with this , when using 10 equiv of the o - aminophenol , a byproduct was observed with a mass that corresponded \n to the condensation of 3 aminophenols ( 344 da ) .\nwe also investigated \n the differences in coupling rates for representative \n n - termini .\nthe reaction of 2-amino - p - cresol with \n three different peptides was monitored over the course of 1 h ( figure 1d ) .\nthe peptides ( 100 m ) were reacted with \n 2 equiv of the o - aminophenol ( 200 m ) in the \n presence of ferricyanide ( 5 mm ) , and aliquots were quenched with excess \n tcep at the indicated time points .\nthe proline terminal peptide not \n only reached the highest level of conversion , but also did so in a \n significantly shorter time than the other termini . despite efforts \n to optimize conditions for all n - termini\nthe reaction of n - terminal \n amines with o - aminophenols \n was characterized using small molecule mimics .\nthe methyl esters of \n phenylalanine ( h - phe - ome ) and proline ( h - pro - ome ) were coupled to \n 2-amino - p - cresol using ferricyanide at ph 7.5 .\nthe \n crude products were characterized using two - dimensional nmr and high - resolution \n mass spectrometry .\nthe primary amine of h - phe - ome formed p - iminoquinone product 2 , which was analogous to the \n one formed with aniline coupling partners ( scheme 1 , supporting information figure \n s9 ) . however , the secondary amine of proline prevented the formation \n of the p - iminoquinone tautomer , and thus favored o - quinone product 3 ( scheme 1 , supporting information figure \n s10 ) .\ngiven the different linkage obtained with proline , we verified \n the stability of the product to a variety of conditions .\nthe proline \n terminal peptide , padswag , was first modified with 2-amino - p - cresol .\nafter purification , the modified peptide ( 100 \n m ) was exposed to reductants , nucleophiles and acidic and basic \n ph ( 10 mm additives or buffer ) .\nno loss of product was \n observed under any of the conditions tested , demonstrating the hydrolytic \n stability of the product ( supporting information figure s11 ) .\nthe ability of the linkage to withstand these conditions \n renders this method quite useful for the construction of biomolecular \n materials for a variety of applications . with a view toward in vivo applications ,\ncurrent efforts are examining the \n stability of the linkage in blood plasma , as well as evaluating the \n intrinsic immunogenicity of the o - quinone group . in the process of characterizing the reaction products ,\nit was observed \n that the colored products absorbed light at wavelengths greater than \n 500 nm ( with max between 505 and 525 nm depending \n on the amine coupling partner ) . as the starting coupling partners \n and ferricyanide did not absorb at these wavelengths , this unique \n absorbance provided a means to monitor the reaction progress . the \n different amine coupling partners ( p - toluidine , h - pro - ome , \n and h - phe - ome )\nwere reacted with 4-methylcatechol in the presence \n of 10 mm ferricyanide , and the absorbance of the resulting solution \n was monitored at 520 nm to determine the relative rates of reactivity \n ( figure 2a ; for unnormalized data see supporting information figure s12 ) .\nthe catechol \n substrate was used for these studies to simplify the reaction pathway \n by eliminating the imine hydrolysis step .\nthe reactions were run under \n pseudo - first order conditions with 0.1 mm catechol and 1 mm amine \n coupling partner . when the reaction was carried out at ph 6.0 ,\nthe \n reaction with the proline analogue reached completion nearly as rapidly \n ( 2 min ) , but the reaction with the primary aliphatic amine \n of phenylalanine required longer reaction times ( 10 min ) . \n\n( a ) amine coupling partners were reacted with 4-methylcatechol \n as a model substrate .\nreactions were run under pseudo - first \n order conditions with 100 m catechol , 1 mm amine , 10 mm ferricyanide \n in 50 mm phosphate buffer .\n( b ) a peptide containing both an n - terminal \n proline and a p - aminophenylalanine residue ( pad(paf)swag ) was tested for reactivity with 2 equiv of 2-amino - p - cresol at ph 6 .\nthe remainder of the reaction was purified \n and then reacted with 2 equiv of the aminophenol at ph 7.5 and analyzed \n by lc  ms . by quantifying product \n formation by absorbance\n, we were also able \n to measure the second - order rate constant for the proline - based coupling \n ( supporting information figure s13 ) .\nthe \n reaction of 1 equiv of h - pro - ome ( 100 m ) with 1 equiv of 4-methylcatechol \n ( 100 m ) and 100 equiv of k3fe(cn)6 ( 10 \n mm ) was performed in triplicate at 25 c .\nthe second - order rate \n constant for the coupling was determined to be 44  4 m s. while proline reacted rapidly with the electron - rich \n coupling partner , the small molecule studies indicated that aniline \n should react faster .\nthe rate for the aniline reaction was too fast \n under these conditions to determine the second - order rate constant \n accurately . given the differences in reactivity observed \n at ph 6.0 and 7.5 , \n we hypothesized that it would be possible to modify the aniline side \n chain of p - aminophenylalanine ( paf ) and the n - terminal proline amine sequentially . to test this hypothesis , \n we synthesized a peptide containing both reactive moieties ( pad(paf)swag ) .\nonly one modification was observed when the peptide \n was reacted with 2-amino - p - cresol at ph 6.0 ( figure 2b ) .\nms / ms analysis of the modified peptide confirmed \n that the single modification occurred on the aniline side chain ( supporting information figure s14 ) . after this \n step , the peptide was purified and subsequently reacted with 2-amino - p - cresol at ph 7.5 .\nreaction at the higher ph enabled a \n second modification of the peptide substrate , at the n - terminal proline \n residue .\nthe differential reactivity \n was investigated by comparing the reactivity of a protein containing \n a paf residue to proteins without the artificial \n amino acid .\nthe paf residue was introduced into the \n coat protein of bacteriophage ms2 , which self - assembles into a spherical , \n hollow protein shell .\nmyoglobin and a mutant of the tobacco mosaic \n virus ( tmv ) coat protein were used as native protein substrates .\nreactions \n with 2-amino - p - cresol were either performed on the \n isolated , individual proteins or with the aniline containing protein \n mixed with the native protein substrate ( supporting \n information figure s15 ) .\naddition of the aniline containing \n protein to the native protein decreased the n - terminal reactivity , \n indicating that the aniline residues react more rapidly than n - terminal \n residues with the o - aminophenols .\nin addition , ms2 \n showed significantly higher reactivity at all of the phs tested , confirming \n preference for aniline residues .\nthe oxidative coupling reaction \n with n - terminal amino groups was \n first tested on proteins with native n - termini .\nseveral proteins were \n reacted with o - aminophenol - functionalized 5 kda peg \n under the optimized reaction conditions ( figure 3 ) .\nthe native proteins showed moderate levels of reactivity , which \n could be attributed to inaccessible n - termini or simply to the less \n reactive n - terminal residues . to test\nif proline terminal proteins \n were more reactive , a proline residue was introduced to the n - terminus \n of gfp and the tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv ) coat protein .\nthe n - terminus \n of tmv was also slightly extended from the native sequence ( addition \n of pag ) .\nthe proline - gfp was treated with a variety of conditions \n to determine the specificity of the reaction ( figure 4a ) . only at basic ph in the presence of both the o - aminophenol substrate and\nthe oxidant was modification observed . \n additionally , the proline - terminal variant showed significantly improved \n reactivity compared to that of the wild - type n - terminus .\nthese high \n levels of modification were maintained even when only 12 equiv \n of the o - aminophenol peg was used .\nthe site of modification \n was confirmed to be the n - terminal proline by lc \nms / ms analysis \n of a tryptic digest of proline - gfp modified with 2-amino - p - cresol ( supporting information figure \n s16 ) .\n( a ) \n the n - terminus of several proteins was pegylated using o - aminophenol - functionalized 5 kda peg and ferricyanide .\n( b ) modification \n of wild type proteins with 5 kda o - aminophenol - peg \n was monitored by sds - page .\n( a ) a proline \n was introduced to the n - terminus of gfp .\nthe proline terminal \n variant showed much higher levels of modification than the wild - type \n protein .\nthe band doubling is due to a gel artifact , and appears in all \n lanes .\n( b ) mutants of tmv were reacted with 5 equiv of 2-amino - p - cresol and 1 mm k3fe(cn)6 for 30 min and analyzed by lc  ms .\nreaction conditions for both native and proline terminal \n proteins \n were optimized by evaluating reactivity with myoglobin and proline - gfp . \n\nthe reaction time , buffer , and ph were screened ( supporting information figures s17 and s18 ) .\nsimilar to the \n results obtained with peptide substrates , the reaction reached its \n highest level of conversion after about 1530 min .\nin addition , \n most buffer salts tested were compatible with the reaction with the \n exception of buffers containing morpholine ( mops ) or piperazine moieties \n ( hepes ) , as was observed with peptide substrates .\nthese buffers decreased \n the level of modification slightly , but did not completely inhibit \n reactivity .\nthe effect of reaction ph was tested using both k3fe(cn)6 and naio4 as the oxidants .\nlittle \n reactivity was observed at acidic ph , and the level of conversion \n increased between ph 7.0 and 8.0 . at higher reaction ph ( 8.0 ) \n\na second modification was observed , indicating that lysines may also \n participate in the reaction .\nhowever , it is also possible that under \n more forcing conditions , such as higher reaction ph or increased concentration \n of aminophenol substrate , the aminophenol reacts with both itself \n and the n - terminal amino group resulting in double modification of \n the n - terminus .\nn - terminal mutants of tmv were also evaluated \n for their reactivity \n with o - aminophenols .\nthe tmv monomers assemble into \n well - known double disk structures , displaying 34 copies of the n - terminal \n groups on their peripheries .\ntwo n - terminal \n mutants ( pag and ag ) were reacted with 5 equiv of 2-amino - p - cresol ( 100 m ) and 1 mm k3fe(cn)6 for 30 min .\nms demonstrated that the \n proline terminal mutant reached nearly complete conversion , while \n the alanine terminal mutant showed low levels of modification under \n these coupling conditions ( figure 4b , see supporting information figure s19 for wider mass \n range and ion series ) .\nthe compatibility of the reaction with \n cysteine residues was also \n tested using tmv . a single cysteine residue ( s123c )\nwas introduced \n into the tmv coat protein with a proline n - terminus ( pag s123c tmv ) . \n\nthis mutant was reacted with 2-amino - p - cresol and \n analyzed by lc \nthe cysteine residue also reacted with the o - aminophenol , resulting in two modifications .\nhowever , it was found that the n - terminal proline could be modified \n selectively if the cysteine was first capped ( figure 5a , b , see supporting information figures s2122 for wider mass range and ion series ) . to do \n this ,\nthe cysteine residue was protected as a disulfide bond by reaction \n with 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid ) ( dtnb , ellman s \n reagent ) .\nafter the oxidative coupling step the disulfide bond was \n readily reduced by tcep , leaving the free cysteine and the modified \n n - terminus .\nalternatively , the cysteine residue was modified with \n a maleimide , followed by modification at the n - terminus with an o - aminophenol reagent .\na ) pag s123c tmv was reacted with small molecule substrates and analyzed \n by lc \ncysteine residues were protected as a disulfide using \n ellman s reagent ( dtnb ) before oxidative coupling .\nsubsequent \n reduction of the disulfide resulted in selective modification of the \n n - terminus .\nthe n - terminal \n proline was then modified with a rhodamine - functionalized o - aminophenol .\nthis strategy allowed for the direct , dual modification of \n the \n protein at both the cysteine residue and the n - terminus .\ntwo fluorophores \n paired for frster resonance energy transfer ( fret , alexa fluor \n 488 c5-maleimide and o - aminophenol functionalized \n rhodamine b ) were thus conjugated to tmv using this strategy to create \n a templated array of chromophores for light harvesting applications .\nthe free cysteine was first quantitatively labeled with an alexa \n fluor maleimide ( supporting information figure s22 ) .\nthe n - terminal proline was then coupled to a fluorescent o - aminophenol resulting in 50% modification of the \n tmv monomers with both fluorphores ( figure 5b ) .\ncomplete modification of the n - terminus was not observed as tmv \n precipitated from solution with increasing levels of modification \n with the rhodamine dye . in current experiments\n, we are using this \n dual - labeling strategy to introduce more soluble chromophores .\nthe oxidative coupling \n reaction was also compared to the reaction \n of protein amines with activated esters .\nthis acylation methodology \n is commonly employed , and can be targeted to the n - terminus by controlling \n the reaction ph in some cases .\nthe reactions \n were compared on creatine kinase , a protein with a native proline \n n - terminus .\nreaction with 15 equiv of o - aminophenol \n peg resulted in good levels of modification of creatine kinase ( 5060% ) , \n while reaction with 15 equiv of n - hydroxysuccinimide \n ( nhs ) peg resulted in low levels of modification ( 525% , figure 6 ) .\nonly when a vast excess of the nhs peg was used \n were moderate levels of modification achieved . as was the case with \n proline - gfp ,\nsome over modification was observed under the oxidative \n coupling conditions when using five or more equivalents of aminophenol . \n\nthis could result from dimerization of the oxidized species before \n protein coupling , but has yet to be characterized due to the low abundance \n of this product . in any case , lowering the reaction ph slightly or \n using fewer equivalents of the o - aminophenol substrate \n prevented the over modification from occurring .\nthe modification of the \n n - terminus of creatine kinase with aminophenol \n peg was compared to the reaction of creatine kinase with nhs peg . \n\nin this study , we have identified conditions \n for the oxidative \n coupling of o - aminophenols to n - terminal amino acids . \n\nproline residues work particularly well with this strategy , and are \n therefore strongly recommended when using it .\nthese groups can be \n introduced readily in n -

{"id": 69, "text": "\n alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( aws ) is characterized by varied symptoms that range from mild to severe intensity depending on several factors including the quantity , frequency and duration of alcohol intake , and the number of prior withdrawal episodes , as well as individual differences in the vulnerability [ 14 ] .\nsymptoms usually present themselves within 6 to 24 hours after cessation of alcohol intake [ 5 , 6 ] .\nsubtyping of the aws has been attempted in the past , as gross   conceptualized and proposed 3 constellations of alcohol withdrawal symptoms : factor 1 hallucinogenic that consisted of nausea , tinnitus , visual disturbance , pruritus , parasthesia , muscle pain , agitation , sleep disturbance , tactile hallucinations , and hallucinations which are auditory or visual or both ; factor 2 affective and physiological that consisted of anxiety , depression , tremor , and sweats ; and factor 3 delirium that consisted of clouding of the sensorium , impairment of consciousness , and impairment of contact with the observer .\na cluster analytic study   identified three different symptoms clusters of alcohol withdrawal , namely , cns excitation , adrenergic hyperactivity , and delirium .\nseveral rating instruments have been used to measure severity of alcohol withdrawal . among them ,\nthe most commonly used observer - rated scale is the 10-item clinical institute withdrawal assessment - alcohol , revised ( ciwa - ar ) .\nit has been proposed that alcohol withdrawal symptoms in ciwa - ar appear multidimensional . a pubmed search supplemented with\nthe study by pittman et al .   was to explore the relationship between awsc and ciwa - ar , for which they carried out study on 127 male inpatients of alcohol dependence with principle components factor extraction with varimax rotation of ciwa - ar , a self - rated  alcohol withdrawal symptoms checklist ( awsc ) and on combined items of ciwa - ar and awsc .\nthey found three , five , and seven factor solution , respectively , for ciwa - ar , awsc , and combination of ciwa - ar and awsc .\nthe analysis of ciwa - ar was done on 7 items as 3 items had zero variance . the first factor ( variance 23.9% ) was  tension / anxiety  which consisted of anxiety , agitation , and tactile disturbances . the second factor ( variance 22.9% ) was  autonomic arousal  which consisted of paroxysmal sweats , tremor , and headache or fullness in head , whereas the third factor ( variance 17.4% , eigenvalue less than 1 ) was  nausea and vomiting  which consisted of a single item , nausea , and vomiting . in our setup\n, we use ciwa - ar as part of the measure for the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms .\nit is generally observed that alcohol withdrawal symptoms fluctuate in presentation and severity across time .\nthe present study was carried out to explore the dimensionality of this scale in an attempt to identify a set of underlying factors that exist and can explain the interrelationships among various manifestations of acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms .\nthe knowledge of these underlying factors may enhance our understanding of aws and better prediction of complications thus management plans .\nthis was a cross - sectional hospital - based study , conducted at centre for addiction psychiatry , central institute of psychiatry , ranchi , india , a tertiary care referral centre during may 2005 to june 2006 .\nstudy sample included 201 , only male fulfilling icd-10 dcr ( world health organization )   for alcohol dependence with currently withdrawal state , aged between 18 and 60 years , admitted within 24 hours of abstinence and patient himself or his guardian consenting for the study .\ninformation on patient 's demographics , treatment history , past history , and family history was obtained from interviews with patients and accompanying person .\ndetailed physical and neurological examinations were done to exclude any comorbid general medical condition , comorbid other psychiatric disorder , and any other comorbid substance use disorders except caffeine and tobacco . \n\nthe sociodemographic data sheet included age , marital status , religion , community , education , and economic status . whereas clinical variables recorded were age of onset of drinking alcohol , duration of dependence , past history of detoxification , number of previous detoxification , past history of withdrawal seizure , past history of delirium tremens , family history of alcohol or substance dependence , degree of relationship if family history of alcohol or substance dependence is present , and family history of mental illness .  \n\nit is the most widely used and studied 10-item alcohol withdrawal monitoring scale , which excludes vital sign abnormalities .\nit was developed from the 18-item clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol and it has been studied across various geographic locations .\nit has a good reliability , validity , and it is considered as one of the most widely used alcohol withdrawal assessment scale for symptom - triggered therapy .\neach sign and symptom item of ciwa ar is evaluated on a 07 point likert scale except for one item  orientation and clouding of sensorium  , which is scored on a 04 point likert scale .\na score of 8 points or less indicates mild withdrawal and patients scoring less than 10 do not usually need additional medication for withdrawal .\npatients admitted with alcohol dependence syndrome with acute withdrawal were evaluated with ciwa - ar immediately after admission then every six hours , as a routine protocol of the ward .\ndetailed physical examination , mental status examination , and planned screening laboratory investigation were done to ensure conformity of study criteria .\nthe patients get admitted with varying lengths of abstinence , ranging from hours to days , so we initially took all the ratings of all the patients and arranged them as rating at first 6 hours of abstinence and at every six hours like at 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 52 , 58 , and 64 hours till ciwa - ar scoring reaches below 10 .\nthe averages of each rating of ciwa - ar scores were computed to see the severity of withdrawal symptoms across time span of abstinence .\nmany patients were admitted after overnight , 12 to 18 hours of abstinence , so we included the patients who were admitted with at least 24 hours of abstinence .\nmeanwhile management and medications were continued as per ward protocol and no adjustment for study purpose was done .\nthe standard detoxification protocol included thiamine supplementation , benzodiazepines either lorazepam or diazepam , and correction of fluids and electrolytes if any and other symptomatic treatment of associated conditions like dyspepsia or concurrent injury , wound , and infections .\nthe collected data on 201 patients was statistically analyzed , using statistical package for social sciences ( spss , inc . ,\nexploratory factor analysis ( maximum likelihood method ) was carried out to identify factor structure on all items of ciwa - ar for day three .\nkaiser - meyer - olkin measure of sample adequacy and bartlett 's test of sphericity were also done to assess appropriateness of conducting factor analysis .\ntwo criteria for retaining the number of components were considered : kaiser 's criterion   to retain eigenvalues greater than unity and cattell 's   scree plot inspection for the point of inflexion .\nthe mean age of the group was 37.18 ( sd 9.35 , range 1869 ) years .\nmost of them were married ( 83.3% ) , educated ( 90% ) , residing in urban background ( 64.7% ) , belonging to middle socioeconomic status ( 60.3% ) , and earning a livelihood ( 80.4% ) .\nthe mean age of starting alcohol was 21.63 ( sd 4.99 ) years , whereas mean duration of dependence on alcohol was 6.49 ( sd 5.06 ) years .\n22.5% had history of withdrawal seizures , in their course of alcoholism , and only 2% reported history of delirium tremens in the past .\nfamily history of substance dependence was present in 33.3% of the total sample , out of which alcohol dependence was present in 56.9% of subjects and cannabis dependence in 8.3% .\nthe item frequency and mean of all six hourly ciwa - ar ratings were calculated ; the mean scores of ciwa - ar at 24 hours and at 36 hours are shown in table 2 .\nthe mean ciwa - ar score at 24 hours was 13.32 ( sd 9.27 ) and 20.4 ( sd 9.09 ) at 36 hours .\nbased on the frequency variance and total ciwa - ar score we decided to carry out factor analysis with the 10 items of ciwa - ar as on scoring at 36 hours of abstinence .\nbartlett 's test of sphericity was significant ( 2 = 1.044 , df = 45 , p < .001 ) , indicating that a factor analysis is appropriate .\nfactor analysis ( extraction method - maximum likelihood ) with the 10 items of ciwa - ar for day three , resulted in initial three factors with eigenvalues greater than unity .\nthe scree plot was also showing clear inflexion , supporting three factors ( figure 1 ) .\ntherefore , three factors were retained , which captured 68.74% of variance . following varimax rotation with kaiser 's standardization ,\nthe factors and their item loadings , with absolute values greater than 0.1 , are shown in table 3 .\nnone of the items loaded on more than one factor . the first factor named as \ndelirious factor ,  which had highest loading from tactile disturbances ( .999 ) , followed by auditory disturbances , orientation and clouding of sensorium , and agitation .\nit explained 34.34% of variance and showed good internal consistency ( cronbach 's alpha = .91 ) . the second factor named as \nautonomic factor  reflected four - item loading , highest from anxiety , followed by paroxysmal sweats , tremor , and headache or fullness in head .\nit explained 24.25% of variance and showed moderate internal consistency ( cronbach 's alpha = .66 ) . the third factor named as \nnonspecific factor  reflected two - item loadings , nausea , and visual disturbances that explained 10.04% of variance and a cronbach 's alpha of .26 .\nwe examined the factor structure of the ciwa - ar in a population of adult men hospitalized to a tertiary psychiatric institute for treatment of alcohol dependence .\nthe ideal study of aws could have been the assessment before starting medication , but this was practically not possible for many reasons .\nfirstly , many of the patients come for admission after 12 to 18 hours of abstinence and severe withdrawal , so keeping them drug free was ethically not possible .\nthus natural aws presentation and its severity were masked by routine benzodiazepam administration and thiamine supplement .\nsecondly , many other patients were referred from primary care centers with initial management , including long acting benzodiazepines like diazepam that masks the aws .\nthirdly , many other patients came even before onset of withdrawal and in a state of intoxication ; the aws was not fully evolved in terms of range of symptoms and severity .\nfor all these reasons , the mean ciwa - ar score for the initial 24 hours of abstinence ( first day ) of admission was only 13.32 ( sd 9.27 ) .\nlater the sequential rating found more prominent withdrawal symptoms reaching highest mean score of 20.4 at thirty - six hours then gradually decreased .\nas drug free aws was not possible , we consider that the higher mean score of ciwa - ar represents the aws better than low score . also as both aws medications and alcohol itself are cns depressant and act in a similar way , either medication or alcohol intake should not make much difference in clinical picture .\nso we decided to proceed for factor analysis with highest mean ciwa - ar scoring at the 36th hour .\nthe severity of withdrawal symptoms and appearance of complete sets of withdrawal symptoms at the 36th hour may have been influenced by plasma half - life of benzodiazepams being used for detoxification . in this study ,\nchoice of medication was with treating team of the hospital ; however , only either intermediate acting lorazepam or long acting diazepam was used for this purpose .\nthere was no use of short acting benzodiazepines , which causes varying and rebound withdrawal symptoms across different time frame with its dosing and changing plasma concentration .\nanother more important influencing reason for varying withdrawal symptoms across different time frame could have been the dose of benzodiazepines , but we did not interfered with any medications or dosing and it was continued as per ward protocol to ensure naturalistic conditions . however , the equivalent benzodiazepines mean dose at 36 hour was 30  mg of diazepam per day .\nbut this equivalent dose may not be accurate as many patients were on oral medications and others were on parenteral benzodiazepines .\nwe excluded any other comorbid substance use disorders or polysubstance dependence but a few patients may also have undisclosed benzodiazepine or organic inhalant abuse or addiction .\nwe also excluded any comorbid general medical condition especially epilepsy for that reason , patients on antiepileptic either taking it regularly or skipping will modify the alcohol withdrawal symptoms . for\nthat matter any psychotropic drugs causing cns depression or any effecting stimulants will alter the withdrawal symptoms .\nmost of the patients needed proton pump inhibitor drugs like pantoprazole or omeprazole for the alcohol induced dyspepsia , peptic ulcer disease , or gastroesophageal reflux disease , but these medications do not impose any effect on alcohol withdrawal symptoms . in a previous study by pittman et al . , the mean ciwa - ar score for day one was 13.2 ( sd 3.7 ) which was similar to our study , 13.32 ( sd 9.27 ) at 24 hours ; they continued with analysis on data collected on the first study day to exclude medication effects .\nbut we analyzed the data as of 36 hours of abstinence , showing higher mean ciwa - ar score and all ten items had variance above 10% , thus representing fully developed withdrawal syndrome .\nhowever we could not control the medication effect used to control the withdrawal symptoms for ethical reasons , the used medications were benzodiazepine and thiamine supplementation for all the patients .\ntwo items of ciwa - ar , namely , auditory disturbances and tactile disturbances were very infrequent in our sample ( 9.5 and 10% ) on day one which increased to 55.1 and 65.7% at 36 hours , other items scoring raised on day two like agitation , orientation and clouding of sensorium , visual disturbances , and paroxysmal sweats ; few other items remained unchanged on day one and two like anxiety and tremor ; however scoring of only this item  headache or fullness in head  improved on day two from 28.9 to 12.9% ( table 2 ) .\nthis indicates the importance of time duration of abstinence to study the alcohol withdrawal symptoms .\nwe found a three - factor solution based on rotated eigenvalues and scree plot analysis .\nthe first factor explained 34.34% variance and consisted of four items , namely , tactile disturbances , auditory disturbances , orientation and clouding of sensorium , and agitation .\nthis factor appears to represent perceptual abnormality and delirium and may be considered as subclinical spectrum of delirium .\nhowever , the only other factor analytic study of ciwa - ar by pittman et al .   found these items ( except agitation ) were infrequent in their sample and were not included in analysis .\nthe difference may be due to the time span of withdrawal on which data was collected .\nstudy analyzed ciwa - ar for day one and also our data on day one showed very low variance for these items .\nthis suggests that ratings on alcohol withdrawal symptoms on the very first day may miss certain set of symptoms , which appears on and around day two and are characterized by perceptual abnormality and delirium like picture .\nfurther progression of alcohol withdrawal , we could not found beyond 36 hours , may be due to effects of continued medications for withdrawal suppression .\nsurprisingly , visual disturbances item did not have high loading on this factor , whereas tactile and auditory disturbances had maximum factor loading ( 0.999 and 0.873 , resp . ) .\nthe etiological basis for these two disturbances includes cns rebound excitation which alters the perceptual quality .\nfurthermore , some contribution of nutritional and specific vitamin deficiencies , such as thiamine and folate , and associated peripheral neuropathy probably add to these perceptual disturbances .\nthe other two items , orientation and clouding of sensorium and agitation with factor loadings of 0.851 and 0.777 , respectively , represent delirium .\nthe perceptual alteration and delirium being loaded in a single factor may have some predictive association and hence need to be studied for management plan .\nthe second  autonomic  factor explained 24.25% of variance and consisted of four items : anxiety , paroxysmal sweats , tremor , and headache and fullness in head with factor scores of .998 , .660 , .528 , and .245 respectively .\ncronbach 's alpha for this factor was 0.66 showing adequate internal consistency . within this factor\nthis factor may be a result of the practice of not using adrenergic medication on routine basis at our institute .\nall items ( paroxysmal sweats , tremor , and headache or fullness in head ) were loaded similarly .\nwe had additional anxiety to this factor ; hence , we share the name of this factor with pittman et al .   as  autonomic  .\nthe third  nonspecific  factor explained 10.04% of variance and consisted of two items : nausea and vomiting and visual disturbances , with low factor scores of .51 and .27 , respectively .\nthere are three proposed physiologic bases for the symptom manifestation of alcohol withdrawal symptoms : cns excitation , adrenergic hyperactivity , and delirium , which may be attributed to different neurotransmitters and they respond selectively to different pharmacotherapy\n. the cns excitation may be secondary to deficiency in gaba activity , whereas increase in cns epinephrine level causes adrenergic hyperactivity .\nthe nmda receptor hypersensitivity and overactivity of certain subtypes of nmda receptors are associated with delirium .\nthough we did not find a factor structure of aws in accordance with very strict pathophysiological manifestation of either autonomic , or cns excitation or psychological / affective , or perceptual / hallucinogenic in our sample , the obtained factors suggest existence of subgroups of patients with different set of symptoms .\nthis was expected as alcohol withdrawal manifests by simultaneous involvement of all mechanisms rather than any mutually exclusive mechanism .\nthis simultaneous involvement of several other neurotransmitters besides gaba and nmda , like noradrenaline , acetylcholine , and dopamine as well as hormones and electrolytes [ 17 , 18 ] will affect the symptom presentation .\nadditionally our data analysis had ciwa - ar ratings of day two ( 36 hours ) of admission with suppression of withdrawal symptoms from detoxification medications , that is , benzodiazepines .\nthis would have differential effect on withdrawal symptoms manifestation in terms of gaba suppression only and selective unopposed action on other neurotransmitters or lacking adrenergic activity . though avoiding pharmacological suppression or modification was not possible on ethical grounds to understand completely natural unmodified withdrawal manifestation .\nthere may also be possible influence of different types of alcoholic beverage and percent content of alcohol .\nstrength of our study includes large sample size and not interfering with any medications or management strategies thus providing setting of naturalistic conditions .\nthe use ciwa - ar is the most widely accepted alcohol withdrawal assessment scale and selection of abstinent hours was important to allow time for full appearance of symptoms , even though under cover of detoxification medication .\nthere was for better coverage and inclusion of withdrawal symptoms at 36 hours as indicated by total ciwa - ar score and item frequency .\nthese results have wider implications for the recognition and management of aws , particularly , for better understanding and identification of the symptom profiles for and differential management plans across subtypes of aws .\nthe use of adrenergic antagonists may have a valuable role in addition to benzodiazepines , in a set of patients with autonomic features .\none of the limitations in our study is that it includes male only patients ; however , gender can be an important issue in aws presentation and its severity .\neven studies found that sex hormone affects the aws by modulating the function of the gaba - a receptor .\nalso low levels of testosterone are associated with symptoms like indecision , excessive worrying , fatigability , and lassitude .\nanother limitation of this study is patients sample with severe aws requiring inpatient management , thus limiting generalizability of our findings across gender and to mild to moderate severity cases .\nanother limitation was that diagnosis was made clinically with icd-10 dcr criteria for  alcohol dependence with currently withdrawal state  , but not by a validated clinical interview .\nit is known that autonomic arousal is an important mechanism in aws ; thus , other physiological measures and biological markers for objective assessment may be included in future studies .\nfurther studies may also be carried out including cases of mild to moderate severity and in both sex to uncover the differences .\nalso , factor analysis depends heavily on the population studied ; therefore , studies on different population may be required to generalize our findings . for the clinical practice ,\nit is advisable not to overdepend on rating scales and it must not replace a thorough clinical evaluation of the patient 's medical status in prediction of those at risk of severe alcohol withdrawal .\nthe acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms was most severe at 36 hours of abstinence in our sample .\nthis study finds multidimensionality of alcohol withdrawal symptoms as measured with ciwa - ar ; we found three factors explaining 68.74 percentage of variance and named as delirious , autonomic and nonspecific ."}

the montelimar sugar farm is located 62 km from managua .\nhowever , the ineter humidity data are quite different from the relative humidity registered on the farm located in western managua .\ntemperature data were not available at ineter 's website . although only 22 subjects were followed - up for a short period of time in this study , important results were obtained .\nother authors have shown the relationship between heat stress health effects and the ability to perform different tasks , as well as the increased risk of suffering work - related injuries ( 14 ) . in this study , the workers drank more liquid as temperature values increased to maximum peaks .\nthis was part of a rehydration process which was well planned in advance by the company 's decision makers . unlike during past harvesting seasons , when water and rehydration solutions were distributed quite randomly , during this harvesting season cool water and specially formulated drinks were distributed or intended to be distributed to workers , who received 1 l just before they began their working day and then 500 ml every 30 minutes .\nthe basis of this principle is that drinking to satisfy thirst is not enough to keep a person well hydrated .\nmost of the people become aware of thirst once they have lost 12 l of body water and persons highly motivated to perform hard work may incur losses of 34 l before serious thirst forces them to stop and drink .\nsince dehydration reduces the capacity for absorption from the gut , workers must be educated regarding the importance of drinking enough water during work and continuing generous rehydration during off - duty hours ( 14 ) .\nthere was a significant increase of production , with up to 8 tons per worker during the follow - up period compared to the normal 5.5 tons per worker prior to the change in rehydration measures .\nthis important change in rehydration policies and increase in production output is the result of various efforts of training workers , foremen and managers on heat stress prevention , proper hydration measures and quality of ( working ) life carried out by occupational health and safety professionals ( physicians and engineers ) , human resources departments and top management at sugarcane farms .\n. often workers rejected the new rehydration measures , most of the time because it was difficult for them to understand thoroughly the dehydration and physiological compensatory mechanisms .\nsome of the reasons for this can be attributed to their low educational level , and feeling that  nothing bad has ever happened to me before , etc .\ncertainly more effort in terms of intervention strategies and scientific investigation needs to be carried out among workers in nicaragua who perform jobs in which they are exposed to high ambient temperatures .\nthese include farm workers , construction workers , miners and fishermen , especially those employed in the informal sector , which occupies about half of nicaragua 's economically active population .\nmore funds should also be designated by companies decision makers for improving basic working conditions , in order to increase overall productivity ( and workers satisfaction in terms of better wages ) .\nthis would also translate into safer and healthier workers , less absenteeism from sick leave , fewer accidents and other incidents .\nthe author has not received any funding or benefits from industry to conduct this study ."}

one is primary extraventricular cpts and the other is a result of a direct extension of fourth ventricular tumors through the foramen of luschka.15 because the tumor of our case revealed no connection from the fourth ventricle , it is considered to originate from small choroid tufts that normally project from each recess at the foramen luschka into the cpa or from ectopic choroidal islets  unconnected  with the choroid plexus.16 \n  the cpp of our case indicated dense calcification with ventricular enlargement .\nthe bulbous tufts extended from the fourth ventricular choroid plexus through the foramen of luschka have been known as the bochdalek flower basket , which could be identified in 75% on ct and 96% on mr imaging.17 calcification of the region was found in 38% on normal imaging anatomy.17 in pathological states , calcification of cpp was reported in 4.1% on plain skull radiographs and 23.8% on ct examinations in patients of all\n9 the feature of the calcification was commonly described as a stippled or patchy configuration that may include some degrees of hemorrhage.8 \n 9 \n 10 dense calcification was exceptionally reported by sarkar et al.2 the rate of hydrocephalus in association with cpp is 90% and the rate increases up to 100% in malignant cpps.8 the cause of hydrocephalus was considered a combination of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) overproduction ( four to five times that in healthy persons ) , obstruction of csf pathways by the tumor mass , impaired csf absorption , increased protein content of csf around the tumor , subarachnoid scarring or granulations related to recurrent bleeding from the tumor , elevated intraventricular pulse pressure , and adhesions around the exit foramina of the fourth ventricle caused by highly proteinaceous or hemorrhagic csf.2 \n 10 \n 18 the finding of tumor calcification in the cpa generally required consideration of differential diagnosis with papillary or psammomatous meningioma , melanotic schwannoma , and myxopapillary ependymoma . among these tumors ,\nassociation of ventricular enlargement with the finding of calcification might suggest the possible presence of cpts .\ngross total removal was performed in our case of atypical cpp , although the tumor adhered to adjacent structures . in the 2007 world health organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system\n, cpts are classified into cpp as grade i , atypical cpp as grade ii , and choroid plexus carcinoma ( cpc ) as grade iii . among cpts ,\ntotal removal of cpts is recommended and seems to be feasible since a significant prognostic factor was relevant to the extent of tumor removal , and no definitive evidence of the beneficial effect of radiotherapy has been reported6 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 . however , it is not always possible because of tumor bleeding and firm adhesion to adjacent structures , especially cranial nerves .\nthe rate of complete resection of benign cpp was 80% and the 5-year survival rate indicated is nearly 100% .\nthe majority of survivors are neurologically intact.19 because of the good prognosis , the preservation of cranial nerve functions should be primarily considered in surgery for benign cpp . as for the atypical cpp\n, the rate of total removal was decreased to 50 from 63%.11 \n 21 atypical cpp showed a recurrence rate of 29% , which was much higher than the 6% seen in cpp .\nin addition , seeding within the central nervous system , spontaneous pulmonary metastasis , or rapid regrowth of atypical cpp were also reported.7 \n 22 \n 23 total or gross total removal should be advocated , especially in malignant cpts even though the tumor encases the cranial nerves .\nthe finding of calcification in the cpa should suggest the possible presence of cpp , especially if ventricular enlargement is present ."}
{"id": 72, "text": "multipath signals occur in numerous microwave and rf applications when an unwanted portion of the original transmission propagates along any alternate path and ultimately couples to the receiver distorting the amplitude and phase of the desired signal [ 14 ] .\nif the amplitude of the multipath signal is sufficiently large , its impact can be considerable . in multistatic radar and communication systems ,\nthese types of interference are most often caused by reflections of either the main beam or side lobes with objects near or actually in the beam path .\nclassic examples include main beam propagation close to the earth 's surface with associated reflections off of the ground or water ( figure 1(a ) ) .\nvarious approaches can be used to filter or compensate for these reflections through time - gating   and signal time synchronization .\nthe potential for interference from multipath signals increases substantially in near - field applications ( figure 1(b ) ) , especially in situations where the receiving and transmitting hardware are integrated .\ncommercially available multichannel network analyzers ( e.g. , zvt8 by rohde & schwarz ; munich , germany ) utilize robust strategies to minimize these signal coupling problems .\nwe are developing multichannel transceiving arrays for medical microwave imaging which exploit near - field concepts to produce electrical property maps ( permittivity and conductivity ) of tissues of interest [ 8 , 9 ] and have addressed the issue by incorporating ( a ) dedicated mixers for each channel , ( b ) additional solid state switches for isolation , ( c ) double- and triple - braided coaxial cables , and ( d ) compartmentalized rf circuitry .\nthe implementation has proven effective for our application achieving channel / signal isolation greater than 130  db .\nan alternative data acquisition strategy integrates a commercial , 2-port network analyzer with an electronic switching network to feed an array of antennas [ 1012 ] which is effective but also has limitations because ( i ) dynamic range is constrained by the provisions of the network analyzer , ( ii ) two - way signal loss is incurred through the network , and ( iii ) the switching matrix has relatively poor cross - channel isolation .\nequally important in near - field imaging is the multiple paths a signal can take within the imaging zone .\nfigures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show a photograph of our clinical breast imaging tank and a schematic diagram of the antenna configuration , respectively .\nin this situation , the array of 16 monopole antennas surrounds the breast and can be moved to multiple vertical positions .\nthe antennas and target are submerged in a solution of glycerin and water which is lossy over the operating frequency range ( 700  mhz3  ghz ) .\nearly empirical tests have indicated that reflections off the tank side walls do not impact the desired signals for an array with the antennas mounted on a 15.2  cm diameter circle .\nlikewise , analysis of the monopole beam patterns as a function of frequency has shown that artifacts are minimal when the array approaches the liquid interface at the top of the tank .\nwith respect to reflections off the bottom surface , the base of the tank was at least 1.8 wavelengths ( at the lowest frequency ) below the active sections of the antennas in our initial clinical installation when the array was located at its lowest position during an exam .\nsince minimal multipath signals resulted from reflections off the top liquid surface , symmetry would suggest that the same should be true for the base of the tank ( figure 1(b ) ) .\nhowever , surface waves can cause multipath signals that can be especially difficult to eliminate in near - field systems\n. their excitation can be complex , but their propagation characteristics along two material interfaces , whether planar or along cylindrically shaped structures , have previously been studied in depth [ 1520 ] .\nsurface waves can readily propagate at the interface of two dielectric materials or one conductor juxtaposed directly with a dielectric .\ntheir propagation and attenuation characteristics are nominally determined by the electrical properties of the two materials .\nin addition , their amplitude decays exponentially away from the interface in the perpendicular direction as a function of the lossiness of the complementary materials .\nit should be noted that these investigations have stemmed partially from our efforts to perform microwave tomographic images on patients in an actual mr scanner for the purpose of exploiting the refined spatial resolution of the mr along with the more specific nature of the tissue dielectric properties .\nthe mr bore is quite small and places a significant constraint of space for the microwave system .\nthis was where we first encountered multipath signal corruption which subsequently led to this study . in the following sections , we discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these modes for the geometries present in our system .\nwe demonstrate cases from our current imaging system , where the measurements indicate corruption of the desired signals from multipath signals associated with the base of the tank .\nwe then show experiments that allow us to partially isolate the effects to surface waves propagating along other pathways .\nwe realize that there are a number of propagation modes around the antennas , their feedlines and the tank surfaces , of which the surface waves are only one possible contributor , but understanding these contributions is important .\nwe present an initial strategy for minimizing the effects of these signals which may be instructive for designing other near - field imaging systems , including simulations confirming the earlier theoretical discussion and validating our feedline design strategy .\na challenging situation occurs when a portion of the transmitted signal propagates along an unwanted path and recombines with the original signal at the receiver .\ntime - gating strategies can sometimes be effective when the nature of the multipath signal is well understood [ 1 , 2 ] .\nthe potential influence of a multipath signal when the original transmission is a continuous wave can be written as \n ( 1)resultant  signal = acombcos(t+comb ) , \n where \n ( 2)comb = acombtan1(b1a1),acomb = a12+b12,a1=[adecosde+ampcosmp],b1=[adesinde+ampsinmp ] . \n here ,\nade , amp , de , and mp are the desired and multipath signal amplitudes and phases , respectively ,  is the operating frequency , and t is time .\nfor example , if the magnitude of the multipath signal is 25  db below that of the desired signal , the maximum possible amplitude and phase errors in the resultant signal would be 0.48  db and 3.22 , respectively . for a 15  db multipath signal\n, these values increase to 1.42  db and 10.24. clearly , the resultant phase and amplitude errors can become very significant for multipath signals that are on the same order of magnitude as the desired signals .\nit should be noted that there can be many multipath contributions with a range of amplitude and phase contributions .\nthis single contributor analysis serves to give a flavor that the unwanted effects can be significant and is generalizable to multiple sources .\nthe first surface mode to be considered involves propagation along the interface between the tank base and coupling liquid . following the analysis by stratton , figure 3 shows a plane wave in region 1 impinging on an interface ( x = 0 ) with region 2 . in this case\n, the magnetic field ( hy ) is only oriented in the y - direction ( out of the page ) .\nthe complex relative dielectric properties in the two regions are 1 = 1  j1 and 2 = 2  j2 , respectively .\nthe classic surface wave solution occurs when the reflection coefficient is zero ( at the brewster angle ) , which is complex - valued in this instance .\nif a is the amplitude of the incident plane wave , then the magnetic component of the incident and transmitted waves can be represented as \n ( 3)hy = ae[jh1xjz ] ,  x>0,hy = ae[jh1xjz ] ,  x<0 , \n where h1 +  = k1 and h2 +  = k2 are needed to satisfy the wave equation , k1 and k2 are the wave numbers for the two regions , and  is the propagation constant .  \nthe wave impedances for the two regions are given by \n ( 4)z1=h1k1z1=h1k1z011j1,z2=h2k2z2=h2k2z012j2 , \n where z1 and z2 are the free space impedances in the corresponding regions , and z1 and z2 are the associated wave impedances [ 21 , 22 ] .\nthis yields \n ( 5)h1=h2 , \n where \n ( 6)=21=2j21j1. \n from these relationships , we can solve for \n ( 7)h1=k01(1)12,h2=k012(1)12,=k01(1)12 . \n \nin this situation , we are primarily interested in surface waves propagating along the outside of a coaxial cable , and their associated attenuation as a function of distance after the mode has been sufficiently established . for this analysis , we will consider the case of a coaxial line which is abruptly terminated by an open end ( figure 4 ) .\na coaxial cable supports a tem - mode electromagnetic field which is incident on the cable opening .\npart of the signal is partially reflected into the cable , while a second portion is transmitted as a surface wave propagating along the outside of the surrounding cable .\nthe fields transmitted into the surrounding space can be determined from the distribution at the coaxial opening which can be found by solving the integral equation for the radial component of the electric field over the opening : \n ( 8)14+jcabe(,0)kc(,)d  = j1abe(,0)kc(,)d0cosejkrrd , \n where c and 1 are the complex - valued permittivity of the coaxial cable insulator and the surrounding dielectric materials , respectively , a and b are inner and outer coaxial radii , respectively ,  is the operating frequency in radians , and k is the wavenumber in the coupling liquid , where 0 is the free space magnetic permeability .  and  are the radial cylindrical coordinates within and outside of the coaxial cable , respectively ,  is the angular coordinate within the coaxial cable , and r is defined as r=2+2 - 2cos. the variable kc( ,  ) is represented as \n ( 9)kc(,)=jn=0n()n()an2n , \n where \n ( 10)n()=y0(na)j1(n)j0(na)y1(n),n={kc2n2,kc>njn2kc2,kc>n , an2=22n2[j02(na)j02(nb)1 ] ,  n>0,a02=lnba . \n\nthe eigenvalue n are solutions of the characteristic equation : \n ( 11)y0(na)j1(nb)=j0(na)y1(nb ) , \n where jn and yn are bessel functions of the first and second kind of order n , respectively , and kc is the wavenumber inside the coaxial line .\nonce e( , z = 0 ) is determined , then electric and magnetic fields can be found at any point (  , z ) in the surrounding medium from \n ( 12)e(,z)=1abe(,0)0(jk+1r )  zcosejkrrdd , \n or \n ( 13)e(,z)=1abe(,0)  0[1(jk+1r)]cosrejkrrddh(,z)=j1abe(,0)  0cosejkrrdd , \n where \n ( 14)r=z2+2+22cos. \n from these equations it follows that the electromagnetic fields inside the surrounding medium decay approximately as e. \n figure 2(a ) shows the illumination tank used in our current clinical breast imaging system .\neach monopole antenna consists of an exposed length ( 3.8  cm ) of 2.2  mm diameter semirigid coaxial cable with only the center conductor and insulating teflon layer intact . for mechanical robustness\n, the coaxial feed line is enclosed in a 6.4  mm diameter rigid stainless steel tube , and the active section of the antenna is covered with an accompanying length of a delrin cylinder acting as a protective radome .\nthe space between the copper coaxial outer conductor and the stainless steel sleeve is sealed at either end with silver epoxy to eliminate wave propagation along the gap .\nthe antennas have a nominal return loss of 10  db over the bandwidth of 7003000  mhz .\nthe black delrin fittings at the antenna / tank base contain hydraulic seals through which the antenna feeds pass to allow vertical motion of the array while eliminating any coupling fluid leakage .\nthe 16 antennas are positioned on a 15.2  cm diameter circle , and both sets of 8 interleaved antennas are supported by individual mounting plates under the tank which provide independent motion of the array in groups of 8 . the tank is fabricated out of plexiglas with an inner wall diameter of 27.3  cm and thickness of 1.3  cm , and the base has a thickness of 2.5  cm .\nall connecting cables are double - braided to minimize stray radiation . in these experiments ,\nthe antennas were positioned at heights close to the tank base ( that were not used in any clinical exams ) to study the multipath phenomenon in detail .\nfigures 5(a ) , 5(b ) , and 5(c ) show three illumination tanks with different heights , arrays of monopole antennas , and coaxial feed lines that were fabricated from the same plexiglas and had identical diameters and wall / base thicknesses as figure 2(a ) tank .\nthe feed lines passed through holes in the base of each tank and were fastened to sma flange connectors which were bolted to the tank floor .\nthe tanks were filled with an 80  :  20 glycerin / water mixture with the liquid level 1.5  cm above the antenna tips . in figures 5(a ) and 5(c ) , the feed lines were both 10  cm long ; however , the latter was bent in a serpentine shape such that the top height of the feed line was only 5  cm above the tank floor . the feed line in figure 5(b ) was straight and was only 5  cm long . in these experiments\n, we used plexiglas for the tank materials with a dielectric constant of r = 2.7 that was effectively lossless in this frequency range .\nthe dielectric properties of the 80  :  20 glycerin / water bath are plotted in figure 6 as a function of frequency .\nutilizing the clinical system described in section 2.2 , a + 5  dbm signal was transmitted at multiple frequencies over the 7002500  mhz range from a single antenna and received at the remaining 15 antennas .\nthis sequence was repeated for the array positioned at multiple heights above the tank base .\nreceive antenna amplitudes are plotted for representative frequencies in figure 7 . at 900  mhz , the measured levels are high for the receivers closest to the transmitter ( relative receiver numbers 1 , 2 , 14 , and 15 ) compared to the rest of the array and do not change dramatically with changes in antenna height .\nhowever , the amplitudes are considerably lower for the more distant receive antennas . for antenna heights 7  cm or greater ( above the tank floor )\n, the attenuation follows a smooth curve hitting a maximum at antenna 8 ( which is furthest away from the transmitter being located on the opposite side of the array ) . at antenna heights 5  cm and lower ,\nthe behavior is consistent with the three frequencies shown in figure 7 . given that the distance from the antennas to the tank side walls did not change during the experiments , and that the antennas were sufficiently far from the liquid / air interface at all times for any array heights ( 10  cm in the worst case ) , the corruption of these most distantly received signals appears to be caused by multipath propagation associated with antenna tip proximity to the base of the tank most probably due to reflections off of the tank base or surface wave propagation along the dielectric interfaces . in this set of experiments\nfigures 8(a ) and 8(b ) show the received signals for a single transmitter over a range of frequencies for straight feed line lengths of 10  cm and 5  cm ( tanks in figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) ) , respectively . for the longer ( 10  cm ) lines in figure 8(a ) ,\nthe field patterns appear well - behaved like those in the previous section , when the array was positioned at the largest heights above the tank floor . however , the patterns for the shorter ( 5  cm ) line lengths in figure 8(b ) exhibit corruption of the signals resulting from the longer propagation distances similarly to when the array heights were closest to the base of the tank for the clinical system ( in figure 7 ) .\nthese corrupted signals are nominally between 50 to 70  dbm and occur in uneven patterns relative to the same signals from the longer feed lines which reach 80 to 90  dbm at the furthest antenna . for the shorter propagation distances ( i.e. , the signals received at antennas 14 and 1215 ) , the attenuation patterns from the shorter and longer feed lines are similar ( figure 8(b ) versus 8(a ) ) .\nthese results suggest that the unwanted multipath signal effect is the same in both the experimental tanks and the clinical system tests in the previous section and depends on the antenna height from the base of the tank .\nhowever , in figure 8(c ) , the antenna feed length is exactly the same as in figure 8(a ) , but is curved such that the antenna tip is the same height above the tank floor as the antennas in figure 8(b ) ( which led to signal corruption ) ; yet , the measurement results emulate those in figure 8(a ) ( which are not corrupted ) . here\n, the active part of the antennas is still positioned on the same 15.2  cm diameter circle as in the other two tanks .\nthese findings show that the principle signal corruption observed in figure 8(b ) is not due to reflections off the tank floor ; otherwise it would have appeared in figure 8(c ) since the antennas are at the same position above the base for both figures 8(b ) and 8(c ) .\nit should be noted that the signal disruptions for this situation appear more substantial than that for the antennas used in the clinical system as discussed in section 3.1 .\nthis is very likely due to differences in the designs of the hydraulic seals , feedline shielding , and antenna radome for the other system .\nmore likely , the multipath signals in figure 8(b ) ( with short feed lines ) result from surface waves traveling along the outside of the coaxial lines , across the plexiglas / liquid and/or plexiglas / air interface and back up the outside of the receiver coaxial feed .\nthe theoretical considerations in section 2.2 indicate that the attenuation along the coaxial lines is far more substantial than from the planar tank - base surface wave modes .  \nfigure 9(a ) shows a plot of attenuation as a function of frequency for 15.2  cm of plexiglas / liquid surface waves and indicates that very little attenuation of a surface wave propagating along this interface occurs at the frequencies we used .\nthus , in our experiments , the real source of surface wave attenuation comes from propagation along the outside of the coaxial lines .  \nfigure 9(b ) shows plots of the attenuation that results from single 5 and 10  cm lengths of feed line in the coupling fluid .\nthe theoretical predictions of attenuation along the two 5  cm antenna feed lengths ( transmit and receive ) and the path along the plexiglas base / liquid interface are approximately 70  db ( { 2  34  db } + 2  db ) for the 1  ghz case ( values interpolated from figures 9(a ) and 9(b ) ) . given a transmit power level of + 5  dbm , the resultant 65  dbm multipath signal for the shorter line would easily corrupt the desired 81  dbm signal ( figure 8(a ) ) .\nonly when the feed lines are nearly doubled in length , and the associated surface wave attenuation increased accordingly is the corruption of the desired signals reduced to an acceptable level .\nalong with the analytical discussion in sections 2.1 and 2.2 , we have also performed simulations of the configurations described in section 2.4 .\nfigures 10(a ) , 10(b ) , and 10(c ) show the 900  mhz electric field magnitude distributions for the long and short , straight antenna feed and the longer , serpentine structure , respectively .\nthese simulations were computed using ansys ( burlington , ma , usa ) hfss version 13.0 . for all cases , there is a reasonably broad antenna pattern emanating outwards from the active part of the antennas , and this feature is reasonably similar for all feed line types . for the straight feeds  especially the longer one ,\nit is clear that there are considerable surface currents generated along the coaxial lines . for the shorter\nstraight one , there is a high degree of field strength along the coaxial line within the plexiglas volume below the horizontal interface .\nthe fields along the interface generally agree with our previous notion that the surface waves preferentially propagate within the lower - loss medium ( in this case the plexiglas ) as can be seen by the substantially greater amplitudes directly under the line .\nthe results for the serpentine feedlines are consistent with previous results in that the field strength in the plexiglas is lower than that for the short , straight line case .  \nfigure 11 shows a plot of the field strength just below the liquid interface from a point directly underneath the antenna extending 140  cm to the right for all three corresponding plots .\nthe field values are considerably less for the longer straight line but are also less for the serpentine cases compared to the short , straight cases . for the serpentine case\n, there seems to be some signal coupling between the lower feedline bend and the plexiglas .\nas discussed in section 1 , surface waves do decay exponentially from the surfaces , and given the proximity of the feedlines and the liquid / plexiglas interface , some coupling is expected .\nthe potentially debilitating effects of unwanted multipath signals is a critical consideration in translating near - field microwave imaging approaches into clinical and commercial systems . for our noncontacting antenna approach ,\nsurface waves ( relative to signal reflections from the imaging tank walls ) appear to cause the biggest effects as they propagate along the outside of the transmitting coaxial line across the illumination tank floor and back up the coaxial feed lines of the receivers .\nwhen the imaging tank is deep and the transmitting / receiving antenna tips are sufficiently far above the tank base , the surface wave signals are adequately suppressed relative to the transmissions through tissue .\nthe results presented here indicate that 9 - 10  cm of distance along the feed line is adequate .\nhowever , reducing the tank depth is of interest for practical reasons and is essential in some settings and appears possible because reflections from the floor of the tank are still too small to degrade the measured signals propagating through tissue .\nindeed , we found that antenna tip distances as little as 5  cm from the tank floor maintain receiver signal fidelity across the array provided the surface wave contributions are attenuated through an equivalent feedline length approaching 10  cm .\nthese findings are significant because they indicate that the antenna array and imaging tank geometry can be altered substantially by manipulating the shape of the antenna feed line , which can be exploited to ensure sufficient surface wave attenuation .\nthere are certainly other mechanisms for multipath propagation including coupling of fields from the feedlines directly to portions of the breast tissue outside the immediate plane of propagation and are certainly good topics for further investigation ."}

76 years ) .\none patient was diagnosed with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome ( nbccs ) and showed multiple keratocystic odontogenic tumors ( kcot ) in the maxilla and mandible .\ntwo of these cysts were treated with marsupialization.(table 1 ) jaw cysts were observed in 10 patients ( 58.8% ) in their teens or 20s , which was a higher rate compared to other age groups , and the sex ratio was 1:1.4 with seven males ( 41.2% ) and 10 females ( 58.8%).(fig .\n2 ) radiographic results showed that all lesions were unilocular and were either pushing or intruding into the surrounding structures ( maxillary sinus or mandibular canal ) in 15 patients ( 88.2% ) . based on the results of the histopathologic examination , 10 patients were diagnosed with kcot ( 58.8% ) , five patients with dentigerous cysts ( dc ) ( 29.4% ) , one patient with radicular cyst ( rc ) ( 5.9% ) , and one patient with nasopalatine duct cyst ( 5.9% ) .\nonly one patient ( 5.9% ) was treated with marsupialization only , and 16 patients ( 94.1% ) were treated with marsupialization followed by enucleation . there was no case where the preoperative histopathologic results changed after the operation .\nthe average time of decompression was 8.13.4 months , with 5.54.8 months for a cyst in the mandible and 8.33.1 months for the maxilla .\nthe average time of decompression based on lesion type was 8.83.2 months for kcot and 6.02.7 months for dc , suggesting that kcots require approximately three more months of treatment .\nthe li was measured at an average of 1,349 mm before decompression and 463 mm after decompression , showing an average size decrease of 64% after decompression .\naccording to nakamura 's formula , five patients ( 29.4% ) showed a greater than 80% decrease in size , nine patients ( 52.9% ) showed a 50%-80% decrease in size , and three patients ( 17.6% ) showed a less than 50% decrease in size.(fig .\n3 ) the mandible decreased by 10% more in size than the maxilla , and it had a 1.7-fold higher reduction rate in the same period . also , when comparing size reduction based on patient age , the decrease was greater in patients in their teens or 20s compared to the other age groups , but the reduction rates were not significantly different .\nmales were observed to have a smaller final lesion size , while the reduction ratio was higher in females ; however , no significant differences were observed .\nadditionally , larger lesions reduced faster that smaller ones , and kcots showed more positive results for decompression than other lesion types.(table 2 ) one patient 's recovery was complicated by hypoesthesia after marsupialization , but this naturally recovered over time .\nthe total follow - up period was 1 to 8 years , and 3 out of 17 patients were suspected recurrence .\nhowever , one patient was diagnosed with scar tissue after re - examination , and one patient was diagnosed with periapical cyst due to re - infection of an incomplete root canal treatment .\na true recurrence appeared on one nbccs patient 's left maxilla and is currently being followed - up after re - operation .\nsince decompression was introduced as a conservative treatment for odontogenic cyst , many cases have been treated with decompression , and various studies have reported high success rates89 . however , the reaction varies depending on the cyst .\nanavi et al.10 conducted decompression on 57 patients who were diagnosed with kcot , dc , or rc , and no statistically significant differences in reduction rate were reported based on the histologic diagnosis . in present study ,\nthe reduction rate in kcot was higher than the other cysts , with an average of 131.84 mm / month , with the final reduction being the highest .\nthis is because kcots are aggressive , so the size of the lesion tends to be greater than that of other cystic lesions . according to this study , cases of li larger than 1,000 mm showed twice the sensitivity of li smaller than 1,000 mm .\ntherefore , in this study , kcot patients seemed to have a higher sensitivity to decompression since the li was larger than 1,000 mm .\nthere are no formal criteria for the decompression period or change in size ; however , according to previous studies , a 65% reduction was reported when maintained for an average of 8.4 months .\nadditionally , an 81% reduction was observed when decompression was maintained for an average of 17.5 months911 .\nanother study reported that it is preferable to perform enucleation if the size of the lesion after decompression decreases more than 50%-60%8 . in this study , the average decompression period was 8.1 months , and the lesions showed an average reduction of 64% .\nthe effects of decompression based on age are controversial , as it was reported that younger patients had higher reduction rates10 , but it also was reported that decompression is not correlated with age12 .\ntherefore , even at older ages , if a large cystic lesion exists within the jaw , postoperative complications can be reduced by decreasing size via decompression .\nbrndum and jensen13 performed enucleation after decompression in 12 patients with kcot ; during 7 to 17 years of follow - up , no recurrence was reported .\nsuch low recurrence rates were reported in many studies , and some of them reported biopsy results indicating that the histological characteristics of the residual cyst epithelium changed from parakeratinization to orthokeratinization or were no longer observed14 .\nbased on these results , august et al.11 reported that histological changes are likely to appear when decompression is maintained for longer than nine months , and he proposed a decompression period of at least nine months .\nthis study used a panoramic radiograph to two - dimensionally evaluate the lesion by measuring the maximum vertical and horizontal widths of the lesion .\nthis method is widely used because of ease , but it has a disadvantage in accuracy , as it two - dimensionally evaluates a three - dimensional lesion .\ntherefore , a recent method of measuring volume via three - dimensional analysis using a computer program was introduced15 .\nhowever , this method requires a special program and skilled technique , so it can be difficult to apply clinically . although plane analysis was performed in the present study due to lack of data for three - dimensional analysis , a more accurate analysis is expected once sufficient data is obtained .\nthis study was limited in that statistical analysis was not performed due to lack of samples .\nthus , when a lesion is large , reducing its size via decompression not only allows for conservative treatment , but it can also minimize complications .\naccording to this study , all patients treated with decompression were reported to have shown a reduction in lesion size and higher sensitivity with a larger lesion size .\nthere was no difference in the effect of decompression based on age , and only one patient experienced recurrence of the cyst ."}

{"id": 75, "text": "many studies over the past 15 years have focused on discovering solvents that help promote efficient cc bond formation under benign reaction conditions .\nnew solvents in dielsalder(2 ) and barbier reactions have been sought to help streamline the one - pot transformations further , reducing synthetic steps and organic waste .\npolar media often accelerate reactions of this type which has led to the use of water as an acceptable solvent for such organic conversions .\nrecent contributions from our laboratory to this field have centered on coupling reactions between propargyl aldehydes and allyl or propargyl halides under barbier conditions to form homoallylic and homopropargylic propargyl alcohols .\nthese compounds find wide use as synthetic templates and show a propensity for oxy - cope rearrangements ( scheme 1 ) .\nthe use of -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 4 ) , coupled with a propargyl aldehyde should offer an easy route into formation of enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures ( scheme 2 ) .\nprevious studies revealed that formation of 2 or 3 under indium - promoted barbier conditions is solvent dependent .\nuse of an organic solvent for the coupling reaction results in a mixture of 2 and 3 while the use of water as a solvent yields 2 as the sole product .\nit is possible that water protonates the coupled product to form 2 quickly , quenching the alkoxide intermediate , thereby suppressing the possible oxy - cope pathway shown in scheme 1 .\nit may also be possible that the increased polarity of the solvent itself stabilizes the anion formed upon coupling , thus raising the relative rate of cope rearrangement in this system . with a less polar , aprotic solvent ,\nthe anion will not be quenched , nor will it be stabilized to the same extent as witnessed in water .\na combination of these phenomena may be why an oxy - cope rearrangement occurs under less polar conditions , forming product 3 ( scheme 1 ) .\na coupling reaction between 1 and 4 ( scheme 2 ) was conducted under aqueous conditions to form 2 ( y = sph ) , with good regioselectivity ; however , the rate of this reaction is surprisingly slow .\nalthough reactions of the type shown in scheme 1 are reported in the literature to be accelerated by polar solvents such as water , coupling reactions between 1 and 4 , as shown in scheme 2 , are quite slow . indeed ,\nwhen water is used as the solvent , reactions often require 1036 h for completion .\nthis oil has a density greater than that of water so it is presumed to be an organometallic species formed by interaction of the indium metal with the halide species .\nisolation of the oil followed by workup in an acidic thf / h2o mixture leads to isolation of propargylphenyl sulfide and , to a smaller extent , the aldehyde .\nwe surmise that low solubility of this organometallic complex leads to poor reagent mixing , slowing the barbier coupling under aqueous conditions .\nsecond , indium - promoted coupling reactions conducted in water become more acidic as the reaction proceeds .\nwe believe it is possible that the aldehyde is in equilibrium with its corresponding hydrate species , reducing the electrophilicity of the carbon center .\na combination of these two reasons would lead to a decrease in the rate of reaction between 1 and 4 when conducted in an aqueous solvent .\nthe reaction proceeds more quickly ( 812 h ) in dmf , a less polar solvent , due to better solubility of all reagents , however , a mixture of 2 and 3 was isolated .\nit was originally expected that a mixture of water and dmf would lead to faster reaction times while still maintaining regiocontrol of product formation . the use of a water / dmf solvent system , however , resulted in a mixture of products with water constituting up to 50% v / v of the solvent system .\nwhen water exceeds 50% v / v of the solvent system , only product 2 is isolated , but the rate of reaction slows perceptively once again . to help expedite this reaction sequence ,\nwe began a search for solvent with polarity similar to , or greater than that of water .\nit was expected that an extremely polar organic solvent would promote the same type of acceleration normally witnessed in barbier couplings carried out under aqueous conditions .\nan organic solvent could also help solubilize the intermediate and reduce possible formation of the hydrate species , thus allowing for a faster coupling reaction to occur .\nif increased polarity stabilizes the anion formed by coupling of 1 and 4 , oxy - cope rearrangement should also be suppressed . with a dielectric constant of 186.9 at 25 c , significantly greater than that of water ( 78.37(7 ) ) , and dmf ( 38.3(7b ) ) ,\nn - methylformamide ( nmf ) has found occasional use in previous reactions requiring polar organic solvents ; however , it has historically found more widespread use as an organic reagent . with a pka of approximately 24,(7d )\nnmf is reactive under a range of organometallic reagent conditions , limiting its use as a solvent .\nindium - promoted coupling reactions , however , have been shown to be accelerated under aqueous conditions,(1 ) and the relative acidity of nmf , being higher than that of water , should not hinder the proposed barbier couplings proposed within this paper .\nwe were especially intrigued by the fact that the dielectric constant of nmf increases to 220 as the temperature is lowered from 25 to 0 c .\nwe were interested in examining what effect the increase in dielectric constant at lower temperature could have on a barbier - style reaction of the type shown in scheme 2 among others .\nthis paper reports on the use of nmf in barbier - style reactions with a focus on rates of reaction , stereochemistry , and its use to form enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures.(9 )\nalthough nmf has characteristics similar to those of dmf , it also has characteristics similar to water , such as a polar xh bond.(7 ) thus , having found a very polar solvent with properties similar to both water and organic systems , we hypothesized that the 1,2-coupling product could be formed in high yield under short reaction times .\na series of reactions was set up to test this hypothesis . as shown in table 1 , use of either water or\nnmf resulted in formation of the 1,2-product ( 2 ) solely with no trace of 3 detected in the product mixture .\nalthough the yield of product was moderate to high in either solvent , product formation in reactions conducted in nmf proceeded at a much greater rate .\nwe believe that there are two possible reasons behind the rate increase of coupling reactions carried out in nmf .\nthe ratio of reagent was as follows : 1.0:1.5:1.1 ( aldehyde / halide / indium ) .\nthe reaction was run at 0.1 m with respect to indium . in the lewis acid catalyzed reaction , 10 molar % of the lewis acid was used .\nall species completely dissolved in nmf , unlike what was observed for reactions in water . as such , we believe mixing is much more efficient , allowing the reaction to proceed at a faster rate .\nhas also been noted in many literature examples to lead to rate enhancement in indium - promoted barbier reactions .\nwe believe a mixture of better solubility coupled with greater solvent polarity results in an additive effect toward increasing the rate of reactions conducted in nmf when compared to water .\nh - bonding capabilities of nmf may explain the greater regioselectivity for reactions conducted in nmf when compared to those observed in dmf and thf ; however , the h - bonding capacity of nmf is much lower than that of water.(7d ) increased solvent polarity , thus increasing the stability of the intermediate anion and raising the relative energy of the oxy - cope rearrangement , may seem more likely at this time . in an effort to exclude the solvent as a direct participant in intermediate formation when nmf is used , nmr spectroscopy studies were performed to determine if a possible hemiaminal or imminium species was forming in situ ( figure 1 ) .\nthe imminium functionality carries a positive charge and would increase the electrophilicity of the reactive carbon .\nmixing of 1 and nmf under sonication for periods of up to 24 h , however , revealed the presence of only 1 and nmf by nmr spectroscopy . possible formation of hemiaminal or imminium species . the presence or absence of a lewis acid has shown to help control stereoselectivity in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions .\nprevious studies in our laboratory have shown that the addition of indium(iii ) chloride as a lewis acid favors formation of the syn - product in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions between 4 and aldehyde functional groups . in the absence of the lewis acid ,\nthe anti - product is favored ( figure 2).(5b ) it was our hope that similar effects would be witnessed in the present system , especially while using nmf as the reaction solvent , and we were pleased to see this trend continue .\nabsence of a lewis acid in the reagent mixture favored a nonchelated pathway , leading to formation of anti-2 .\nuse of indium chloride to control stereochemistry.(5b ) the presence of a lewis acid in the reaction mixture favored a chelated pathway , leading to formation of syn-2 ( figure 3 ) .\ndiastereoselectivities were determined either by direct measurement of vicinal coupling constants in the hydroxyl sulfide or by corresponding conversion to the epoxide compounds as shown in figure 4.(11 ) general j values for hydroxyl sulfides and epoxide structures .\nentries 1 , 5 , and 13 ( table 1 ) describe reactions run in nmf in the absence of a lewis acid .\ngood anti - selectivity is witnessed with ratios as high as 15:85 ( syn / anti ) . in all cases , with\nthe exception of r = phenyl , systems , with and without incl3 , run in nmf gave better selectivity than systems run in water .\nboth systems showed poor selectivity when r = tms for reasons of which we are not quite sure . when incl3 was added as a lewis acid , the chelated route was favored in ratios as high as 90:10 ( syn : anti , entry 15 ) .\nn - methylformamide was shown to increase the rate of reaction compared with water and offered better stereocontrol in the systems studied .\nenediyne and epoxydiyne functionalities contain either a ( z)-3-ene-1,5-diyne or ( z)-3-epoxy-1,5-diyne unit which leads to their noted activity.(9 ) these unique functional groups cyclize to form a p - benzyne- or p - benzyne - like intermediate that interacts with dna by abstracting hydrogen.(9 ) the dna diradical then either couples with itself , or cleaves , stopping replication .\nnatural product enediyne and epoxydiynes have found use as anticarcinogenic compounds.(9 ) this area of study is slowed , however , by complicated access into the skeletal systems required.(9 ) literature procedures that find use in epoxy alkyne formation such as halohydrin cylization,(12)m - cpba,(13 ) or oxone(14 ) have been shown to be successful , but limited examples are known with these systems at present . under the barbier coupling conditions described in this paper , formation of compound 2 offers an efficient and controlled method for the formation of either an enediyne or epoxydiyne skeletal structure under benign conditions by allowing easy conversion to either the cis - epoxydiyne ( from syn-2 , scheme 3 ) or the cis - enediyne ( from anti-2 , scheme 4 ) .\nfacile synthesis of epoxydiyne and enediyne functional groups under the reported conditions would allow for their use as template structures in organic synthesis , opening access to more sophisticated units for further exploration . in the following pages , we describe the transformation of 1 into either an epoxydiyne ( 5 ) or enediyne ( 6 ) skeletal structure in two steps with high regio- and stereocontrol using nmf as a new solvent to form 2 under barbier conditions , followed by a one - step transformation to yield either 5 or 6 . as shown in scheme 3 , syn-2 can adopt the correct conformation to form a cis - oxirane upon reaction with either me3obf4 or tloet .\nconversion of the hydroxy sulfide starting material ( 2 ) to the epoxyalkyne product ( 5 ) was quite successful as shown in table 2 . in all cases ,\nthis fact is worth mentioning as barbier reactions with propargyl halides can lead to rearrangement of the organometallic intermediate into an allenyl product .\nreagent 4 has been previously shown to offer one of the few examples of a barbier reaction with a propargyl halide where rearrangement does not occur.(5b ) use of tloet(17 ) gave yields similar to that of me3obf4(18 ) in all cases of oxirane formation , with stereoselectivity preserved under both sets of conditions .\nuse of the anti-2 allows formation of the ( e)-alkene ( the alkyne functional groups are cis to each other ) functional group by the pathway shown in scheme 4 .\nformation of the enediyne product was possible under slightly acidic conditions . a catalytic amount of p - tsoh is added to anti-2 in a mixture of water and thf ( 10% water ) with stirring for 37 h. the reaction was also conducted under basic conditions after transformation of the oh group to a tosylate .\nyields were quite low under basic conditions , presumably due to the competing acidity of the alkynyl proton , leading to decomposition and side product formation . due to low yields ,\nresults of the acid - catalyzed conversion of anti-2 to ( e)-6 are shown in table 3 .\na slight amount of isomerization was witnessed under acidic conditions ( about 3% of the product mixture ) , but overall , good stereocontrol was realized in these conversions , allowing for easy entry into the cis - enediyne ( ( e)-alkene ) skeletal structure in a two - step sequence .\nthe assignment of e- and z - isomers was made by comparison of the -vinyl proton shift .\nalignment of the -vinyl proton and the heteroatom cis to each other gives rise to a lower field proton resonance than trans alignment of these two groups ( figure 5).(19 ) the assignments for the enediyne products are compared correctly with the stereochemistry of compounds 2 and 3 within this study .\ncoupled with the original indium - promoted barbier reaction , the transformation of starting materials 1 and 4 into enediyne or epoxydiyne compounds proceeded in two steps in an overall 6080% overall yield , offering an efficient , benign , and good - yielding formation of these important skeletal structures .\nthe use of n - methylformamide is shown to be a nice alternative to aqueous conditions in indium promoted coupling reactions between propargyl aldehydes ( 1 ) and -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 4 ) .\nthis paper introduces the use of nmf as s viable solvent in a barbier coupling reaction , revealing increased rates and better selectivity when compared to reactions conducted in water and other organic solvents .\nthe increased efficiency of the barbier coupling reaction as described in this paper allows for facile formation of epoxy - and enediyne skeletal structures in an overall two - step procedure .\nthe introduction of nmf as an alternative solvent in barbier reactions will open new pathways to organic synthetic chemists . further studies to test other halides and aldehyde functional groups under barbier coupling reaction conditions in nmf are currently underway and will be reported in due time .\ntetrahydrofuran was purified by distillation under an argon atmosphere over sodium and benzophenone prior to use .\nradial chromatography was performed using a chromatatron . to a solution of 30 mmol of alkyne in 80 ml of thf that had been cooled to  60 c under nitrogen\nwas added 15 ml of n - buli ( 2.0 m in thf ) with stirring . to this solution\nwas added n , n - dimethylformamide ( 4.66 ml , 60 mmol ) dropwise over 10 min .\nafter 20 min of further stirring , the solution was added to a mixture of 75 ml of tert - butyl methyl ether and 160 ml of 10% kh2po4 solution which had been previously cooled to 0 c .\nthe entire solution was stirred at 0 c for 30 min and then allowed to warm to room temperature .\nthe organic layer was dried over mgso4 , and the solvent removed under vacuum to give a clear oil .\nall propargyl aldehydes were used without further purification and could be stored at 0 c for 23 weeks .\nyields for this reaction ranged from 85 to 95% . a magnetically stirred solution of aldehyde ( 1 ) ( 2.0 mmol ) in deionized water ( 22 ml ) was treated with -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 702 mg , 3.0 mmol ) and indium powder ( 228 mg , 2.0 mmol ) .\nthe solution was allowed to proceed at room temperature until no 1 was seen ( tlc analysis ) .\nthe layers were separated , and the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane ( 2  10 ml ) .\nthe combined organic layers

induced mouse sepsis model to reveal the role of baicalin in aki of pediatric sepsis .\nbaicalin adjunctive therapy in the patients and treatment in the mouse model decreased bun and cr levels .\nfurther histological and expression analyses suggested the suppressive function of baicalin in renal cell apoptosis .\nthe 50 pediatric patients participating in this study were chosen from pediatric sepsis patients diagnosed with aki , and the mouse model induced by clp was detected with elevated bun and cr levels , which suggested potential kidney injury .\nprevious studies using mouse sepsis models used various baicalin treatment methods , including topical application on the mouse skin to analyze the effect of baicalin on epidermis , intraperitoneal injection to investigate the role of baicalin in mammary glands , and baicalin - containing diets to study liver injury , inflammation in the kidney , and lung carcinoma [ 22,2729 ] . in these studies ,\nthe dose of baicalin was usually 100200 mg/(kgd ) , and the duration ranged from 3 to 50 days .\nthus , in the present study we chose to perform baicalin treatment in the model mouse via intragastric administration of 200 mg/(kgd ) for 6 days , and the significantly elevated bun and cr levels in the clp group compared to the sham group indicated that this treatment method effectively induced kidney injury in the mouse sepsis model .\nclinical trials with baicalin adjunctive therapy have focused on its protective roles in ulcerative colitis , hepatic fibrosis , and diabetes mellitus [ 3032 ] , and several studies have investigated the potential of baicalin in treating patients with early diabetic nephropathy , in which baicalin inhibits aldose reductase activity and reduces urinary albumin excretion rate and the blood 2-microglobulin .\nthe present study further discovered the protective role of baicalin against aki in pediatric sepsis patients , which was reflected in the reduced bun and cr levels .\nmoreover , the experiments in the mouse model confirmed that baicalin treatment in a sepsis animal model could improve renal functions .\nthese findings show the potential of using baicalin to attenuate aki in pediatric sepsis patients , but the proper dosage and possible complications need to be assessed in future research .\ntunel results showed that baicalin treatment in the mouse model significantly suppressed renal cell apoptosis , and western blot and qrt - pcr analyses indicated consistent changes in the expression of bax and bcl2 .\na similar mechanism has been reported in mouse mammary glands , where baicalin inhibits cell apoptosis via regulating bax and bcl2 .\nin addition , baicalin inhibits hepatocyte apoptosis in mouse kidney injury induced by concanavalin a ; therefore , suppressing renal cell apoptosis is likely to be one of the mechanisms by which baicalin attenuates septic kidney injury .\nhowever , the anti - proliferative role of baicalin has also been reported in studies on lung cancer and mouse embryonic stem cells , and it is converted to baicalin by intestinal gut flora to act as a pro - apoptotic and anti - proliferative substance .\nbaicalin is capable of promoting neuronal differentiation , and thus may benefit therapies for parkinson and alzheimer diseases .\nwe speculate that there are multiple potential mechanisms behind the effects of baicalin in various diseases ; therefore , it is necessary to uncover the detailed mechanisms in order to optimize use of baicalin to control aki in pediatric sepsis patients .\nthe investigations of baicalin in pediatric sepsis patients and the clp - induced mouse sepsis model reveal the protective role of baicalin against aki in pediatric sepsis .\nbaicalin can inhibit renal cell apoptosis , which may be one of its functional mechanisms .\nthis study provides a potential adjunctive therapy for treating aki in pediatric sepsis , and future research will concentrate on more detailed mechanisms of baicalin ."}

way analysis of variance .\nto investigate whether rage proteins are present in human lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells , we carried out western blot analysis using anti - rage antibody ( n-16 ) .\nrage proteins of different molecular weights were detected in a549 cells ( figure 1 ) . in full length rage\ncdna - transfected human hepatocellular carcinoma hep3b cells , the major band ( 57  kda ) ( indicated by an arrow in figure 1 ) represents the full - length rage protein .\nlikewise , the full - length rage protein was also detected in a549 and mock transfected hep3b cells .\nno bands were detected in a neutralization experiment using blocking peptide ( data not shown ) so the other bands may represent deglycosylated rage proteins .\nwe examined the effect of glycer - ages on the cell viability of a549 cells .\ncell viability was determined after 48  h incubation with control unglycated bsa or glycer - ages .\ntwenty , 50 , and 100  g / ml of glycer - ages significantly decreased cell viability to 83 , 64 , and 54% , respectively , ( figure 2(a ) ) .\nin contrast , control unglycated bsa had no effect . furthermore , glycer - ages significantly attenuated cell proliferation ( figure 2(b ) ) ; however , no cell death was induced by glycer - ages according to cell death detection elisa ( data not shown ) .\nwe examined the effect of glycer - ages on cell migration and invasion . in the migration assay ,\nthe glycer - ages - treated cells showed significantly ( 2.7 times higher ) greater migration than the control unglycated bsa - treated cells ( figure 3(a ) ) , and in the invasion assay , the glycer - ages - treated cells showed significantly ( 3.3 times higher ) greater invasion than the control unglycated bsa - treated cells ( figure 3(b ) ) . when glycer - ages were added to the lower chamber\n, there was no effect on the results of the invasion assay ( data not shown ) .\nthese results suggest that glycer - ages - rage interaction is necessary for cell migration and invasion .\nrho family small gtpases are widely accepted to be key regulators of actin reorganization and motility .\ninterestingly , rage signaling has been shown to result in the activation of rac1 [ 1720 ] , and the activation of rage by ages has been shown to induce the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) .\nthe glycer - ages - induced rac1 activity was about 2 times higher than that of the control unglycated bsa , and it was suppressed by pretreatment with n - acetyl - l - cysteine ( nac ) , an ros scavenger ( figure 4(a ) ) .\nlikewise , the glycer - ages - enhanced migration capacity was also significantly suppressed by pre - treatment with nac ( figure 4(b ) ) .\nthus , glycer - ages - rage interaction enhances migration capacity by activating rac1 via ros generation .\nmembers of the matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp ) family are widely accepted to be key regulators of tumor invasion [ 2224 ] .\nin particular , mmp-2 and -9 , which are called gelatinases , are key enzymes for degrading type iv collagen and are thought to play critical roles in tumor invasion and metastasis .\nwe examined the expression of transforming growth factor- ( tgf- ) and mmp-2 mrna and assessed mmp-2 activity with the mmp-2 biotrak activity assay system .\nneither the mrna expression of tgf- or mmp-2 was significantly increased by the addition of glycer - ages at 24  h ( figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) ) .\npro - mmp-2 activity was also not significantly altered by the addition of glycer - ages at 48  h ( figure 5(c ) )\n. however , glycer - ages only increased mmp-2 ( the activated form ) activity to 120% ( figure 5(d ) ) .\n    rage , which is a multiligand receptor , affects diseases such as cancer and diabetes through its ligands .\nseveral reports have suggested that rage and amphoterin are closely associated with invasion and metastasis in cancer cells [ 26 , 27 ] .\nages have been implicated in the development and progression of diabetic angiopathies , including skin dermopathy .\nhowever , it is still unclear which ages subtypes play a pathogenetic role and which ages receptors mediate the effects of ages on cells .\nwe have provided direct immunochemical evidence for the existence of six distinct ages structures within the ages - modified proteins and peptides that circulate in the sera of diabetic patients .\nrecently , we found that glycer - ages perform a diverse range of biological activities on vascular wall cells , mesangial cells , schwann cells , and cortical neurons [ 1013 ] .\nwe also found that glycer - ages , but not glucose - derived ages ( glc - ages ) , significantly stimulated the growth and migration of human melanoma cells .\nfurthermore , the tumor formation of melanoma cells xenografts in athymic mice was prevented by treatment with anti - rage antibody . in tumor bearing - mice ,\nsurvival rates were prolonged , and spontaneous pulmonary metastases were inhibited by treatment using anti - rage antibody . in addition , glycer - ages were present in the beds of human melanoma tumors , whereas they were hardly detected in normal skin .\nthese results suggest that glycer - ages are involved in the growth and invasion of malignant melanoma through their interactions with rage .\nrecently , we found that glycer - ages have the strongest binding affinity for rage [ 28 , 29 ] and subsequently elicit oxidative stress generation and evoke vascular inflammation , thereby implicating them in accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes [ 10 , 11 ] .\ntaken together , glycer - ages - rage interactions play an important role in the progression of melanoma cells to malignancy .\nhowever , the effects of glycer - ages on other cancer cells remain poorly understood , and the molecular mechanisms behind these effects have not been clarified .   in the present study\nrage includes full - length , c - truncated , and n - truncated rage . the rage antibody ( n-16 ) used in this study , which recognizes the n - terminus of rage , detects full - length and c - truncated rage .\nindeed , full - length rage ( 57  kda ) was detected in a549 cells .\nthe other bands may have represented the de - glycosylated form or c - truncated rage .\nglycer - ages are associated with cell cytotoxicity , but glc - ages are not [ 21 , 31 , 32 ] . in mesangial cells , intracellular ros produced by glycer - ages were found to induce apoptotic cell death . however , no a549 cell death induced by glycer - ages was observed in this study .\nit is thought that the cytotoxicity of glycer - ages depends on the sensitivity of their target cells to ros .\nfurthermore , glycer - ages enhanced the migration and invasion activity of the a549 cells , both of which are prominent features of cancer malignancy .\nglycer - ages induced the invasion of a549 cells across matrigel , indicating that matrix degradation and migration mechanisms had been stimulated in these cells . at the molecular level ,\nglycer - ages - induced phenomena resemble the effects of long - term oxidative stress or tgf-. both oxidative stress and tgf- are key regulators of the malignancy rather than the proliferation of cancer cells [ 3335 ] .\ntgf- strongly induces mmp-2 expression in a549 cells ; however , mrna expression of tgf- was not induced by glycer - ages , and the mrna levels of mmp-2 , which is produced by tgf- , did not change . in long - term oxidative stress , mori et al .\nshowed that intracellularly produced ros activated rac1   and enhanced the invasion capacity of tumor cells by activating mmp [ 33 , 3739 ] .\na recent report showed that sustained exposure of cells to h2o2 , but not one time exposure to h2o2 , increased pro - mmp-2 activation through the induction of membrane type 1-mmp ( mt1-mmp ) expression .\nindeed , our results also showed that glycer - ages enhanced the migration capacity of a549 cells by activating rac1 via ros and increased their invasion capacity by activating mmp-2 .\nhowever , glycer - ages only increased mmp-2 ( the activated form ) activity to 120% .\nit is suggested that the activation of other mmp such as mmp-13 may also participate in the above - mentioned changes , and future studies are necessary to clarify this matter . in conclusion\n, we demonstrated that glycer - ages enhanced the migration and invasion of a549 cells rather than their proliferation .\nthese results suggest that glycer - ages play a critical role in cancer malignancy and are potential targets for therapeutic intervention ."}
{"id": 78, "text": "malaligned implants often complicate the clinical laboratory procedures employed for fabrication of superstructures . due to improper load distribution ,\na stent is an appliance used for radiographic evaluation of height and width of the available bone during treatment planning for implant placement or during surgical procedures to provide site for optimum implant placement .\nthe variable type of stents includes vaccuform or acrylic resin templates adapted over duplicated casts of diagnostic wax -

up [ figure 3 ] . then , the impression of that waxed - up cast was taken and poured to reproduce another cast with the missing teeth / tooth replaced by dental stone .\nthen , mesiodistal and buccolingual markings were drawn over these teeth / tooth to find a center point on the occlusal surface [ figure 4 ] .\nlater on , after applying the separating media over these regions and filling the undercuts with wax , transparent self - curing material was applied at the teeth to be replaced along with some adjacent area antero - posteriorly , which confers the stability to the stent during implant placement [ figure 5 ] .\nthe holes were drilled in the stent so formed at the center point for the assessment of the diameter and position of implant and filled with gutta percha [ figure 6 ] .\nthis stent was placed in the mouth and radiograph was taken to evaluate the position of gutta percha .\nthe efficacy of stents was then evaluated at the time of surgical exposure for implant placement and after the surgery , with the help of radiographs [ figures 7 , 8 ] .\nintraoral view of the patient radiograph of the patients waxed -

posteriorly to cover enough area over the teeth / tooth present adjacent to edentulous area . in cases where no teeth are present ,\nstabilization of stent was achieved by extending it over the unreflected areas like retromolar regions .\nthis study shows the extreme accuracy of this conventional surgical stent . if each step of this protocol is followed precisely , it is possible to deliver an optimum implant installation in terms of position and diameter and later on function at a very much reduced rate and time , as taken in ct and cad / cam technology which are the most accepted methods"}

however , we did not find a negative correlation between total b cells and age , as previously reported ( 24,31 ) .\nthe current study went further than the examination of the frequency of total b cells , focusing on b - cell subsets with distinct immunological functions .\nof note , we found that patients with t1d or lada had an increased frequency of mzb cells but decreased frequency of fob cells compared with control subjects with ngt and patients with t2d . in all groups , we found that fcp was negatively associated with mzb cells but positively associated with fob cells .\nattanavanich and kearney ( 6 ) reported that mzb cells were more effective at activating naive cd4 t cells than fob cells .\nmzb cells in nod mice were also shown to be important antigen - presenting cells for the activation of t cells in pancreatic - draining lymph nodes ( 32 ) . given the negative correlation between mzb cells and fcp , it is possible that mzb cells may promote -cell destruction in patients with t1d or lada .\ndecreased frequency of fob cells in the circulation of patients with t1d and lada suggests that some fob cells migrated from the blood to the pancreas or the draining lymph nodes as a result of the local inflammatory response .\nalong with the disease progression , more immune cells are known to infiltrate to the islets of both nod mice and patients with t1d ( 5,33 ) , but the patients with t1d in the current study have a relatively long history of diabetes ( 3.1 years ) .\nthus , fob cells appear to be more important in initial rather than established pancreatic -cell autoimmunity ( 34 ) .\nwe showed that patients with t2d and lada more frequently had t2-mzp b cells than control subjects with ngt , which associates with parameters of blood pressure , lipidemia , and glycemia but not with hba1c or fcp .\nthese observations are consistent with a previous study showing that glycemia and lipidemia are associated with immune cells ( 35 ) . another interesting finding was the decrease of b10 cell frequency in all types of diabetes , being the lowest in t1d .\nwhether this phenotype is mediated through a common mechanism or different ones is not clear .\nwhat is clear is that immune mechanisms are involved and that more studies , especially functional studies , are required .\nalthough b cells are generally acknowledged for their function in humoral immune response by producing antibodies , they also have been demonstrated to play an immunoregulatory role in the prevention of autoimmune disease by producing il-10 and downregulating t - cell responses ( 13,14,36 ) .\nthe observed b10 cell reduction could contribute to the breakdown of self - tolerance that leads to -cell destruction in patients with t1d ( 24 ) or lada .\nantigen - activated il-10producing b cells may selectively inhibit autoreactive t - cell responses to islet - specific antigen to maintain self - tolerance , and hyperglycemic nod mice and patients with t1d lack this population of regulatory b cells ( 37 ) .\nin the clinical trial where b cells in patients with new - onset t1d were depleted , the patients showed a transient remission ( 8) .\nhowever , blanket targeting of all b cells , as used in the clinical trial and in treating other autoimmune disorders , needs to be improved by selectively deleting pathogenic b cells while preserving regulatory b cells to promote tolerance .\nour preclinical study showed that more regulatory b cells were regenerated after b - cell deletion in an animal model ( 38 ) .\nfurthermore , studies have shown that patients with long - standing t2d could have a secondary autoimmune response toward islet -cells ( 39 ) .\nthe reduction of b10 regulatory cells might contribute to the dysregulation of immune response in t2d .\na functional study on il-10producing b cells and further phenotyping will be the goal of future work . in the current study ,\nalthough we currently can not identify a specific subset that could be used for diagnostic purposes , the results strongly imply that the change of b - cell subtypes is related to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes .\ntherefore , it is important to reconsider the approach of b - cell  targeted therapy in patients with t1d and aim to selectively remove pathogenic b cells but promote regulatory b cells . in summary ,\nthe current data demonstrate distinct differences in the frequencies of peripheral b - cell subsets in t1d and lada , which are associated with islet function and glycemia .\nthe findings support the notion that these immunological alterations are involved in loss of self - tolerance and -cell destruction .\nthe findings also suggest that , similar to regulatory t - cell therapy , transfusion of ex vivo expanded autologous b10 cells might open a new and effective therapeutic strategy in treating autoimmune diabetes ."}

{"id": 81, "text": "according to numerous estimations , 15% to 29% of patients with cataract have 1.5 diopters ( d ) of refractive astigmatism.1,2 cataract surgeons usually prefer to treat cataract and correct refractive ( spherical and astigmatic ) disorders at the time of the surgery .\ncorneal incision ( astigmatic keratotomy ) and peripheral corneal relaxing incisions ( pcris ) were performed to treat these disorders.3,4 the main drawbacks of these approaches are that the outcome depends on multiple factors as the patient s age , the depth and length of the incision , complications related to wound healing , epithelial defects , or induction of dry - eye symptoms .\nthese parameters affect the visual outcome in a unpredictable way so the corneal incisions are not considered a reliable method for astigmatism correction .\ntoric intraocular lens ( iols ) implantation was introduced in the 1990 s as an option for astigmatism correction in cataract patients .\ninitially they presented the disadvantage of postoperative rotation that decreased the visual outcome.58 new toric iol designs ( acrysof   toric iol ; alcon , fort worth , tx ) , approved by the us food and drug administration ( fda ) at the end of 2005 , have been found to be more stable and appear to be the preferred iol for correcting preexisting astigmatism in conjunction with cataract surgery.9,10 the acrysof   iols are available in three options : t3 , t4 , and t5 of astigmatic correction 1.5 , 2.25 , 3.00 d , respectively ( at the iol plane ) .\nthe aim of this study is to report the clinical results of acrysof   toric iols implantation for preexisting astigmatism correction and compare the postoperative rotation of the iols one and six months postoperatively .\nthis prospective study included eyes that had cataract surgery at the papageorgiou general hospital , thessaloniki , greece , between may 2008 and december 2008 .\nthe study was conducted according to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and patients gave informed consent after the nature and intent of the study had been fully explained to them .\ninclusion criteria were : cataract , age 70 years or younger , and preoperative regular corneal astigmatism greater than 1.00 d. exclusion criteria were : glaucoma , corneal disease , previous corneal or intraocular surgery , macular degeneration or retinopathy , and history of ocular inflammation .\neach patient had a complete ophthalmologic examination , including visual acuity ( va ) , slit - lamp examination , intraocular pressure ( iop ) measurement , and dilated fundus examination .\ntopography ( magellan mapper ; nidek technologies , padova , italy ) , automated refractometry ( rk600 ; reichert , inc .\n, depew , ny ) , and ultrasonic immersion biometry ( ocuscan rxp ; alcon ) were performed to determine the appropriate iol spherical power .\ncylindrical power and axis placement to achieve emmetropia were calculated using an online toric iol calculator program ( available from http://www.acrysoforiccalculator.com/ ) .\nthe 0180 axis was marked with the patient in a sitting position to avoid cyclotorsion using the nuijts / lane preoperative toric reference corneal marker ( ae-2791tbl ; asico , westmont , il ) ( figure 1 ) .\nintraoperatively , the desired implantation axis was marked using an intra - op toric axis marker ii ( ae-2794 ; asico ) ( figure 2 ) .\na foldable iol was implanted in the capsular bag through a 2.75 mm limbal incision on 110. the toric iol was injected with a monarch - ii injector ( alcon ) and placed around 1015 off axis before the ophthalmic viscosurgical device ( sodium hyaluronate 1% ) was removed .\nafter ophthalmic viscosurgical device removal , the iol was rotated to its final position by exactly aligning the toric reference marks with the limbal implantation axis marks .\nall surgeries were performed by the same experienced surgeon ( it ) using topical anesthesia and a standard divide - and - conquer phacoemulsification technique . because of the intraoperative marker design and the pen mark fading during the operation in several cases , it was difficult to assess the proper alignment of the iol after its placement . because of this difficulty , an image was captured from the real - time streaming recording of the surgery and was assessed blindly by a second operator using a commercially available software ( screen protractor ; iconico , ny , usa ) ( unpublished data ) . to overcome this difficulty we consider that the use of the marker set consisting of beveled degree gauge ( ae-1590 ; asico ) and maloney astigmatism axis marker ( ae-2741 ; asico ) is more appropriate for the whole procedure because it allows maximum visibility .\nthe on - screen assessment of the axis remains a useful tool for postoperative evaluation of the iol location ( figure 3 ) .\nmeasurements of visual acuity ( using the snellen opto - type at a six - meter distance ) , iop , and comprehensive slit lamp examination were performed at one - day and one- and six - month postoperative visits . at the one- and six - month follow - up\n, a digital photograph and corneal topography ( only at the one - month visit ) were obtained to estimate the postoperative rotation of the iol using the software tools mentioned above ( figure 1 ) .\noutcomes of interest included uncorrected va , cylindrical astigmatism power before and after iol implantation , and the possible rotation of the iol one and six months after the operation ( when the initial desired place was at 0 ) .\nabsolute values of the rotation used for the analysis after detecting rotation was not under investigation .\ncompleted data forms were analyzed with microsoft excel 2007 ( microsoft corporation , redmond , wa ) and spss software ( version 16.0 ; spss inc . , chicago , il ) .\ntwenty - nine eyes of 19 patients ( mean age 63.03  5.42 years ) were enrolled in this study .\nuncorrected va was found to be 5/10 or more in 26 of 29 eyes ( 89.7% ) and 8/10 or more in 19 of 29 patients ( 65.5% ) .\npreoperative and postoperative corneal topography showed significant reduction of refractive astigmatism in all eyes after the surgery .\nmean power of the astigmatism was 2.38  0.91 d ( range 1.55 d ) preoperatively and 0.64  0.61 d ( range 02.5 d ) postoperatively ( figure 4 ) .\none month postoperation , the mean toric iol axis rotation was 2.2  1.5 ( range 0.67.8 ) .\nsix months postoperation , the mean toric iol axis rotation was 2.7  1.5 ( range 0.98.4 ) .\nthe later rotation occurred between one and six months , and was found to be more than one degree ( 1.1 ) only in one eye ( 3% ) and in all other cases was less than this value ( figure 5 ) .\nit is known that one degree of deviation causes 3.3% reduction of the iol cylindrical power .\ncalculated reduction of the desired correction ( in diopters ) because of the observed rotation ( mean value , one and two standard deviations ) for the three iol models is shown in table 1 .\nno eye had secondary surgery to reposition the iol axis within the six - month postoperative period .\nthe results of our study corroborate previous studies,11 which demonstrates that proper selection and preoperative examination of patients followed by uncomplicated iol implantation of one - piece hydrophobic acrylic toric iols results in acceptable stability and visual outcome .\nin particular , the postoperative rotation of toric iols appears to occur in the early postoperative period ( 1 month ) and remains constant later than six months .\nthe lens rotates until a fibronectin and collagen adhesion develops between the iol and the posterior capsule , which prevents any further rotary motion.12 the amount of cylindrical correction reduction due to postoperative rotation was not large enough13 to affect the expected end result in final uncorrected distance va .\nacrysof   one - piece hydrophobic acrylic toric iols implantation shows satisfactory stability , acceptable clinical results , and is an exceptional option for correction of refractive astigmatism ."}
{"id": 82, "text": "song is a complex , learned motor skill that involves the precise coordination of vocal and respiratory musculature in order to produce highly stereotyped renditions of a memorized song model .\ntwo pathways contributed to this behavior are identified in the songbird forebrain : the motor pathway that is required throughout life for normal song production , and the anterior forebrain pathway ( afp ) which is necessary for song learning and plasticity [ 13 ] .\nhvc ( used as the proper name ) is the beginning nucleus of both pathways and projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( ra ) and afp .\nthe motor pathway is from hvc to ra , and then ra projects to brainstem nuclei controlling the vocal and respiratory muscles . during song , ra neurons in adult birds generate a highly stereotyped sequence of bursts [ 5 , 6 ] and also receive input from lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium ( lman ) , the output nucleus of afp .\nnotably , recordings from lman neurons projecting to ra revealed highly variable spiking activity across song renditions , suggesting that lman may act as a source of variability .\nthese results indicate that synaptic activity in lman - ra synaptic transmission is crucial to song plasticity [ 8 , 9 ] , but the detailed mechanism is unclear . it has been observed that ra received excitatory glutamatergic inputs from hvc and lman .\nthe former is mediated by a mixture of n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) and -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic - acid- ( ampa- ) type receptors [ 4 , 10 , 11 ] , and the latter is mediated almost exclusively by nmda - type receptors .\nlman - ra synaptic transmission is necessary for the variability of song in adult zebra finch , suggesting that the activity of nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses might induce the activity pattern change of ra neurons and change the bursts that control the vocal and respiratory muscles .\nthe control of gain , which refers to modulation of a neuron 's responsiveness to input , is critically important for normal sensory , cognitive , and motor functions [ 1215 ] .\ngain control is achieved through a divisive process and is observed as a change in the slope of the input - output relationship .\nsuch gain changes are frequently observed in the responses of cortical neurons and are thought to play an important role in neural computations .\nmodulations of gain have been observed in the enhancement of neural responses by attention [ 12 , 16 ] and can also be induced pharmacologically . in a neuron model ,\nnmda receptors caused such membrane potential fluctuations between a hyperpolarized down -

cell current clamp recording in adult male zebra finch slices .\nbrain slices were prepared from adult male zebra finches ( taeniopygia guttata ) ( > 90 days old ) obtained from commercial suppliers as previously described [ 19 , 20 ] .\nbrains were dissected into ice - cold , oxygenated ( 95% o2 and 5% co2 ) slice solution .\nslice solution consists of ( in mm ) sucrose 248 , kcl 5 , nahco3   28 , glucose 10 , mgso47h2o 1.3 , and nah2po4h2o 1.26 [ 21 , 22 ] .\ncoronal brain slices ( 250  m thick ) containing ra were cut with a vibrating microtome ( ma752 , usa ) and collected in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) that had been warmed to 37c and subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature .\nslices were allowed to recover in the holding chamber for at least 1.5  h and were equilibrated to room temperature before recordings were made .\nstandard acsf consists of ( in mm ) nacl 125 , nahco3 25 , nah2po4h2o 1.27 , kcl 2.5 , mgso47h2o 1.2 , cacl2   2.0 , and glucose 25 and was adjusted with sucrose to a final osmolarity of 350  mos . for recording ,\na slice was transferred to a submerge - type chamber where it was continuously exposed to acsf , saturated with 95% o2 and 5% co2 at room temperature ( 2226c ) at the rate of 2.0  ml / min .\nra and the surrounding tissues were distinguishable under bx51wi microscope connected with a dic - ir video camera ( olympus , japan ) . at high magnification ( 40x ) , ra neurons were visualized and the recordings were made from healthy cells .\nrecording pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass ( sutter instruments , usa ) using a flaming - brown puller ( model p-97 , sutter instruments , usa ) and were filled with the pipette solution containing ( in mm ) : k meso4   120 , nacl 5 , hepes 10 , egta 2 , mg - atp 2 , and na3-gtp 0.3 ( ph 7.3 - 7.4 , and 340  mos ) .\nthe recording pipettes , which had resistances ranging from 3 to 5  m , were positioned using an integrated motorized control system ( sutter instruments , usa ) .\nthe potential changes after application of nmda were corrected during the input - output stimulation protocols .\nthe series resistance ( rs ) , between 15  m and 30  m , was compensated using the bridge balance .\nall agents were applied by changing the bath perfusate from standard acsf to modified acsf in which various drugs were simply added . unless indicated otherwise ,\nthe clampfit 9.2 ( axon instruments , usa ) , mini 6.0 ( synaptosoft inc . , fort lee , nj , usa ) , and originpro 8.0 ( originlab , nothampton , ma , usa ) were used for analysis .\nevents with peak amplitude of 50  mv or higher and a rise time of about 0.5  ms were detected automatically , and the results were analyzed with origin pro 8.0 .\nthe steady - state spike rate was estimated by counting the number of spikes in 1 second , and the result was plotted versus the intensity of the injected current ( f - i relationship ) .\nthe slope of the f - i relationship ( referred to as gain ) was estimated by linear fitting .\nslope parameters were estimated separately for individual neurons and that figures 4 and 5 contain mean slope values averaged for the whole groups of neurons .\nthe amplitude of ahp was quantified as the difference between spike threshold and the lowest point of ahp . throughout\nmeans were compared using paired two - tailed student 's t - test or one - way anova followed by scheffe 's multiple comparison .\nstable whole - cell recordings were obtained in 160  ra projection neurons from 51 adult male zebra finches .\na neuron with the resting membrane potential < 50  mv and an overshooting action potential was considered viable .\nra projection neuron was identified by a larger soma , time - dependent inward rectifier induced by hyperpolarizing current and spontaneous regular spike firing or by depolarizing current pulses .\nthe input - output relationship was examined by injecting current pulses from 0 to 90  pa with an increment of 10  pa and an interval of 15  s , and they were lasted for 1  s. traces of action potentials in response to 1  s current steps of 10 , 50 , and 90  pa were shown in figure 1(a ) .\nthe slopes of the f - i relationships were 246.92  28.00  hz / na before nmda application and increased to 325.49  73.34 \nfurthermore , the input resistances were decreased by 20  m nmda in ra projection neurons ( p < 0.05 , n = 6 ) ( figure 2 ) .\nthe afterhyperpolarization ( ahp ) of action potential underlies the modulation of firing frequency . to test the effect of nmda on spike ahp\ncomparison of spike shape is shown in figure 3(a ) with 90  pa current injection before and after nmda application . in average\n, there was no significant change in the amplitude of ahp after nmda application ( p > 0.05 , n = 5 ) ( figure 3(b ) ) .\nthen we used 50  m dl - apv , a nmda receptor antagonist , to check the selectivity of nmda receptor , and we found that the slope of f - i was not changed by dl - apv alone ( p > 0.05 ) .\nthe slope was 255.78  66.69  hz / na and 269.34  56.96  hz / na ( p > 0.05 ) before and after application of 50  m dl - apv ( figure 4 ) , respectively .\nnmda increased the f - i slope 1.32 times ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , the gain modulation induced by nmda was completely abolished by dl - apv ( figure 4 ) .\nprevious studies reported that ra projection neurons received glutamatergic and gabaergic inputs [ 23 , 24 ] , which might increase background synaptic activities and modulate the gain of neurons [ 25 , 26 ] . to determine the effect of ampa receptor and gaba receptor on gain modulation by nmda , we examined the effects of nmda in the presence of cnqx , an antagonist for ionotropic glutamate ampa receptors , or / and bicuculline methiodide ( bic ) , a competitive antagonist of gabaa receptors , respectively .\nbic ( 10  m ) accelerated the depolarization by nmda application , but bic alone had little effect on the f - i slope . in the presence of bic ,\nthe mean initial slopes were 276.46  59.4 and 332.6  40.02  hz / na before and during application of nmda .\nthe f - i slope was increased from 1.32 to 1.39 in the presence of nmda and bic ( p > 0.05 ) ; that is , there is an increase of 105.30% over the nmda treatment ( figure 5 ; p > 0.05 , unpaired t - test ) .\ncnqx ( 10  m ) decreased the membrane potential and abolished the spontaneous spikes of ra projection neurons sometimes but did not affect the slope of f - i relationship . in the presence of cnqx ,\nnmda application hardly changed the f - i slope of ra projection neurons no matter whether bic was present or not ( figure 5 ; p > 0.05 ) .\nthese results indicated that the ampa receptor - dependent excitability played a crucial role in the gain modulation by nmda .\nthe slope was 0.97 or 1.11 in the presence of cnqx or cnqx and bic , respectively .\nthe gain induced by nmda was significantly decreased by cnqx ( p < 0.05 ) .\nin this study , we showed that nmda increased the gain of ra projection neurons in adult zebra finch .\nnmda - induced gain increase was limited to firing frequencies less than 40  hz . the effect of nmda on gain was mediated through nmda receptors and might involve synaptic activities . in songbirds , we found that nmda increased the slope of f - i relationship in ra projection neurons , which was completely blocked by dl - apv , a nmda receptor selective antagonist , suggesting that nmda increased the sensitivity of ra projection neurons .\nthe pharmacology of nmda receptors involved in gain modulation has been examined in mammals . in cat\nvisual cortex , nmda increased the gain of the contrast - response ( c - r ) curve of the neuron in layers ii / iii and v / vi . in mouse , the thalamocortical neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus play a key role in the generation of firing patterns through nmda receptors .\nthe neural activity in the afp of songbirds can direct moment - by - moment changes in the primary motor areas responsible for generating song .\nsinging - related activity in lman is more variable in pattern across repeated renditions during undirected song than directed song [ 28 , 29 ] .\nreported that the fundamental frequency of the syllable was shifted by stimulating the lman - ra pathway , which is mediated by nmda receptors .\nour results indicated that the activity of nmda receptor changed the sensitivity of ra projection neuron .\nra , as a premotor nucleus , occupies an important position in the song system , integrating information from both pathways .\nra projection neurons are responsible for transmitting song information to midbrain and brainstem vocal and respiratory structures . temporal pattern of spike bursts in ra projection neurons is associated with the timing of acoustic features of birdsong .\nprecise timing of individual spikes has a close relationship with stereotypic behavior , which suggests that the song is represented in ra by a temporal code [ 5 , 31 ] .\nthus , the modulation of nmda receptors in the activities of ra projection neurons could be very important for the plasticity of birdsong .\nprevious studies in slices demonstrated that nmda receptor achieves the nonlinear , multiplicative behavior seen in gain modulation by several mechanisms .\nmel presented results from compartmental modeling studies showing that dendrites containing nmda - type synaptic conductances and voltage - dependent na , k , and ca channels can impose nonlinear interactions between nearby synapses that give rise to approximate multiplications [ 32 , 33 ] . in thalamocortical cell of the rat and cat dlgn , nmda receptors contribute to the burst firing generated by the low - threshold ca potential and depend on the membrane potential range over which this type of firing occurs .\nin substantia nigra dopamine neurons , nmda receptor - mediated synaptic conductance generates transient high - frequency activity by rapidly but transiently overwhelming the conductance 's underlying action potential ahp and/or engaging postsynaptic voltage - dependent ion channels in a manner that overcomes the limiting effects of ahp .\nbut our results showed that there was no significant change in spike ahp after nmda application .\nso the gain induced by nmda in ra projection neurons may not be mainly modulated by the change of spike shape , but by synaptic activities .\nthe change in membrane potential has been shown to play an important role in the firing pattern regulation by nmda receptor , supporting the idea that depolarization acutely alters firing frequency .\nit has been shown that simple excitability or inhibition alone can induce a multiplicative gain change in the cortical neurons . in this model ,\none set of synaptic inputs provided purely excitatory drive to a target neuron , and another set of combined excitatory / inhibitory inputs ( or balanced inputs ) provided the modulation . in this setup , changing the firing rates of the balanced inputs produced an approximately multiplicative gain modulation of the response to the purely excitatory drive . here\n, blockade of the excitatory or inhibitory transmission alone had no effect on the f - i slope of ra projection neuron , implying that simple excitability or inhibition alone can not induce a multiplicative gain change .\nhowever , our results did not exclude a role of spontaneous synaptic activity on gain modulation in vitro , which , due to the loss of synapses in slice , was not sufficient to produce a significant change in gain .  \nampa receptors are required for the gain modulation in our study , because blocking excitatory transmission mediated by ampa receptors almost abolished the effect of nmda on gain modulation .\ntwo reasons might be involved : one is the two states of nmda - base mechanism due to the special anatomical structure of ra .\nra projection neurons receive inputs from two areas , hvc and lman . both are excitatory glutamatergic but have distinct postsynaptic properties .\nhvc - ra is largely mediated by ampa receptor , whereas lman - ra is almost completely mediated by nmda receptor .\nampa / nmda receptor composition of different neuronal pathways is the foundation of gating and gain modulation .\nnmda receptor - rich pathway can gate ampa - rich input and increase the gain of a neuron responding to the input of ampa - rich pathway .\nthe second is related to the intrinsic properties of nmda receptors , which are uniquely voltage dependent . except binding with neurotransmitter\nblockade of main excitatory inputs mediated by ampa receptor with cnqx hyperpolarized the membrane potential , which caused nmda receptors not activated .\ntherefore , the ampa receptor - mediated excitatory transmission is essential for the gain modulation induced by nmda .\nit is well known that the nmda receptor plays a critical role in many physiological and pathological processes , such as learning , memory , neurodegeneration , epilepsy , and ischemia .\nthe nmda receptor - mediated synaptic transmission satisfies the associative property of hebbian learning and in fact plays a critical role in its cellular model , long - term synaptic plasticity .\nnevertheless , pharmacological agents which block nmda receptors impair a variety of brain processes , suggesting that nmda receptor transmission also plays an important role beyond long - term memory and participates in shaping the dynamic activity of neural networks . in song system\n, the expression pattern of nmda receptor is related to the development of song learning [ 21 , 3740 ] .\nrecent results show that the nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses generates variability across different song renditions , thereby facilitating reinforced learning of songs . how nmda accomplishes this role is not clear .\nour results showed that nmda application increased the gain of ra projection neurons , in which ampa receptor was necessary .\nthe ampa receptor - mediated excitability is derived only from hvc [ 10 , 11 ] .\ntherefore , nmda receptor in lman - ra synapse might regulate hvc - ra synaptic transmission , which implicated that nmda receptor is more effective to modulate the syllable online .\nthese findings suggest a mechanism by which nmda receptor can selectively modulate behaviorally relevant excitatory inputs ."}

superficial femoral artery reconstitution ( fig .\nthe patient was not a candidate for percutaneous intervention , and was taken to the operating room for exploration .\nvisual inspection of the common femoral artery after exposure was significant for several patches of necrotic vessel wall .\ninitial attempt with thrombectomy was unsuccessful , as the fogarty catheter actually perforated the anterior wall at the areas of necrosis .\nthe patient ultimately received an extra - anatomic left external iliac to superficial femoral artery bypass using a nonreversed greater saphenous vein graft , as the external iliac was the closest available inflow that did not visually appear to be involved with the infection .\nintraoperative wound cultures were positive for pythium insidiosum and the patient was started on a combination of voriconazole , terbinafine , and amphotericin b. given his critical condition , an emergency investigational new drug request was drafted for permission to administer a p. insidiosum antigen vaccine available for compassionate use from the pan american veterinary laboratories .\nthe vaccine was given once daily in one - week intervals in conjunction with subcutaneously injected interferon gamma ( ifn- ) , for a total of four weeks .\nthree weeks after his initial surgery , the patient developed new sites of pain along the graft site and repeat imaging showed a 2.5  cm pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis to the external iliac artery with contrast extravasation ( fig .\nhe was taken to the operating room for an extra - anatomic left common iliac artery to the previous femoral popliteal bypass graft using a reverse saphenous vein graft .\nthe patient later developed a polymicrobial superinfection of his wounds , and his vascular repair continued to break down leading to increased ischemic pain .\nafter several multidisciplinary discussions with the family that all medical interventions were exhausted , and that even highly aggressive surgical measures including hip disarticulation or hemipelvectomy could not guarantee source control , conservative measures were initiated and ultimately , the patient expired .\nthis patient presented a major diagnostic challenge , and his disease process and subsequent management were previously unknown to our hospital .\nin retrospect , he presented with a classic case of vascular pythiosis , with an antecedent history of exposure to surface water and exam findings of vascular insufficiency , including pain out of proportion to exam , distal emboli , and an ischemic ulcer .\nthe correct infectious diagnosis was not made until 1 month after exposure , after a vascular bypass was already performed .\nindeed , in a large multi - institutional study from thailand with a total of 102 cases of pythiosis , 60 patients received a diagnosis of vascular pythiosis , and only the patients who had undergone amputation survived .\nfurther review of the literature for reports of vascular pythiosis demonstrated that the majority of patients were treated with amputation without any signs of recurrence , and were followed for 5 to 35 months post - operatively.4 , 6 , 8 , 9 in our case , complete source control was not achieved during the first operation since the common femoral artery and the proximal portion of the superficial femoral artery were oversewn and left in place , standard practice for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease .\nincomplete source control eventually led to development of a pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis and additional surgery .\nwhile the second repair was cited in previously uninvolved tissue planes , it did not protect against further infection , likely because p. insidiosum is known to invade through proteinase secretion .\nthe authors could find no reported cases of confirmed vascular pythiosis treated with limb - sparing procedures.2 , 7 , 11 , 12 medical therapy in the treatment of vascular pythiosis involves antifungal agents , immunotherapy , and iron chelation therapy .\nmuch of the difficulty in eradicating this organism stems from its complicated phylogenesis;2 , 6 , 14 it shares features with true fungi at the same time it is phylogenetically more closely related to algae and diatomeae . \n\np. insidiosum develops mycelium like fungi , but its cell walls do not contain chitin and its cytoplasmic membrane lacks ergosterol , both of which are important targets of traditional antifungal drugs . despite this , drugs that affect cellular permeability , including amphotericin b , terbinafine , and the azoles , have been used with some clinical success.2 , 15 more recently , immunotherapy has been used as an adjunct to surgery and antimycotics .\nimmunotherapy was first successfully used in humans in 1998 in a patient with a vascular p. insidiosum infection refractory to surgery and antifungals.2 , 16 a p. insidiosum vaccine delivered twice with a two - week interval resulted in a cure 1 year later .\ndata collected from clinical trials and other reports estimate vaccine efficacy to be 5560%.2 , 17 the proposed mechanism of action of the p. insidiosum vaccine is to shift host adaptive immune response from a predominantly t helper 2 ( th2 ) response to a t helper 1 ( th1 ) response.2 , 17 \n pythium exoantigens are typically processed by antigen presenting cells ( apcs ) and presented to nave cd4 helper t cells ( th0 ) .\nthis induces th0 cells to adopt a th2 phenotype secreting il-4 and il-5 , which trigger many downstream effects , including mast cell and eosinophil migration to the site of infection with subsequent degranulation , releasing inflammatory mediators and causing tissue damage .\nloss of tissue architecture then creates a more favorable environment for these pathogenic hyphae to take hold .\nconversion of a th2 to th1 response would favor secretion of ifn- and il-2 , leading to increased cytotoxic t lymphocyte recruitment and therefore , direct killing of p. insidiosum . in this case , the purpose of injecting ifn- subcutaneously was to augment a th1 response , and co - administration of gm - csf was to increase the efficiency of exoantigen presentation to apcs .\nanother treatment modality used to control this infection is iron chelation therapy . given the association between pythium infection in patients with hemoglobinopathies with a long - standing history of blood transfusions4 , 7 and the discovery of a ferrochelatase gene in p. insidiosum ,\nother research efforts have focused on elucidating the role of iron overload in p. insidiosum pathogenesis .\nthere is evidence that iron overload from transfusions contributes to derangements in host immunity by impairing lymphocyte function and altering phagocytosis , leading to a more susceptible state for infection6 , 19 and is in fact , a key virulence factor for the survival of p. insidiosum in the host .\ncorrecting iron overload has been cited as a treatment in infections common in thalassemia , and has also been used in pythiosis . in our patient ,\nin conclusion , this patient 's vascular p. insidiosum infection was refractory to optimized medical treatment , immunotherapy with cytokine injections , and surgery .\nattempted source control with limb salvage necessitating vascular bypass was unsuccessful in treating this case of vascular pythiosis .\nwritten informed consent was obtained from the patient 's guardian for publication of this case report and accompanying images .\na copy of the written consent is available for review by the editor -

values for determining whether genes were differentially expressed . rather than focusing solely on fold changes ,\nrosetta resolver uses error - model - based hypothesis tests , which account for both fold change and expression level .\nthree technical replicate hybridizations were averaged while ensuring that the technical replicates were of high repeatability . using the r function boxplot , raw and normalized log2 data from each sample were plotted but we did not include control and flagged probes .\nthis analysis not only helps finding hybridization with aberrant intensity distributions but also helps to confirm that the normalization of each replicate microarray has an appropriately centered distribution . for each sample\nthe scattered plots of raw and normalized log2 data were compared using the r function pairs .\npearson correlation tables were used to define the linear relationship of the two variables , raw and normalized data , in the scatter plots . for each technical repeat , we calculated correlation values for raw and normalized log2 intensities and we included in the calculation only probes with p - value of <  0.01 .\nscatter plots showed that technical replicates had high repeatability and all the correlation values were >  0.953 .\nour article , , emphasizes the differentially expressed genes of tissues that received different amounts of radiation ( i.e. 0 , 2 , or 12  gy ) , while herein we show the profiling of all the transcriptomic data resulting from these treatments .\nwe only used genes with |  fold change  |  >  1.5 and p - value  <  0.05 .\nwe input gene symbols into david bioinformatics , while throughout we used the default settings .\nthe threshold for significance was a benjamini - adjusted p - value  <  0.05 . based on our hypothesis , irradiated samples ( compared to non -

{"id": 85, "text": "adolescents in sub - saharan africa face high exposure to human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection . despite all efforts to prevent the disease , prevalence estimates in sub - saharan unaids ( i.e. , the joint united nations programme on hiv and aids ) priority countries range from 1.3 to 15.6  % among young women and 0.56.5  % among young men aged 1524  years ( unaids , 2011 ) .\nhigher prevalence estimates are associated with certain regions ( e.g. , eastern and southern africa ) and subpopulations ( e.g. , adolescent orphaned and/or married girls ; birdthistle et al . , 2008 ; operario , underhill , chuong , & cluver , 2011 ; pascoe et al . , 2010 ) .\nin addition , united nations children s fund ( unicef ) estimated there were 2  million adolescents aged 1019  years living with hiv globally in 2009 ( unicef , 2011 ) .\nkenya and zimbabwe were among countries with the highest numbers of infected adolescents with an estimated 136,000 ( prevalence estimate 1.5  % ) 1 and 104,000 ( prevalence estimate 3.1  % ) adolescents living with hiv , respectively ( unicef , 2011 ) .\nthe true measure of effectiveness for such interventions is reduction in hiv and other sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) .\nhowever , very few adolescent prevention studies have used biomarker data as outcomes ( michielsen et al . , 2010 ) because of concerns about the difficulties in collecting these data in resource poor settings ( jukes , simmons , & bundy , 2008 ) , even when power analyses suggest that moderate intervention effects could be detected .\nbehavioral prevention scientists have instead relied on self - reported sexual behavior , which is subject to social desirability bias and likely to differ between study arms ( cowan & pettifor , 2009 ; kirby , obasi , & laris , 2006 ) .\nwidespread access to testing and treatment facilitated by the president s emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ; http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/global-health/hiv-and-aids ) have greatly enhanced opportunities to successfully incorporate biomarker procedures into adolescent hiv prevention research designs , since infected individuals identified through testing offered by studies may access free or subsidized hiv treatment and care ( stringer et al . , 2006 ; wools - kaloustian et al . , 2006 , 2009 )\nmoreover , including biomarker outcomes can greatly improve the credibility and legitimacy of hiv prevention research . to address the issue of feasibility , we present two case studies of prevention trials with biomarker data collection among adolescents in kenya and zimbabwe .\ntogether these studies provide a valuable opportunity to examine the ethical and practical challenges of biomarker procedures within hiv prevention intervention clinical trials in developing countries .\nspecifically , we describe the challenges faced by investigators in the two cases in developing and implementing ethical procedures for informed consent , biomarker testing , and disclosure of test results .\nwe also present the practical challenges of collecting biological samples in resource - limited countries and compare sample collection by blood spots relative to venipuncture .\nin addition , we examine difficulties with analyzing biological samples when the performance of assays in certain populations is unclear .\nwe also provide specific suggestions for further research and development in collecting and analyzing biomarker data for adolescent prevention research .\nthe primary goal of hiv prevention among adolescents ( ages 1019  years ) is to reduce new infections and related sexual risk factors [ world health organization ( who ) , 2006 ) .\nalthough the hiv prevalence of adolescents ages 15 and older is monitored through demographic and health surveys ( dhs)2 in most sub - saharan africa countries , little is known about the prevalence of hiv in adolescents under 15  years .\nmoreover , these adolescents are rarely tested for hiv in clinical settings unless they present in poor health or with recurrent infections ( ferrand et al . , 2009 ) .\nalthough a small number of recent randomized controlled trials have used biomarkers ( baird , mcintosh , & ozler , 2010 ; cowan et al .\n; pronyk et al . , 2006 ; ross et al . , 2007 ) ,\nmost adolescent hiv prevention studies have relied on changes in self - reported sexual behavior to assess intervention effectiveness ( see reviews : cowan & pettifor , 2009 ; michielsen et al . ,\n2010 ) , with audio computer - assisted self - interviews intended to improve veracity ( mensch , erulkar , & hewett , 2003 ) .\nhowever , biomarker comparisons have suggested that self - reported measures have low validity ( cowan et al . , 2002 ; gavin et al . , 2006 ; mensch , hewett , gregory , & helleringer , 2008 ; palen et al . , 2008 ; plummer et al . , 2004 ) .\nfor example , in one study , only one of 16 youth with hiv admitted to ever having sex , and four of the 16 also had either chlamydia or gonorrhea ( cowan et al . , 2002 ) .\ninclusion of a highly prevalent and reliable biomarker of sexual activity in conjunction with self - reported sexual behavior can help to improve reliability of this outcome measure .\nhiv infection is not the most useful biomarker of adolescent sexual activity by itself because of the relatively low prevalence among younger adolescents and the potential for transmission through perinatal and non - sexual blood - borne routes ( amornkul et al .\n, 2009 ; ferrand et al . , 2009 ; stover , walker , grassly , & marston , 2006 ) .\nherpes simplex virus type 2 ( hsv-2 ) , the primary cause of genital herpes , is a commonly used biomarker of sexual activity because the presence of hsv-2 antibodies is highly associated with past sexual behavior ( tobian et al . , 2009 ; van de laar et al . , 1998 ) .\nin contrast to other stis such as chlamydia , gonorrhea , syphilis and trichomoniasis , infection with hsv-2 is life - long , and , once established , there is currently no treatment to eliminate it ( geretti , 2006 ; gupta , warren , & wald , 2008 ) .\nhsv-2 prevalence in the adult general population in sub - saharan africa is high , ranging from 30 to 80  % in women and from 10 to 50  % in men , as assessed by detection of hsv-2 antibodies [ amornkul et al . , 2009 ;\n, 2005 ; munjoma et al . , 2010 ; national aids & sti control programme ( nascop ) , republic of kenya , 2009 ; tobian et al . , 2009 ; weiss , 2004 ] .\nprevalence estimates for adolescents are only available through community - based studies and are lower .\none study in zimbabwe among adolescent females aged 1519  years reported that 12  % of participants tested positive for hsv-2 ( birdthistle et al .\na study in western kenya found hsv-2 prevalence to be 9  % for females and 4  % for males aged 1314 , and 28  % for females and 17  % for males aged 1519  years ( amornkul et al . , 2009 ) .\nanother study conducted in zimbabwe among adolescents whose mean age was 15  years reported a prevalence estimate of 0.2  % , suggesting a later stage of sexual debut ( cowan et al .\n2012 ) evaluated the use of hsv-2 as a biomarker of sexual debut among young people aged 1024  years . following a comprehensive review of the literature\n, the authors concluded that the use of hsv-2 as a biomarker for sexual debut is limited because of its low transmissibility and the fact that not all potential sexual partners are infected with the virus .\nbuilding on these findings , our study describes the challenges of collecting hiv and hsv-2 biological data as biomarkers for sexual activity among sub - saharan african youth in prevention trials .\nwe present two clinical trial case studies to examine important issues related to adolescent biomarker data collection in two clinical trials in kenya and zimbabwe ( hallfors et al . ,\nboth studies were school - based , cluster randomized trials testing school support ( including payment of school tuition and school uniforms ) as a structural hiv prevention intervention for adolescent orphans . in both studies , we collected blood samples from participants for hiv and hsv-2 testing , but they differed as follows : we collected samples by venipuncture with results disclosed to participants and their guardians in kenya , whereas in zimbabwe , we collected samples by finger pricks for dried blood spots ( dbs ) and results were not disclosed . the kenya sample ( n  =  837 ) comprised young adolescent male ( 52  % ) and female ( 48  % ) orphans in grades 7 ( 61  % ) and 8 ( 39  % ) enrolled in school in siaya district , nyanza province .\ntheir mean age was 14.9 ( sd 1.5 ; range 1121  years ) ; 22  % reported ever having had sex . among girls ,\nhiv and hsv-2 prevalence was 1  % ( n  =  10 ) and 3  % ( n  =  28 ) , respectively . among those with positive hiv or hsv-2 test results , 70  % ( n  =  7 ) and 64  % ( n  =  18 ) , respectively , reported never having had sex .\nthe original sample for the zimbabwe study was orphan 6th grade girls ( n  =  328 ) in manicaland province primary schools ; surveys were administered annually during 20072010 ( hallfors et al . , 2011 ) .\nafter securing a project renewal grant , we collected biomarker specimens and a final survey in march through june 2012 , when most participants were 1617  years old . from the original sample , we located 287 ( 88  % ) for the 2012 survey .\ntwenty - three percent reported ever having sex ; 18  % had ever been married and/or pregnant .\nhiv and hsv-2 prevalence was 4  % ( n  =  12 ) and 6  % ( n  =  16 ) , respectively . among those with positive hiv or hsv-2 test results , 50  % ( n  =  6 ) and 44  % ( n  =  7 ) , respectively , reported never having had sex .\nalthough the protection of adult participants in hiv prevention research is well developed ( national institute of mental health collaborative hiv / std prevention trial group , 2007 ) , we found that clear guidance regarding hiv and other sti testing and disclosure is lacking for children and adolescents .\nas an example , our two clinical trials were peer - reviewed by two different nih scientific review panels ; one set of reviewers thought that it was an ethical imperative to disclose hsv-2 as well as hiv results to adolescents , whereas the other was concerned that disclosure of biomarker results might lead to stigma and abuse .\nthese divergent opinions led to discrepant protocols for disclosure , with one trial disclosing and the other not disclosing test results to participants .\nwe used the national hiv testing and counseling ( htc ) guidelines [ central statistical office ( cso ) & macro international inc .\n, 2007 ; nascop , republic of kenya , 2008 ] for hiv in both countries .\ngiven the lack of national guidelines for adolescent sti testing in kenya [ ministry of health ( moh ) , republic of kenya , 2006 ) , we developed a protocol in conjunction with the siaya district aids and std control office that closely followed hiv guidelines .\nstudy protocols were reviewed and approved by irbs in the us , kenya and zimbabwe .\nthe kenya study was approved by the ministry of education and siaya district education office ; school head teachers identified orphans and organized meetings in which moi university research collaborators and a district education officer explained the study to students and their caregivers . caregivers and students\nwe invited a total of 923 orphans in grades 7 and 8 in 2011 to participate ; 849 ( 92  % ) consented and 837 ( 91  % ) completed both the student survey and biomarker testing .\nfollowing national guidelines , we required kenya study participants under age 18 to have an adult guardian accompany them for hiv rapid testing ( nascop , republic of kenya , 2008 ) . in some instances , however , the guardian was not available because of work , other commitments , or illness .\nin such cases we permitted a relative , teacher or neighbor to stand - in for the guardian if they had a note from the guardian or if research staff were able to speak with the guardian by phone .\ngiven the sensitive nature of hiv testing , the senior counselor interviewed all unclear or undocumented cases to determine whether or not to proceed with specimen collection and htc .\nwe visited clinics several times to give participants the opportunity to return for testing with their guardian or authorized proxy .\nalthough not required , all participants ages 18 and older were accompanied by an adult for support in case of a positive hiv test result . in accordance with national guidelines\n, we gave referrals to publicly funded hiv care and treatment centers to all adolescents with positive hiv test results , while hiv negative participants were counseled on risk reduction ( nascop , republic of kenya , 2008 ) .\nwe disclosed results to both guardians and participants if the latter were under age 18 and to the participants alone if they were 18  years old according to the study protocol . in zimbabwe , with permission from the provincial education officer , the consortium principal investigator and a research associate held meetings at study schools to explain the continuing study to parents / guardians , participants , and key school staff .\nwe obtained written parent / guardian consent and participant assent for continued voluntary participation in the study , including separate checkbox consent for survey and blood sample collection .\nguardians raised few concerns , although they did ask why we were not disclosing test results .\nparticipants who were married or 18  years or older provided their own consent . in deference to local cultural norms and to prevent potential spousal abuse , we prepared a second consent form for husbands to provide consent for their wives participation .\nmost of the wives gave their own consent for the survey and did not ask their husbands for consent . in four cases ,\nthe husband signed a consent form and in five additional cases , the husband refused and the wife did not take the survey . although asking husbands for permission for their wives study participation is not consistent with us culture , it appears to be a useful protocol accommodation for some young wives in rural zimbabwe .\nwe consistently relied on local researchers and key informants to make such culturally sensitive decisions .\nafter 4  months , we found 88  % of the original sample who consented to the survey ; 85  % consented to blood specimen collection .\nof those not surveyed , two participants had died in childbirth , 2  % refused , and approximately 10  % of the sample could not be found . of those not consenting to blood specimen collection ( n  =  8) , six were married and refused for religious reasons or husband s objection .\ntwo were consented for the survey by school officials who refused to provide additional consent for the blood collection , and no guardian was available to give permission .\nhiv testing is technically far more advanced for widespread use in sub - saharan africa than hsv-2 testing .\nrapid hiv antibody tests are now widely used and accepted ( moh , republic of kenya , 2006 ) , and sequential algorithms for retesting have been adopted in kenya and zimbabwe for rapid testing ( cso & macro international inc . , 2007 ; nascop , republic of kenya , 2008 ; who , 2004 ) .\nrapid hiv tests meet high performance standards , sample collection procedures are simple , tests are easy to perform , and interpretation of test results is reasonably clear . in contrast , hsv-2 serologic testing presents some important challenges .\nalthough a number of hsv-2 type - specific serologic tests are available , only a limited number have been tested among sub - saharan african populations .\nthese include the herpeselect hsv-2 enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ; focus diagnostics , cypress , ca ) and kalon hsv-2 elisa ( kalon biological ltd . , guildford , uk ; biraro , mayaud , morrow , grosskurth , & weiss , 2011 ) .\nthese tests require skilled laboratory staff , specialized equipment , and a constant source of electricity .\nthey are appropriate for use with large batches of samples as in sentinel surveys and are inexpensive , costing about $ 3 per test .\nalthough the literature reports variable performance of these tests with respect to sensitivity and specificity in sub - saharan populations , kalon is often found to be superior to focus herpeselect ( see biraro et al . , 2011 for a review of the performance of hsv-2 tests in sub - saharan africa ;\n2008 ; ngayo , friedrich , holmes , bukusi , & morrow , 2010 ; smith et al . , 2009 ; van dyck et al . , 2004 ) .\nwhen using the manufacturer s instructions ( index cutoff value  =  1.1 for both tests ) , kalon tends to have lower sensitivity but higher specificity than focus herpeselect ( delany - moretlwe et al .\n, 2010 ; gamiel et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al . , 2010 ; smith et al . , 2009 ; van dyck et al . ,\nthe low specificity of focus herpeselect is particularly problematic when disclosing results to research participants because of an unacceptably high rate of false positives when prevalence is low ( gamiel et al . , 2008 ; mark et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al\n, 2010 ; van dyck et al . , 2004 ) . increasing the assay cut - off values is one strategy for improving the performance of both the kalon and focus herpeselect tests .\na number of studies have shown that increasing the cut - off value for focus herpeselect to 3.5 increases specificity , although sensitivity is necessarily reduced ( delany - moretlwe et al . , 2010 ; smith et al . ,\nother studies similarly improved performance at cut - off values of 3.2 and 3.3 ( delany - moretlwe et al . , 2010 ; gamiel et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al . ,\nalthough findings are mixed , increasing the cut - off value for the kalon test to 1.5 has also been shown to increase specificity , with an attendant reduction in sensitivity ( gamiel et al . , 2008 ; ngayo et al .\nin our studies , the kenya laboratory used the kalon assay , and the zimbabwe laboratory used the focus test . at the time of our studies , neither assay had been validated for dbs by the manufacturer in african populations .\nthe efficiency of dbs for hsv-2 testing with each assay must be evaluated in specific populations prior to use ( hogrefe , ernst , & su , 2002 ) . because the kalon test had not been validated for hsv-2 testing with dbs samples , specimens in the kenya study were obtained by venipuncture .\nthe zimbabwe laboratory had validated the focus test with dbs ( mudzori & mutsogoro , 2006 ) . in both studies\n, we used a modified algorithm to interpret results : samples with initial index values < 0.9 were reported as negative and no further testing was conducted .\nsamples with initial index values > 2.5 were defined as high positive and were reported as positive without additional testing .\nsamples with initial index values from 1.5 to 2.5 were considered low positive , and those with initial index values between 0.9 and 1.5 were considered equivocal ; all low positives and equivocals were retested in duplicate . if both retest results had index values > 1.5 , the final result was reported as positive . if both retest results were < 0.9 , the final result was negative .\nif retest results were equivocal ( 0.91.5 ) or discordant , the final result was indeterminate .\nalthough test performance was improved by increasing the cut - off and expanding the range of results for repeat testing , the performance characteristics of tests to detect antibodies to hsv-2 are imperfect . based on a recent systematic review of hsv-2 antibody test performance in sub - saharan africa ( biraro et al . , 2011 ) , sensitivity for the kalon test used in kenya was estimated at 94  % and specificity at 92  % with the higher cut - off value of 1.5 .\nthe predictive values of all diagnostic tests are strongly influenced by the prevalence of infection in the population , and in low prevalence situations , even a very good test will have a poor positive predictive value ( ppv ) . using the sensitivity and specificity values for the kalon test under the testing conditions employed in our kenya study ,\nthe ppv was estimated at 26  % with a 3  % hsv-2 prevalence .\nthat is , we can be confident that about one in four participants with positive test results truly had hsv-2 antibodies present in their blood sample ; however , as many as three in four could have had a false positive test result .\nin kenya , we conducted sample collection and htc primarily in local public health facilities near the schools . eighteen facilities participated .\nin two sites , with permission from the school headmasters and district education officer , we collected blood samples and conducted htc at the school .\nvenipuncture was conducted by six skilled phlebotomists trained in htc . to avoid obtaining two separate blood specimens ( finger prick for rapid hiv testing and venipuncture for hsv-2 testing )\nthe process , including counseling , blood draw , hiv testing , disclosure of results took on average 20  min .\nthe process was longer for participants with discordant results who needed a tie - breaker test and for participants with hiv positive results .\nwe offered all participants and their guardians a snack either before or after specimen collection .\nwe stored blood samples for hsv-2 testing in labeled vacutainer tubes in a cooler box without ice and transported them to a local laboratory within 24  h for serum processing .\nsera were stored at the local laboratory in a freezer at 20  c until transport on ice weekly to the hsv-2 testing laboratory .\nthe logistics of specimen collection , processing and transport for this study were challenging but feasible . in comparison ,\nwe did not require guardians to be present because hiv results were not provided to participants .\nsampling and dbs preparation were much less obvious to others nearby , helping to safeguard participant privacy and reduce concerns about witchcraft or other conspiracy theories regarding hiv / aids and blood , which circulate in sub - saharan african communities ( tenkorang , gyimah , maticka - tyndale , & adjei , 2011 ) .\nblood from the finger prick was dropped on five circles on a dbs filter card labeled with the participant s study i d .\nsome participants may have been dehydrated or not very well nourished , making it difficult to fill all circles , but adequate samples were collected from all participants .\nspecimens were dried , stored with a desiccant , and transported to the testing lab at ambient temperatures .\ndbs samples are easy to store and transport and require no processing or refrigeration ( see table  1 for a summary of the study procedures).table  1comparison of biomarker testing procedures in two research studieskenyazimbabweethical considerationswritten guardian consent if < 18/adolescent assentwritten guardian consent / adolescent assentresults disclosed to guardian and adolescentno results disclosedreferrals for carenot applicablecollecting and analyzing biological samples  methodvenipuncturedried blood spot  hiv testrapid testrapid test  hsv testkalon elisafocus elisafeasibility of collection methods  time20  min3  min  temperature for specimen transportcooler with no iceambienttesting costsreference labreference lab  bench fee , supplies , storage , labor us$ 5,784bench fee , supplies , labor us$ 8,000field site lab  sample processing , labor , supplies , storage us$ 3,611additional fee us$ 480  other supplies us$ 100  transportation us$ 375  total us$ 9,919total us$ 8,480 \n elisa enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay comparison of biomarker testing procedures in two research studies \n elisa enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay\ngiven the experience we have described , we conclude that it is feasible to obtain hiv and hsv-2 biomarker data for adolescent hiv prevention intervention studies . in particular\nthe us pepfar program has accomplished considerable staff training in sub - saharan africa ; it has also stimulated the development of well - equipped laboratories , as well as useful tools for testing and protocols for improving test sensitivity , specificity , and cost ( stringer et al . , 2006 ) .\nin addition , it has stimulated the development of national guidelines ( particularly for adults ) for the disclosure of results . for hiv\nincorporation of hsv-2 serology results poses considerable challenges , particularly if results are disclosed to participants .\nbased on our experience , there are two reasons why we do not recommend disclosing hsv-2 serology results to adolescent human subjects in sub - saharan africa .\nfirst , in populations with low or moderate prevalence of infection , as might be expected for adolescents , the potential for false positive test results is substantial in combination with relatively minor imperfections in test specificity .\nhsv-2 infection is often a silent disease , insofar as only 1025  % of people with antibodies for the condition are aware that they have genital herpes ( fleming et al . , 1997\n; leone , fleming , gilsenan , li , & justus , 2004 ; sizemore , lakeman , whitley , hughes , & hook , 2006 ) .\nadolescents without symptoms may deny ever having had sexual intercourse3 , further complicating the clinical picture and raising concerns about false positives with the potential for psychological and social harm related to participation in the study .\nsecond , local departments of health and sti authorities in sub - saharan african countries were much less familiar with hsv-2 pathology and treatment than with hiv and some other stis . even in cases where subjects acknowledge sexual exposure or genital herpes symptoms , local health clinics may not be prepared to provide appropriate treatment or care . given these vexing problems , the wisdom of disclosing hsv-2 results to adolescents after testing within a clinical prevention trial is questionable . in particular , decisions about whether to inform adolescent participants in prevention trials about hsv-2 test results should be made only after prevalence data are available and the predictive values of the test can be accurately assessed . in light of the feedback from the nih study section that raised concerns about possible stigma and abuse of hiv - positive participants in zimbabwe , as well as our own concerns ,\nwe recommend that more research be conducted to study the consequences of disclosure to adolescents in sub - saharan africa .\na review of the literature indicates that sub - saharan adolescent prevention studies with biomarker outcomes have taken a variety of approaches to disclosure . in some studies , counselors disclosed participants hiv results immediately after rapid testing ( baird , garfein , mcintosh , & ozler , 2012 ; dalal et al . , 2012 ; medley et al . , 2012 ) .\nin other studies , participants could choose to receive their results after testing , either immediately or a few weeks later ( amornkul et al .\n, 2009 ; jewkes et al . , 2006 ; ross et al . , 2007 ) .\nin still other studies , the research did not provide test results but voluntary counseling and testing ( vct ) was made freely available for study participants ( birdthistle et al .\nnone of these studies , however , examined whether adolescents experienced any untoward outcomes with testing and disclosure , whether hiv positive youth enrolled in care or took steps to prevent transmission , whether hiv negative youth benefited from prevention counseling and engaged in subsequent testing , or if adolescents and their guardians felt it was appropriate to learn their status in the context of a research study . from our kenya study , the problem of stigma did not appear to be a major obstacle to adolescent testing and disclosure in our study area .\nperhaps this is because hiv prevalence is among the highest in the country , and few families have been unaffected by hiv / aids .\nmoreover , high hiv prevalence has drawn research , education , and hiv counseling and testing campaigns to the area .\nfor example , in our kenya clinical trial , more than 50  % of participants ( all in grade 7 and 8) reported that they had previously been tested for hiv , mostly through a home - based testing initiative of the kenya medical research institute ( kemri ) and us centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) .\nalthough our study provided hiv test results to youth , we relied on phlebotomist / nurse counselors to refer youth and their guardians for care , following national guidelines .\nthe onus of making contact with the clinic was left up to the individual and was not tracked by the system of care ; and follow up to make sure that hiv positive youth accessed care was well beyond the scope of our study . since it is unknown whether youth experience significant mental trauma and social prejudice , and whether they actually engage in the system of care , we recommend that further research be conducted to examine the perceptions and behaviors of youth  and particularly newly diagnosed youth  after disclosure of their test results to ascertain the consequences of this aspect of research participation and whether it can be improved .\nthis is particularly important for adolescents , since results are disclosed in the presence of their guardian .\nregarding procedures for collecting biomarkers , we conclude that finger - sticks and dbs are overwhelmingly superior to venipuncture in sample collection efficiency and reduced burden on participants and community institutions .\nmanufacturer validations of dbs for hsv-2 are urgently needed , however , for this procedure to be more widely accessible to researchers . because blood collection for dbs is minimally invasive , this procedure has excellent potential for widespread acceptability and consequent high participation in school and community research sites .\nin addition , rapid hiv testing in sub - saharan africa is typically conducted by finger prick , making this the preferred way for trained african health workers and counselors to participate in research data collection ( who , 2004 ) .\ngiven the complex decisions required for biomarkers , we recommend that behavioral prevention scientists interested in using biomarker data collaborate from the early planning stages with biomedical scientists who have expert knowledge in hsv-2 , as well as hiv , laboratory tests and testing procedures .\nwe found that team members with such expertise provide valuable assistance in selecting qualified in - country laboratories , developing appropriate budgets , protocols , quality assurance and algorithms for interpreting results , and helping research staff to bridge communication with in - country laboratory staff .\nfurther , we recommend that hsv-2 test kit manufacturers determine optimal cut - off standards for sub - saharan populations , and that researchers who conduct hsv-2 testing explicitly define the testing cutoffs they use in publications .\nthere is now a substantial literature documenting validity problems when using manufacturers cutoffs with african populations potentially inflating prevalence findings ( gamiel et al . , 2008 ;

arterial thrombolysis and oral administration of aspirin .\nbut , for pediatric stroke patient , there is no guideline of this useful treatment method either14 ) . to the best of our knowledge ,\nthe first report about the benefits of decompressive hemicraniectomy in pediatric patient was described by carter et al.3 ) at 1997 . however , from this time , only a few report deals with decompressive craniectomy for pediatric patient were published . in adult acute stroke patient group , the effect of decompressive craniectomy also has been established .\nvahedi et al.21 ) reported that in a meta - analysis combining the data of 93 subjects from three small , randomized , controlled trials , mortality for conservative management in adult ischemic stroke patients with early brain edema was 71% as compared with 22% for decompressive surgical intervention . nowadays\n, some case reports and review has been published favorable outcome after decompressive surgery in childhood acute stroke2,17 ) .\nit is not often however in some article , decompressive craniotomy have been regarded as emerging procedure can save life , for pediatric stroke patient6,11 ) , even guideline for craniectomy was introduced11 ) . in point of fact\nwidely accepted proper operation timing is immediately after signs of herniation and a midline shift which was defined as a more than equals 5-mm contralateral shift of the midline structures on the preoperative cranial ct scan on septum pellucidum level , compressed basal cisterns , or uncal herniation -- had to be present on cranial ct had been noted .\nrecent studies in adult stroke group have shown that this procedure not only reduces mortality but also improves neurological functional outcome .\nthis procedure may be life - saving if done early in cases of impending herniation , is associated with good outcomes in pediatric stroke patients9,11 ) .\nmaybe if operation was performed earlier , it may minimize the vicious circle of brain swelling , increased icp , ischemia , and infarction12 ) . in our series , four toddlers and one pre - school girl with refractory high icp due to non - traumatic , ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke\nfour patient received pcpcs score of 2 ( mild disability ) and only one received that of 3 ( moderate disability ) after 3 years later post operation .\nthese results showed that decompressive craniectomy can not only play a rescuer therapeutic role but also guaranty acceptable clinical outcome in the treatment regimen in non - traumatic , refractory high icp in pediatric field . in some articles , decompressive\naghakhani et al.2 ) report that decompressive craniectomy was performed in pediatric patient with malignant intracranial hypertension due to infectious encephalitis . in adult patient group , there had been not infrequently reported that malignant intracranial hypertension due to encephalitis treated with decompressive craniectomy .\nnow , even in case of pediatric patient with infectious disease in central nerve system , decompressive craniectomy could be considered as life - saving - treatment options .\ngordon et al.7 ) report that pediatric stroke can affect not only patient itself , but also his or her whole family .\nover half of stroke survivors have suffer from decrease in quality of life and affects the entire family , and relates to both neurological deficits and psychosocial factors11 ) .\nhence , if all medical treatment is fail to drop the icp in non - traumatic pediatric acute stroke patient , without hesitation , a decompressive craniectomy could be regarded as next step treatment option .\nin this study , we describes the young pediatric patients have undergone decompressivehemicraniectomy for a non - traumatic acute hemispheric stroke .\nit also shows that decompressive hemicraniectomy can be lifesaving and can besafely performed in toddler and pre - school children . and young children can get a survival and relatively independence and family satisfaction.decompressive hemicraniectomy\nshould be considered as an alternative therapy for patients with life - threatening brains welling refractory to medical management ."}

prc was observed with the combination , which was related to the antiproteinuric effect , whereas hs - pra was reduced 50% compared with the reduction with placebo .\nas opposed to the aliskiren in the evaluation of proteinuria in diabetes ( avoid ) study ( 5 ) , which showed an additional 20% albuminuria reduction after 24 weeks of treatment with aliskiren compared with placebo added to the maximal recommended dose of losartan and optimal antihypertensive therapy , this is the first study with a head - to - head comparison between aliskiren and irbesartan treatment .\nno other antihypertensive drugs except for furosemide were allowed in our study , thereby offering a clearer picture of the effect of the two compounds used , compared with the avoid study , in which aliskiren was combined with losartan and a mixture of other antihypertensive drugs .\nthis study is different with regard to patient population , with a lower mean baseline uaer compared with that in the avoid study .\nin addition , we assessed the effect of renin inhibition on gfr , a measurement that is more precise than the estimated gfr used in the avoid study .\nraas blockade is believed to reduce proteinuria through several different mechanisms : the mean transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference , the glomerular surface area , and the size and charge selectivity of the glomerular filter . in diabetic nephropathy several of these variables\nare abnormal , and raas blockade has been demonstrated to normalize directly measured or estimated glomerular hydraulic pressure ( 79 ) , to reduce the shunt - like defects in the membrane , at least in part ( 10 ) , and to restore the charge - selectivity properties of the glomerular membrane ( 11 ) .\naliskiren is thought to reduce albuminuria by the same mechanism as during treatment with ace inhibitors or arbs .\nrecently , fisher et al . ( 12 ) have shown that aliskiren treatment increases renal plasma flow to a larger extent than the ace inhibitor captopril .\nthe increase in renal plasma flow may be a response to angiotensin at1 receptor  dependent reduction of the vascular tone in the efferent arteriole . reduced vascular tone in the efferent glomerular arteriole\ncould be responsible for the decrease in intraglomerular pressure , leading to the reduction in albuminuria and gfr as demonstrated in our study .\nalthough the combination reduced gfr up to 12 ml / min ( 95% ci 15.97.4 ) , we interpreted this as an reversible hemodynamic change and not as an indication of nephrotoxicity ( 13 ) .\nin fact , it has been shown that an early hemodynamic reduction in gfr can translate into long - term renoprotection ( 13 ) .\nwhen the albuminuria reduction was adjusted during combination treatment for changes in gfr ( fractional clearance ) , it was 11% higher than during irbesartan treatment , a nonsignificant change that was possibly due to a small sample number .\nsigns of more effective raas blockade were evident from the synergistic effect of combination treatment on ir - prc .\nthis conclusion is based on the fact that renin release into plasma is proportional to the interruption of the permanent negative feedback loop of ang ii on renin secretion ( 14 ) . combining aliskiren with\nirbesartan provided a 12-fold increase in ir - prc , but still with a 50% reduction in hs - pra compared with changes during the placebo period .\nthis renin rise could reflect a high degree of intrarenal raas blockade during combination treatment as compared with that for the monotherapies , as has been suggested in nondiabetic patients ( 15 ) .\nthe reductions in albuminuria in our study were correlated with the rise in ir - prc , supporting the concept of increased intrarenal raas blockade underlying the additional effects observed during combination treatment .\ncompared with other studies of dual raas blockade , the rise in ir - prc is higher in dual raas blockade using aliskiren than in dual raas blockade with an ace inhibitor and an arb ( 5,16,17 ) . such marked increases in renin during aliskiren treatment have been noted before ( 18 ) .\napart from reflecting more complete ( intrarenal ) raas blockade , they may also be due to the detection of prorenin as renin ( 19 ) or a change in the renin half - life after its binding to aliskiren ( 20 ) .\npra was measured both by a conventional method and by a new high - sensitivity assay ( hs - pra ) , which is independent of endogenous substrate variation ( 21 ) . because high pra levels confer the risk of cardiovascular disease ( 22 ) , it will be interesting to evaluate long - term effects of direct renin inhibition in the ongoing aliskiren trial in type 2 diabetes using cardio - renal endpoints ( altitude ) , providing data on hard cardiovascular and renal end points ( 23 ) .\nthe antihypertensive effect of aliskiren was smaller than that found in previous larger studies ( 16 ) , although the office blood pressure reduction did not differ from that caused by irbesartan .\nthe ongoing telmisartan alone and in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial ( ontarget ) investigators ( 24 ) concluded that in a cardiovascular risk population , dual raas blockade with the arb telmisartan and the ace inhibitor ramipril is equivalent in reducing cardiovascular events compared with either as monotherapy , although with more frequent adverse events , including renal adverse events .\nalmost 3,000 of the participating 25,260 patients had microalbuminuria at baseline , and substudies of albuminuria effects are expected .\nseveral short - term studies using dual raas blockade in diabetic nephropathy have shown promising antiproteinuric effects , as reviewed by rossing ( 17 ) , but the largest study so far ( 25 ) did not show additional benefits of a combination of ramipril and irbesartan , compared with ramipril monotherapy , in terms of albuminuria reduction after 20 weeks .\nthe size was , however , sufficient to demonstrate the likely beneficial effect of combination therapy with aliskiren and irbesartan , although we evaluated a surrogate end point .\nin addition , the discrepancy between 24 h and office blood pressure readings complicates interpretation of the results .\nstudies evaluating mortality and morbidity are ongoing and will provide further information on dual raas blockade with aliskiren . in summary , we demonstrate an antiproteinuric effect of dual raas blockade with aliskiren and irbesartan in combination compared with either treatment alone in patients with type 2 diabetes , hypertension , and albuminuria .\nthe synergistic effect on ir - prc illustrates a higher degree of intrarenal raas blockade during combination treatment ."}

surface \n\n interactions .\nmaterial surface \n properties have been studied intensively , but \n still lack from reliable data about cytocompatibility .\nespecially , the \n superordinate principles of cellular responses to \n surfaces with a defined \n topography are not well known and poorly understood . \n because many variables \n influence cellular interactions to surface structures , \n it is difficult to draw \n conclusions and formulate general principles for \n nano- and microstructured \n surfaces .\nthis review summarizes recent data of effects by nano- and \n microstructured biomaterials and particles in vitro designed for \n orthopaedic application to get a solid \n framework outlining the critical interactions that govern the \n cytocompatibility . \n because biomaterials in orthopaedics are predominantly \n applied on bone , this review is focussed on \n the interactions of osteoblasts \n  and bone - marrow - derived \n cells with structured biomaterials .\nosteoblasts and osteoclasts are mainly \n responsible for the osteointegration of \n nanostructured biomaterials in orthopaedics . \n\nosteoblasts derive from \n mesenchymal progenitor cells which are localized mainly \n in the bone marrow and \n periosteum .\nthey are characterized by cuboidal \n and flat morphology ( diameter about \n 20  m ) , present a large \n amount of rough endoplasmatic reticlum and a large golgi apparatus , \n and are potent to produce osteoid , a collagen i rich matrix \n . \n\nin addition , these mononuclear cells are also responsible \n for osteoid calcification ( hydroxyapatite ) .\ntypical marker proteins for \n osteoblasts are cbfa1/runx2 , osteocalcin , osteopontin , osteonectin , bone \n sialoprotein ( bsp ) , osteoprotegerin \n ( opg ) , collagen i , and alkaline phosphates \n ( alp ) .\nfigure 1 \n gives a brief summary of the expression \n of several markers during osteoblast differentiation .\nosteocytes act in a paracrine and mechanosensory manner , and \n can activate osetoblasts and osteoclasts . \n the latter cell type derived from the \n hematopoietic line , has multiple nuclei and is \n responsible for bone resorption . \n\nits ruffled border is flanked \n by a sealing zone which facilitates local acidification \n and removal of bony \n matrix such as ca , h3po4 , and \n h2co3 \n by endocytosis .\nosteoclasts express \n high levels of tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase \n ( trap ) and cathepsin k. the \n interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is complex . during differentiation ,\nthe ostoblast progenitors express receptor \n activator of nuclear \n factor  ligand ( rankl ) and macrophage colony - stimulating factor \n ( m - csf ) which are strong stimuli for osteoclastogenesis .\nin contrast , \n osteoprotegerin ( opg ) is a potent inhibitor \n of osteoclasts .\nmoreover , the \n interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vivo are regulated \n by several hormones and cytokines , including parathyroid hormone ( pth ) , \n calcitonin , and il-6 .\nit is generally accepted that the \n three - dimensional surface topography \n ( size , shape , surface texture ) is one of \n the most important parameters that influence cellular reactions \n [ 2 , 1119 ] . \n\nalthough many studies have investigated \n cellular reaction to different surface pattern , \n the significance of macro \n structure studies on bone cell behavior is \n questionable since in vivo adhesion \n structures ( e.g. , cell membranes , \n basement membranes ) are comprised of much \n smaller nanometer scale features [ 20 , 21 ] .\nthe immature bone is characterized by an average \n inorganic grain size of \n 1050  nm whereas mature bone has an average \n inorganic grain size of 2050  nm \n ( 25  nm in diameter ) \n . \n\nconsidering these parameters , modern \n implants for bone application have been \n designed with a smooth surface at the \n nanometer level .\nit was surprising that \n some of these have induced the formation of peri - implant \n fibrous tissue and \n implant loosening in vivo , while other implants with a higher \n degree of roughness showed significant better osteoconductive properties \n [ 2325 ] .\nthere are various methods to modify the degree of \n roughness as well as surface energy \n and topography in orthopaedic implants\n. \n typically applied techniques to enhance \n the degree of roughness and promote \n the osteointegrative properties of \n biometals ( e.g. , ti , cocrmo , ss ) are chemical \n etching or anodization and \n \n also sand - blasting , sputter - coating , and machine - tooling .\nthe lack of knowledge in cellular reaction to \n nanostructered biomaterials is based \n to a great extent on \n the difficulty in varying surface chemistry and \n topography independently .\nmoreover , \n the use of different cell lineages and culture \n conditions makes it difficult to \n compare results from different investigators \n [ 2631 ] \n ( table 1 ) . \n\nthere is also a lack of consensus concerning the \n proper representation of implant surface topography \n . \n\none major misunderstanding is the practice of defining a \n surface by its manufacturing process instead of concisely defining the \n topographic measurements [ 17 , 33 ] . \n considering these limitations for interpretation ,\nthe \n following review gives an overview of cellular \n reactions to surface structures \n of different orthopaedic biomaterials .\nthe first step after exposure of any biomaterial \n to a biological environment results in the rapid \n adsorption of proteins to its \n surface . \n\nthe composition , type , amount , and \n conformation of adsorbed proteins regulate the \n secondary phenomena such as \n cellular adherence and protein exchange \n [ 3537 ] \n and also following cellular reactions such as migration , \n proliferation , and differentiation . \n\nthe potency for biomaterials to adsorb \n proteins is influenced by its physiochemical \n\n characteristics such as surface energy or hydrophobicity , \n and is also dependent on \n the local environment ( ph , \n concentration of ions , composition and \n functional groups of proteins , strength \n of solution , temperature ) \n ( vroman effect ) \n ( figures 2 ,   and 3 ) . for inorganic nanocrystals and microstructured \n surfaces\nthere are at least two approaches to change \n their hydrophobic surfaces : \n a ligand exchange reaction can replace the original \n hydrophobic surface with \n bifunctional coupling molecules or an inorganic \n coating such as silica ( 1 ) or \n an encapsulation of nanocrystals in an \n  amphiphile organic coating ( 2 ) .\nthe first phase of protein adsorption onto a \n biomaterial 's surface is characterized \n by the attachment of small rapidly diffusing \n\n proteins , followed by a progressive replacement by larger \n proteins with a high \n affinity to the substrate . here\n, especially proteins \n with arg - gly - asp ( rgd ) \n containing sequences such as fibronectin or \n vitronectin act as cell receptors \n and have chemotactic or adhesive properties to bone cells . \n\nin addition , these rgd - peptides \n also have a strong effect on matrix maturation \n and biomineralization [ 4648 ] .\nafter conditioning of a naked biomaterial by protein adsorption , cells attach rapidly \n on the protein - coated surface . \n besides the influence of proteins , the \n cellular attachement to a nanostructed surface \n\nis also influenced by its physiochemical \n properties , especially by the outer functional groups \n [ 30 , 50 , 51 ] .   \nschweikl et al .  \n showed on self - assembly monolayers that the \n osteoblast proliferation on hydrocarbon \n chains , terminated by ch3 , \n was as high as on amino groups \n ( nh2 ) \n and hydrophilic oxidized surfaces , but significantly lower \n on fluorocarbon \n ( cf3 ) \n groups .\nmller et al \n .  \n showed that \n 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane ( apts ) \n presents amine functional groups which allow for \n grafting rgd tripeptides and \n that the rgd - apts hybrid promotes cell adhesion , \n spreading , and cytoskeletal \n organization . here , the zetal potential ( differences in potentials \n between the surface of a tightly \n bounded layer and a diffuse layer ) \n and the interfacial tension ( wettability ) of \n a surface is crucial [ 54 , 55 ] .\nit was demonstrated for cpti surfaces that the contact angle ( ca ) , \n parameter for \n wettability , increases linearly with the average roughness when \n the angles were \n higher than 45 , but decreases linearly with roughness \n when the angle was less \n than 45 . \n\nrecent data examining osteoblast \n response to controlled surface chemistries indicate that \n hydrophilic surfaces \n ( high number of polar components ) improve cell attachment \n and matrix synthesis and also the osteogenic \n potency compared to hydrophobic \n surfaces [ 5759 ] . \n\ncompared ti alloys and cocr alloys towards protein \n absorptive properties and cell attachment with an \n osteoblast precursor cell \n line .\nthey found no significant \n differences between ti alloys and cocr , \n but significantly greater cell adhesion \n rates for the ti implants and concluded that cell \n adhesion is a result of \n higher hydrophilicity of ti alloys . in \n contrast\n, other data showed that a low degree \n of wettability promotes protein \n adhesion and also cellular attachment to a biomaterial \n , \n and mller et al .  \n\nfound no direct correlation between the \n wettability of the material surface and the osteoblast attachment and \n proliferation rate .\nalso qu et al .  \n found no significant differences of cell attachement \n on various titanium surfaces with different degrees of wettabilities \n ( hydrophobic acid - etched , coarse - blasted large \n grit acid - etched , hydrophilic modified \n acid - etched , and modified coarse - blasted large grit , \n acid - etched \n ) on mg68 cells .\nheating ( oxygen / atm ) or peroxide treatment of biometals \n result in a thicker oxide layer \n and a more hydrophilic surface .\n. \n  showed that \n heat - treated titanium \n surfaces changed the wettability ( more hydrophilic ) \n but does not significantly \n affect the fibronectin and albumin adsorption as well as \n the initial osteoblast \n precursor cell attachment in vitro . \n\nemphasized that the rate \n of protein correlates more with changes in chemical \n composition than \n with changes in wettability in metal surfaces .\nthey showed that \n a preheating of ti6al4v specimen does not only lead to a \n thicker oxide layer but also results in \n an enrichment of v and al within \n the surface oxide .\nin contrast , \n post - treatment with butanol after preheating \n reduces the content of v , but not in al , \n and significantly increases the rate \n of fibronectin adsorption up to 2040% \n .\ncompared to the cellular attachment phase , the following adhesion \n phase lasts longer and \n involves various proteins and molecules \n ( figure 2 ) . \n as a link between cell and \n biomaterial , the interactions of a surface topography \n and serum proteins are \n crucial for the cytocompatibility of a biomaterial . \n\nespecially , the adsorption \n of adhesion proteins , such as fibronectin and vitronectin , from serum \n containing solutions and integrin - mediated signaling has been \n demonstrated to \n mediate cell adhesion and spreading \n . it has been shown that nanotube or nanoparticle surfaces \n created by anodization have \n promoted osteoblast adhesion up to three times \n compared to unanodized ti . \n\nthese results were confirmed by the group of webster \n \n and other investigators [ 6871 ] \n who demonstrated that the initial \n attachment of osteoblasts onto the surface of biometals such as cpti , \n ti6al4v , and cocrmo is enhanced by submicron to nanometer \n consistent particles compared \n to metals composed of respective micron particles . \n\none possible explanation of \n this phenomenon is the higher amount of particle binding sites for \n osteoblast adhesion at the surfaces of nanophase metals \n compared to micron particle size \n metals .\nthe theory of enhanced protein and cell binding capacities \n by larger \n surface areas / roughness degrees was also confirmed for porous \n ha materials .\nanother example of the significance of surface structures \n for protein binding and \n osteoblast attachment is the helical rosette nanotubes \n ( hrn ) which can build \n self - assembly surface structures .\nit was demonstrated that \n a significant change \n of hrn coverage by heating correlated with the protein - binding \n and osteoblast \n adhesion potency in titanium surfaces [ 73 , \n 74 ] .\nit is evident that not only the surface topography \n influences protein deposition and \n cell adherence but also proteins and cells modify the surface \n properties of a \n defined surface .\nbased on a surface analysis of the different \n biometal specimen \n before and after cell cultivation , we showed previously \n \n that a cell attachment and/or protein \n precipitation increase the roughness in polished biomaterials \n ( steel , ti6al4v , \n and cocr ) .\nfor porous coated cocr surfaces , we found only slight and no \n relevant changes in roughness whereas cell cultivation onto \n sandblasted ti6al4v \n lead to a strong decrease in specimen roughness . \n\nboth , the increase in roughness after \n cell culturing in the different biometals \n and the decrease in roughness of sandblasted ti6al4v could be \n explained by the \n dense cellular growth and accumulation of debris in depth of \n the structured surfaces \n and/or protein deposition as shown by other investigators \n [ 75 , 76 ] .\nin addition , not only the amount but also the type of \n protein adsorption by a \n surface is crucial for cellular adherence and following reactions such as \n migration and differentiation . as an example , ti surfaces ( ra : \n 0.370.01  m ) adsorp \n  fibronectin in higher concentrations \n compared to albumin , and fibronectin - coated ti surface promoted \n more osteoblast attachments \n in comparison to albumin - coated ti surfaces \n . \n\nthese results correspond to the data of other authors \n who showed excellent osteoconductive properties after \n fibronectin adsorption \n onto a biomaterials ' surface [ 7880 ] . based on irm and tem analysis ,\nthe closest distance \n of cells to a surface ( glass ) was \n found to be approximately 10  nm [ 81 , \n 82 ] .\nhistorically , results from chicken \n fibroblasts have lead to a classification of three different types of \n separation .\n( 1 ) focal contacts ( fc ) : approximately \n 1015  nm separation from the substrate under the \n peripheral regions of the leading lamellae \n ( appearing black in tem ) .\nfc act as \n an interface between intra and extracellular components and occur linearly \n beneath the associated cytoplasmic stress fibres \n [ 83 , \n 84 ] . \n\nthey are tenacious adhesion sites that \n remain attached to the substratum even when cells are forcibly detached , \n indicating their function as anchorage \n structures .\n( 2 ) close contacts : corresponding to approximately \n 30  nm separation ( broader grey areas \n in tem ) .\n( 3 ) greater separation : corresponding to approximately \n 100140  nm ( white \n regions in tem ) .\nit is evident that not only fc appear soon after cellular attachment but also that ( -catenin - positive ) adherence \n junctions occur within 14 hours \n for grooved ti - based substrates . \n\nthese observations underline the high \n significance of an early intercellular communication soon \n after adherence to a \n surface .\nthe mechanisms of initial cellular adherence to a surface are \n different from long - term adherence as shown by a lack of statistical \n correlation between short - term adhesion ( strength of cell attachment \n and early \n adhesion ) and long - term adhesion ( strength of cell - matrix interface ) \n forces [ 14 , 15 , 86 ] . \n\n. \n \n showed that the cultivation time has an \n influence on the long - term adhesion in biometal surfaces according to \n  td \n ( t ) = atb , \n a being independent of b ( td : time - dependend \n adhesion index , a : surface - dependent parameter , b : substrat - independent \n exponent , 0.5+/-0.03 ) . for polylactides ( plla ) , it was shown on oct-1 osteoblast - like \n cells that cell \n adhesion but not the proliferation could be enhanced by nanoscale \n and microscale \n roughness compared to smooth surfaces .\nin addition , \n there is evidence that fc \n show a dynamic behavior which allows for cellular migration and motility . \n\nlinear plla fibres with length scales of 0.52  m , \n constructed by electrospinning , have shown cellular contact \n guidance and enhanced \n osteoblastic differentiation . here , cell morphology revealed that cells \n grown on fibres had smaller projected areas than those on planar \n surfaces .\nalso other polymers such as plga have been shown to \n be effective in enhancing osteoblast differentiation in vitro \n .\ndiener et al .   demonstrated \n on mg-63 osteoblastic cells \n that fc adhesion was smaller on ti and ss than on collagen - coated glass \n coverslips and that all fc showed a mobility of focal adhesions .\nhowever , \n anselme et al .   found higher \n adhesions on ti6al4v \n substrates than on noncollagen - covered glass samples , \n and emphasized that substrates \n with various surface compositions \n but with the same surface topography did not \n induce significant differences of adhesion .\nbased on the knowledge of protein adsorption and its effects \n on cellular attachment and adherence , a selective surface coating \n of nanostructured \n surfaces with rgd or collagen proteins offer a promising solution \n to improve \n the number of osteoblasts adhered on artificial surfaces \n [ 53 , 95102 ] .\nimprinting \n surfaces technology with deposition of specific \n protein - recognition sites can \n help to promote osteoblastic growth \n and differentiation [ 103106 ] .\nprotein - recognition \n can be based on a protein - ligand binding and/or electron donor - acceptor \n interactions or other types of binding forces .\nintegrin \n 51 and 5 \n v3 subunits competitively \n bind to rgd - sites of fibronectin [ 107 , \n 108 ] .\ndependent on the \n surface topography and \n chemistry of the \n\n biomaterial , fibronectin \n undergoes changes in structure including \n modulation in functional activity and \n shift in integrin binding capacity .\nbased on the data of self - assembled monolayers , \n it was shown that integrin subunits \n show selective binding capacities to different \n terminal groups .\nintegrin 51 shows a \n strong affinity to oh and \n nh2 surfaces , whereas \n 51 and \n 5v3 bind also to cooh but show poor binding capacities \n on ch3 \n surfaces [ 109113 ] .\nfurthermore , some data show that oh \n and nh2 surfaces can up - regulate \n osteoblast - specific gene expression but also \n matrix mineralization compared \n with cooh and \n ch3 \n functional groups [ 47 , 112 ] .\ncell migration and proliferation is the attachment \n following phase between the cell \n and the material surface .\nit   is evident for designing \n nanostructured implants \n that cells use the nanotopography of a substrate for \n orientation and migration [ 117119 ] .\nalthough \n it is known that bone cells \n align along defined substrate morphologies ( contact \n guidance ) , the detailed relation between ordered \n nanotopography and cell \n behavior remains unknown in detail . \n\nfor the first time , in 1964 it was shown \n that convex surfaces enhance cellular overlap , while \n grooves minimize cellular \n overlap .\nas pre - requisite to reach a defined cell colonization during \n directed tissue formation , structured nanophase surfaces \n lead to a predictable \n osteoblast orientation and migration on these surfaces \n [ 17 , 121 , 122 ] . \n\ninteraction between the ecm and associated \n changes in the \n orientation of the cytoskeleton are crucial for cell \n metabolism of cells and \n morphology due to actin - myosin tension structures \n .\nanisotropic topographies ( e.g. , \n topographical grooves , chemically patterned stripes , \n or curved surfaces of a \n fibre ) are potent to exert morphological \n as well as physiochemical \n features on cells at the same time , indicative for the \n complex environmental \n influence on cells .\nfocal contacts are important structures for cellular \n adherence onto a surface but may \n also delay migration and mobility of the cells . \n\nit was shown that bone - derived cells ( mg63 cells ) respond to \n a nanoscale roughness by a higher cell thickness and a \n delayed appearance of \n focal contacts . \n\nespecially , nanoporous \n ti - oxide surfaces promote cellular \n spreading and induce numerous filopods and osteoblastic differentiation \n [ 124 , \n 125 ] . on\nelectrochemically \n microstructured hexagonal \n pattern , mg63-cells go inside \n 30100  m but not in 10  m \n cavities .\nmost authors report a \n parallel orientation of cells cultured on \n polished ( smooth ) surfaces [ 57 , 114 , 126 ] \n ( figure 4 ) .\nanother method to not only enhance cellular adherence but also to \n promote osteoblastic differentiation and \n biomineralization of biometals is a surface anodization , \n for example , by -glycerophosphate sodium and calcium \n acetate [ 6671 ] .\ncellular adhesion via fc may strengthen the linkage \n between cell and ecm and \n also impair the ability to dynamically remodelling \n the ecm and influence the \n migration rate . for \n collagen - coated coverslips , focal adhesion of mg-63 \n osteoblastic cells moved \n with a speed of 60  nm / min , whereas the speed was \n reduced in ti and more in ss \n surfaces .\nanother study \n on nb2o5-coated \n polished cpti samples showed that mc3t3-e1-osteoblast \n migration was fastest on \n smooth surfaces ( ra = 7  nm ) , whereas adhesion strength , \n spreading area , and \n collagen - i synthesis were promoted by intermediate \n roughness ( ra = 15  nm ) .\nhowever , \n it was surprising that higher degrees of roughness \n ( ra = 40  nm ) were rather \n peaked and reduced the speed of adhesion process in the \n same study . besides the surface properties of a biomaterial , \n the cellular migration rate is \n dependent on the cell type and its differentiation stage . \n\na higher migration \n rate is associated with a lower level of osteoblast \n differentiation .\ncells with \n a low motility are characterized by a strong formation of fc \n while motile cells \n form less adhesive structures .\nit was found that mature \n osteoblasts spread out \n and form a greater number of fc when settled on smoother surfaces \n .\nalthough \n cellular spreading is higher on \n smoother surfaces , some data indicate that the \n alp - expression is higher for \n rough isotropic surfaces ( electro - erosion , acid - etching , \n sandblasted ) compared \n to smoother substrates ( machine tooling , polishing ) \n . considering recent publications , there \n is no or only week statistical significance that there \n is a difference between \n the initial number of adherent cells and following proliferation of cells \n cultured onto a biometal or ceramic nano-/microscale surface \n in vitro .\nhowever , \n some authors emphasize that \n the influence of functional chemical groups for cellular migration and \n proliferation are stronger than general surface \n properties such as wettability . \n\nespecially a tio2-layer \n seems to promote \n cellular growth and proliferation on nanostructured \n biometals [ 128 , 129 ] .\nother examples for a promotion of cell - to - bone contact in vitro \n and also in vivo are \n machine - etched ti - surfaces ( e.g. , osteotite ) \n , defined sand - blasted \n implants [ 124 , 125 , 131 ] , and hydroxyapatite ( ha ) coatings , \n for example , by plama - spray techniques [ 132134 ] .\nrecent studies investigating the response of adherent \n cells to nanography surfaces \n indicate that different cell phenotypes have different \n levels of sensitivities [ 117 , 135137 ] . here\n, \n osteoblasts react to features as \n low as to the 10 nm dimensions , which is comparable in size to a single \n collagen fibre .\nmoreover , the qualitative and quantitative kinetics \n in gene and protein expression is \n strongly influenced by topography and physiochemistry \n of a defined surface .\nmicroporous \n ha surfaces seem to promote a high number of fc and \n increased levels of alp but \n short actin stress fibres compared to nonmicroporous ha surfaces \n [ 72 , 139 ] . \n\nthere is also evidence that ti and ha \n surfaces can activate early intracellular signalling \n pathways as shown by \n expression of relevant molecules such as \n - and 1-integrin , fak , erk followed \n by c - jun and c - fos genes for proliferation and alp for differentiation \n [ 139 , 140 ] . \n\nhowever , hallgren et al .  \n found no significant histomorphometric \n and biomechanical differences between nanopatterned and control implants . \n\n.  \n showed that microfabricated \n discontinuous - edge surfaces ( des ) , \n repeated open square boxes with a depth of \n 10  m , alter osteoblast adherence and migration \n but enhance cell multilayering , \n matrix deposition and mineralization when compared to smooth controls .\nin contrast to our data , \n anselme et al .   found \n higher proliferation \n rates on ss compared to ti6al4v .\nhowever , bigerelle et al . \n  demonstrated that neither \n material composition nor surface roughness amplitude influence cell \n proliferation , whereas they found a very significant influence \n on manufacturing \n process and surface topography for long - term adherence \n and proliferation in vitro .\nour in vitro results   confirm the \n well known osteogenic in \n vivo properties of ti implants , which may be based on \n surface factors observed \n on its outer tio2-layer \n [ 143146 ] . \n\nmller et al .  \n demonstrated the ability of osteoblasts \n to grow into an open - porous ti implant ( metal foam ) and li et al\n. \n \n also demonstrated that mc3t3-e1 cells \n attach to and are able to divide well in the inner surface of \n a highly porous \n trabecular ti6al4v implant .\nsome in vitro studies demonstrated an \n enhanced total protein and collagen production , \n as well as increased alp \n activity of osteoblasts cultured on nanoparticulate \n metals ( cpti , ti6al4v , and \n cocrmo ) indicating advantages for nanostructured surfaces \n for osteointegration [ 1 , 149 , 150 ] . based on the \n data of redey et al . , \n it can be concluded that the low \n attachment and collagen production rates are related to a low \n wettability of a \n nanosurface .\nnanotextured surfaces of ti surfaces \n prepared by chemical etching \n have upregulated the expression of bsp and \n op . \n as demonstrated by qu et al . , \n the expression of the bone - associated \n genes such as alp , oc , type - i - collagen , osteoprotegerin , and \n glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate - dehydrogenase is promoted \n by modsla ti surfaces . \n some data also suggest that fluoride - modified \n ti surfaces can stimulate \n osteoblastic differentiation compared to \n unmodified titanium surfaces [ 151 , \n 152 ] .\n. \n  showed in their in vitro experiments that nanophase biometals induce \n significantly greater calcium and phosphorus \n deposition by osteoblasts and also allow for \n calcium and phosphorous precipitation from \n culture media without osteoblasts in \n contrast to microphase ti6al4v and cocrmo . \n\nfurthermore , the authors found \n advantages in mineral precipitation without osteoblast for \n tial4v but no differences \n in dependency to the type of ti ( wrought , microphase , \n or nanophase ) .\nit was \n evident that the increased calcium and phosphorus \n mineral content correlated to \n greater amounts of underlying aluminium content on \n ti6al4v surfaces . although some data indicate \n that nanostructured ti alloys promote non - cell - mediated ca / po4-mineral \n deposition from culture media compared to cocrmo substrates , \n the greatest cell - dependend calcium and \n phosphorus mineral deposition occurred \n on nanophase cocrmo .\nit is evident that micropattern collagen films or \n scaffolds promote not \n only cellular adhesion but also allow for \n an osteoblastic differentiation and \n biocalcification in vitro [ 153155 ] . \n for ha- and dcpp - coated , ti \n surfaces the ca / p ratio influence the biomineralization \n rate in vitro .\nbesides the osteoblast - promoting effects \n of defined substrates and \n surface topographies , some data also allocate \n an inflammatory response induced \n by nano- or microstructured biomaterials . \n\nit was shown in many studies that \n cell - biomaterial interactions can activate macrophages \n which results in the synthesis of proinflammatory \n agents such as tnf , ifn , il-1 and -6 , \n rankl and no [ 157159 ] .\nsome data have \n shown proinflammatory effects of different \n biomaterials which increase with the \n degree of surface roughness . \n here ,\nmacrophage inflammatory protein-1 , tnf , \n monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 , and \n members of the interleukine and leukotriene family \n play a crucial role in \n biometal - induced inflammations \n [ 160164 ] .\nmost studies report about an \n enhanced expression of pro - inflammatory \n cytokines and chemokines by cells \n attached to rougher surfaces .\nsome data also \n indicate that anionic and neutral hydrophilic surfaces \n increase macrophage - monocyte apoptosis and reduce macrophage \n fusion to modulate \n inflammatory responses to implanted materials \n .\nhowever , adverse cellular effects seen with \n metallic implants may \n also be attributed to corrosion products or to \n the separation of metal ions \n ( fe , cr , ni ) which may have a major impact on cellular survival and \n differentiation [ 166168 ] . \n those studies which suggest that a cell - mediated metal ion \n release by biometals that \n  did not affect \n the cell viability or proliferation are \n characterized by short cultivation periods or \n other conditions which limit the \n reliability of data [ 169171 ] . up to date , only few authors report about no significant influence \n of the cellular adherence and expression of osteoblast \n proteins by different \n biometals and surfaces such as alp expression \n [ 172 , \n 173 ] .\nin contrast to the great opportunity enhancing \n biocompatibility and osteogenic potency of surfaces applied on bone by \n nanotechnology , micro- and nanoscaled particles released by friction of \n artificial joints can induce severe \n inflammation and may lead to osteolysis and \n implant failure [ 174 , \n 175 ] \n ( figure 5 , \n table 2 ) . there is a wide \n range in particles size and morphology produced by \n simulators for artificial \n joints .\nparticles released from metal - metal ( crcomo alloys ) are \n predominantly chromium oxide particles or cocrmo with \n varying ratios of co and cr .\nthey show a round to oval morphology \n and also a substantial number of needle - shaped \n particles were found during the first circles . \n\nemphasize the \n importance of particle size \n as a critical factor in osteoblasts proliferation \n and viability in vitro .\nsome data indicate \n that in contrast to ti - surfaces \n nano- and mircoparticles induce an \n inflammatory response although titanium is \n one of the biometals with the highest degree of \n cytocompatibility . as shown by miyanishi et al . \n , \n the release of vegf may play a crucial role in the \n pathogenesis of ti - induced osteolysis .\nsome data indicate that \n phagocytosis of ti particles is not a precondition for \n an inflammatory response \n such as a release of tnf or il-6 in \n cultured macrophages . \n\nit is evident that a binding of the macrophage cd11b / cd18 ( macrophage \n mac-1 receptors / receptor of complement cr3bi , \n can also bind to icam-1 and \n icam-2 ) by integrin - specific antibodies \n also increased the release of tnf and il-6 in macrophages . \n\nthis finding also suggests \n that the complement system plays a role in the pathogenesis \n of particle - induced \n inflammation , too .\nespecially , uhmwpe particles with \n a size range of \n 0.11.0  m have been shown to be most reactive for \n macrophage activation and cytokine \n secretion in bone marrow cells [ 179 , \n 180 ]\n. however , not only the particle size but also the particle volume \n ( number ) is a critical factor for particle - mediated \n release of cytokines by \n macrophages .\ngreen et al . \n demonstrated for pe \n that the cell - particle ratios of 1 : 100 \n ( size 0.497.2  m ) and 1 : 10 \n ( size : 0.494.2  m ) induced \n significant stronger release \n of tnf and il-1 in macrophages . \n\nthe authors conclude that especially \n particles in the phagocytosable size range of \n 0.310  m appear to be the most \n biologically active ones .\nthe latter statement was also confirmed for silicon carbide ( sic ) \n particles and biometals such as cpti , \n ti6al4v and uhmwpe [ 184 , 185 ] .\ngranchi et al .  \n investigated the in vitro \n effects of al2o3 \n and uhmwpe particles in an \n osteoblast - osteoclast co - culture system . \n\nboth particles did not affect either \n cell viability or tnf and gm - csf release , \n whereas il6 release was dependent on \n the particle concentration .\nuhmwpe particles \n increased the release of rankl \n from osteoblasts and induced large amounts \n of multinucleated trap - positive \n giant cells in an osteoblast - osteoclast \n co - culture system .\nalso , \n carbon - based particles with low wear \n factors such as p25-cvd showed a high degree \n of cytocompatibility in vitro . howling et al . \n \ndemonstrated \n on fibroblasts and monocytes that p25-cvd \n particles < 100  nm were significantly less cytotoxic \n to both cell types than \n cocr metal wear particles . \n\nwhile the classical water - suspendable \n nanoc60 nanocrystal is apparently \n cytotoxic to various cell lines , the closely related \n fully hydroxylated , \n c60(oh)24 \n , is nontoxic , \n thus producing no cellular \n response .\nalso , \n functionalized single - walled carbon nanotubes are nontoxic \n to cells in culture [ 198200 ] .\nthere is evidence that not only particle \n size and chemical content but also the concentration strongly influence \n cellular reactions in vitro .\nwilke \n et al .  \n showed a positive correlation between the \n release of proinflammatory cytokines \n ( il-6 , -1 , and tnf ) and amounts of \n ti6al4v - particles \n ( 10 , \n 10 , 10 , \n and 10 particles / ml ) \n by human bone marrow cells over 2 weeks .\nsome in vitro data also indicate that ti particles induce a stronger \n fibroblastic differentiation signal than uhmwpe \n in monocytes and other cells [ 182184 ] .\n.  \n showed that particles \n of high - density polyethylene \n ( hdp ) and ti6al4v induced significantly more \n proinflammatory mediators ( il-1 , \n il-6 , tnf ) and bone resorption compared to \n al2o3 \n and zro2 in vivo . \n\nbased on these data , \n it can be assumed that ceramics show a high \n degree of cytocompatibiltiy . for ha especially , particles with a size \n < 53  m inhibit cellular proliferation , \n especially in osteoblasts and lead \n to a decrease in tgf1 and a significant increase in pge2 and ldh \n concentration , but did not influence the tnf \n or alp titer in vitro . \n it could be concluded that larger ha particles may \n be compatible with bone cells while smaller - sized \n ha particles can both activate \n the osteoclasts and decrease the cell \n population of the osteoblasts in vitro .\nnumerous variables influence the biocompatibility and osteogenic \n potency of nanostructured biomaterials in \n vitro and in vivo .\nbesides the locotypical \n environment in vivo or in vitro , the surface \n structure and the composition of a \n biomaterial affects cellular attachment , \n adherence , proliferation and migration , \n and also \n differentiation and survival of defined cell types . \n here , information about typical \n parameters such as chemical composition , \n surface structure ( topography , geometry , \n roughness , particle size ) , surface energy , \n hydrophobicity , and the degree of \n solubility in aqueous solutions of a biomaterial \n will help to value and grade a \n defined implant concerning its osteblast promoting potency . considering recent publications , we could assume some general \n principles of cytocompatiblity and cell - surface \n interactions in nano- and \n microstructured surfaces .\n( 1 ) wettability of a nanosurface influences significantly \n protein adsorption , which is a prerequisite \n of cellular adherence in serum containing \n solutions .\n( 2 ) nanostructured surfaces enhance the surface area of \n biomaterials and promote cellular adherence . ( 3 ) the chemical outer functional \n groups of a nanosurface significantly influence cellular \n migration , proliferation , and differentiation but direct \n correlations between \n distinct parameters and cell functions are not entirely cleared .\n( 4 ) the formation of fc underly a \n dynamic process and influence the motility and migration of cells . ( 5 ) a higher degree of differentiation \n is corresponding to a decreased cellular motility .\n( 6 ) phagocytable particles with a size \n < 10  m induce the strongest \n cellular response with regard to releasing \n inflammatory cytokines .\n( 7 ) although ti has a high degree of \n cytocompatibility in vitro , phagocytable \n ti particles can induce a fibroblastic \n differentiation ."}

18 years old followup study of nonself centering bateman bipolar endoprosthesis for nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head concluded that the original bateman endoprosthesis was effective in delaying the need for tha for more than 10 years in ficat stage 3 avn of the femoral head . however , the sample size was very small , with 4 out of 12 patients having some groin pain and study limited to ficat stage iii avn only . in another study tsumura\net al.45 found no difference in clinical results however incidence of migration in ficat 2 and 3 stage was less when compared with stage 4 . based on this\nthey recommended bha only for ficat stages 2 and 3 . in our study , we have used bha for both stages 3 and 4 stages .\nalthough the final range of motion was better in ficat stage 3 group , the final hhs was similar in both the groups showing effectiveness of bha with tight fitting cup in both ficat 3 and 4 stages .\nthus , even in cases with acetabular involvement this technique can be used with good clinical results and can defer the need for tha .\nbipolar hip arthroplasty using tight fitting cup for avn hip has a low incidence of groin pain , acetabular erosion , and revision in midterm followup .\nthis procedure can be used for treatment in young adults with ficat stages 3 and 4 avn of the femoral head to defer a definitive tha .\nfurther large series with long term followups , multicentric randomized studies and reproducibility of results will be needed to establish this method ."}

sulphonamides has been shown to be reduced in milk . selecting a substance with a low minimum inhibitory concentraton ( mic ) value for the target pathogen\nthe antimicrobial should have bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic action , because phagocytosis is impaired in the mammary gland .\nhowever , activity in vitro does not guarantee efficacy in vivo when treating bovine mastitis .\nantimicrobial resistance amongst mastitis pathogens has not yet emerged as a clinically relevant issue , but geographical regions may differ in this respect .\nthe biggest problem is the widespread resistance of staphylococci , particularly staphylococcus aureus , to penicillin g .\ncure rates for mastitis caused by penicillin - resistant strains of s. aureus seem to be inferior to those of mastitis due to penicillin - susceptible strains .\nit is not known if this is due to pharmacologic problems of the drugs used , or virulence factors possibly linked to -lactamase gene of the resistant isolates . using an in vitro -lactamase test for determining resistance to penicillin g of staphylococci before treatment\ncoagulase - negative staphylococci tend to be more resistant than s. aureus and easily develop multiresistance .\nmastitis causing streptococci have remained susceptible to penicillin g , but emerging resistance to macrolides and lincosamides has been detected .\nantimicrobial susceptibility of coliform bacteria varies but normally is not a limiting factor for therapy .\nan important question regarding the treatment of mastitis is whether the antimicrobial should accumulate in the milk or in the udder tissue .\nthe target site may depend on the causative agent : streptococci are known to remain in the milk compartment , but s. aureus penetrates udder tissue and causes deep infection ( table 1 ) .\nthe advantages of this route are high concentrations of the substance achieved in the milk and low consumption of the antimicrobial as the drug is directly infused into the diseased quarter .\nfor example , concentration of penicillin g in milk after imm administration is 100 - 1000 times as high as the concentration after systemic ( parenteral ) administration .\na disadvantage of the imm administration is uneven distribution throughout the udder   and the risk of infecting the quarter when infusing the product via the teat canal .\nefficacy of imm treatment varies according to the causative pathogen , with the best therapeutic response being shown for mastitis caused by streptococci , coagulase - negative staphylococci , and corynebacterium spp .. where to target antimicrobial therapy in clinical mastitis due to different pathogens   the systemic route of administration has been suggested to be more efficient than imm for the treatment of clinical mastitis as antimicrobials theoretically have better penetration of the udder tissue by this route .\nhowever , it is difficult to attain and maintain therapeutic concentrations in milk or udder tissue following systemic administration .\nmany commonly used broad -

{"id": 93, "text": "approximately 40 million people are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) worldwide ( unaids 2006 ) .\ninfections by this lentivirus from the family retroviridae are characterized by a long asymptomatic period after host immune defenses control the initial infection . during this subsequent chronic phase of infection , hiv slowly diminishes the host\nthe virus replicates by hijacking the intracellular molecular machinery to transcribe viral rna , and eventually the productively infected cells die ( fauci 1988 ) . over time , the density of virions in the blood stream increases and the immune system functioning becomes progressively compromised , leaving hiv - infected individuals increasingly susceptible to opportunistic infections .\nbeing blood - borne , hiv is transmitted via contact with the blood of an infected individual : through transfusions , needle - sharing , sexual contact or from mother to child during childbirth or breast - feeding .\ninitially there were concerns that hiv might be vector - borne ( e.g. , transmitted via mosquitoes ) but it has since become widely accepted that such transmission does not occur at any significant level ( bockarie and paru 1996 ) .\nthis current belief stems both from epidemiological data and experimental studies that directly examine the potential for hiv transmission via arthropods ( lawrence 1987 ; lifson 1988 ; bockarie and paru 1996 )\n. why is hiv not vector - borne ( throughout this article we use the term  vector synonymously with \narthropod ) ? the majority of medical scientists , when asked this question , will offer the following explanations ( bockarie and paru 1996 ) : ( i ) hiv concentrations in the blood are too low during human infection to permit vector transmission ; ( ii ) hiv is unable to survive long enough outside of humans ( or primates ) for vector transmission ; ( iii ) hiv is not able to replicate within arthropod vectors .\neach of these explanations has empirical support ( lifson 1988 ; bockarie and paru 1996 ) and thus all three are good explanations for the lack of vector transmission in hiv .\nif most arthropods pick up very little hiv when feeding on humans , and if the level of hiv in ( or on ) these vectors quickly decays , then no significant vector transmission is expected to occur .\nthe above findings provide a satisfying proximate explanation for the lack of vector transmission in hiv .\ngiven the current characteristics of hiv , these three features of the virus make it unlikely that vector transmission will occur . in this article , we approach this question from an evolutionary perspective . therefore , rather than taking the characteristics of hiv as given , we are interested in understanding why hiv has evolved these particular features and not others instead . for example :\n( i ) why has hiv not evolved a replication strategy that results in viral concentrations high enough to allow vector transmission ? ( ii ) why has hiv not evolved to be more durable and thus to survive longer outside of humans ?\n( iii ) why has hiv not evolved the ability to replicate in arthropod vectors ?\nasking such questions might strike many readers as strange since much of evolutionary biology proceeds by asking why certain features of organisms are as we observe them rather than by asking why some features are absent .\nthis is only natural , since it is difficult to decide which , among the infinite number of  missing features , should be the focus of study .\nit is useful to view such questions as falling on a continuum , from questions about the lack of traits that are virtually non - existent in all taxa ( e.g. , why do dogs not have wheeled appendages ) to questions about the lack of traits that are common in some populations or species but not others ( e.g. , why do german shepherds not have curly hair ? ) .\nour contention is that , by asking such questions about the absence of some traits , we can gain deeper insight into biology . to quote philosopher arthur eddington ( 1927 ) ,   the contemplation in natural science of a wider domain than the actual leads to a far better understanding of the actual .  . as in all science , however , not all questions are interesting , and this serves as our primary guide for focusing on some missing features and not others . in particular , we focus on the lack of vector transmission in hiv , because of the profound epidemiological significance of its absence .\nan arthropod - transmissible form of hiv would clearly exacerbate the already devastating impact of the disease , opening up routes of transmission to groups previously at low - risk ( e.g. , children ) .\ntherefore , it is worth asking why , from an evolutionary standpoint , this has not occurred ( weiss 2001 ) .\nmore to the point , if there are conditions under which hiv could have evolved vector transmission we would do well to understand these , not only from the standpoint of scientific curiosity , but also to prevent such an outcome in the future . in this article , we address the question of why hiv lacks vector transmission , both through a consideration of available empirical data and through the construction of mathematical models . although our results are necessarily speculative , we believe that they shed some light on the evolutionary biology of hiv , and on the evolutionary biology of blood - borne pathogens more generally .\nthere are two broad reasons why a trait of interest ( in this case vector - transmission ) might not evolve .\nfirst , the necessary genetic variation for the trait might arise only very rarely ( if at all ) .\nfor instance , the evolution of rna viruses , such as hiv , could be strongly constrained by the size of their genome ( holmes 2003 ) .\nsecond , the necessary form and strength of natural selection might not be present for the trait to evolve , at least over the timescale under consideration .\nthus , from an evolutionary standpoint , hiv is not vector - borne because either the necessary genetic variation for such transmission has never arisen , or the necessary selective factors that would make such variants increase in frequency over the relevant timescale have not occurred .\nour evolutionary explanation for why hiv is not vector - borne will be sought within these two possibilities . before beginning to consider these explanations\nthere are two different processes that might result in vector - transmission , and that are often lumped under this single heading .\nthis occurs when the arthropod acts solely as a means of physical transport of viral particles between hosts ( e.g. , having viral particles in and around mouthparts ) .\nthis occurs when the virus replicates within the arthropod vector during the time period between feeding events .\nhow likely is it that hiv has not evolved vector transmission because of a lack of appropriate genetic variation ? the most direct way to assess this possibility is to determine if genetic variants capable of vector transmission are currently present in the hiv population .\nunfortunately , performing such an assay on all genotypes within the population would be next to impossible .\nfurthermore , if variants capable of vector transmission are selectively disadvantageous , then their frequency in the population might be extremely low . nevertheless , there are some studies available that take this approach as far as is possible . a second approach to addressing this issue\nif some of hivs close relatives have evolved vector - transmission , then the premise that genetic variation for this route of transmission in hiv does not exist would be significantly weakened .\nbelow we review both types of evidence , for both mechanical and biological transmission . mechanical transmission :\na number of studies working directly with hiv have assayed its ability to be transmitted mechanically by arthropods .\nsuch transmission is often difficult to assess under natural conditions , and therefore most studies have employed artificial experimental setups , using a variety of arthropods including mosquitoes , stable flies , and tabanids ( e.g. , horse flies and deer flies ) .\nfor example , hiv was found to be viable for up to 10 days in african soft ticks , and perhaps even up to 14 days ( humphrey - smith et al .\n1989 found that hiv can remain infectious for up to 8 days in the gut of cimex hemipterus .\nmost research on this topic has stressed the need for large bloodmeal size , however , because hiv tends not to have a very high viral titre during infection in humans ( lifson 1988 ; webb et al .\nthis has led to a focus on arthropods , like ticks , whose bloodmeal sizes are often 70 times larger than that of mosquitoes ( humphrey - smith et al . 1993 ) .\nit has also been suggested that squashing mosquitoes while they are feeding , and subsequently scratching the area ( which might result in lacerations ) could increase the likelihood of transmission as well ( siemens 1987 ) .\nother studies of closely related viruses suggest that , in principle , there is no obvious barrier to mechanical transmission of hiv by arthropods .\nin fact , it has also been suggested that mechanical vector transmission might be the route through which hiv was initially transmitted to humans ( eigen et al .\nat least three other retroviruses can be transmitted mechanically , including bovine leukemia virus , friend murine leukemia virus , and equine infectious anemia virus ( foil and issel 1991 ; humphrey - smith et al .\nthe latter ( equine infectious anemia virus ) is believed to be a close relative of hiv ( mcclure et al .\n1988 ) , and epidemiological evidence suggests that vector transmission might play a significant role in its transmission ( foil and issel 1991 ) .\ninterestingly , however , all three of these retroviruses tend to reach viral titres in their hosts that are much higher than those typical of hiv ( foil and issel 1991 ) .\nit has also been suggested that some hepatitis viruses can be transmitted mechanically by arthropods ( jupp et al .\neven if this does occur , however , the viral levels of hiv in humans are thought to be about 10 to 100 times lower than that of some hepatitis viruses ( foil and issel 1991 ) , again implicating hivs low titre during infection of humans as the primary reason that mechanical transmission does not occur in this virus . biological transmission : despite evidence that mechanical transmission of hiv by arthropods can occur , there is no evidence that biological transmission is possible .\n( 1993 ) found that hiv can remain viable in ticks for up to 2 weeks , they failed to find any evidence that hiv can replicate in these vectors .\nevidence has been reported of hiv - related nucleic acids being found in tsetse flies from central africa ( becker et al .\n1986 ) , but this has been controversial , and epidemiological evidence is not indicative of vector transmission ( noireau et al .\nfurthermore , experiments using cell cultures from arthropods have demonstrated that hiv is not capable of replicating in these cells ( srinivasan et al .\nin fact , no evidence exists to date that any retrovirus is capable of biological transmission by arthropods ( webb et al .\n1989 ; foil and issel 1991 ; kuno 2004 ; kuno and chang 2005 ) .\nit remains unclear exactly why such replication is not possible , but functional constraints on receptor use in arthropods versus mammals provides one proximate explanation ( van den heuvel et al .\nalternatively , it remains possible that appropriate genetic variation can arise , but that selection simply does not favor the spread of biological transmission in hiv or other retroviruses .\nthe above empirical findings suggest that , in principle , hiv is capable of being transmitted mechanically . in practice , however , the typical hiv viral titre in the bloodstream of humans is too low for significant vector - borne transmission to occur ( lifson 1988 ; webb et al .\nthere is evidence of genetic variation for differences in viremia in hiv - infected patients ( kanki et al .\n1999 ) and this therefore suggests that mechanical transmission should be evolutionarily feasible if it were selectively advantageous .\nthus , we are forced to ask : why have genetic variants of hiv that induce higher viremia , and thus that transmit mechanically via arthropods , not increased in frequency ?\non the other hand , there is no evidence to suggest that biological transmission can occur , even in principle .\nthis might be because the relevant genetic variation for such transmission has not appeared ( or perhaps is not possible ) .\nalternatively , perhaps such variation does occasionally arise , but that such strains are acted against by natural selection . in this section\nwe use some mathematical calculations to elucidate potential reasons why selection might not favor increased viremia and thus mechanical vector transmission in hiv .\nmechanical transmission : to understand the form and strength of selection shaping the evolution of hiv viremia it is helpful to quantify the important properties of hiv epidemiology in terms of a mathematical model . at present hiv infection is increasing in prevalence in the human population ( unaids 2006 ) .\nthe simplest description of this is exponential growth in the number of infected individuals ; where y(t ) is the number of hiv - positive individuals at time t , and r is the per capita growth rate .\nalthough the rate of increase of hiv appears to be slowing in recent years , exponential growth nevertheless provides a useful benchmark for its initial spread in humans .\nthe per capita growth rate will depend on various properties of hiv , including its mode of transmission . to derive an expression for the per capita growth rate of hiv - positive individuals in terms of underlying epidemiological parameters , we first need to specify a model for the epidemiological dynamics .\nthis model will allow for both sexual transmission of hiv as well as insect transmission , and therefore it will also track the number of insects carrying hiv . using w(t ) for the number of insects carrying hiv at time t , and y(a , t ) as the number of hiv - positive people who were infected a years ago , we specify the dynamics as with boundary condition . in equations ( 2 ) , v is the population size of insects free of hiv , a is the insect - biting rate , b1 is the probability of an insect picking up hiv , given it feeds on an infected human , and  is the per capita loss rate of infected insects ( which subsumes both insect mortality and the decay of hiv stores in or on the insect ) .\nnote that , although many insects display a characteristic time lag between feeding events , for simplicity we have ignored this . also note that , for simplicity , equations ( 2 ) implicitly assume that the likelihood of an insect picking up hiv from an infected human is constant across all infection ages ( i.e. , it does not depend on a ) .\nthe parameter b2 is the probability that an insect - carrying hiv infects a human when feeding , and x is the number of hiv - negative people .\nwe assume that the number of susceptible insects and people are both constant over the timescale of interest because hiv infection is still increasing in prevalence in the human population ( unaids 2006 ) .\nthe parameter  is the transmission rate through sexual contact of hiv , and is assumed to be independent of infection age .\nour assumption is justified on the basis that we are concerned with average viremia throughout the entire infection , and viral loads during the acute infection phase are strongly correlated with viral loads during the subsequent chronic phase ( kelley et al . 2007 ) .\nresults in appendix 1 also show that the main conclusions are not altered by relaxing this assumption .\nlastly , (a ) is a function describing the mortality rate of hiv - positive people as a function of infection age .\nin particular , we will suppose that (a ) has the form where  is the time during the infection at which aids develops .\nthis model is analyzed in appendix 1 to show that the asymptotic per capita rate of increase , r , is defined implicitly , as a function of various epidemiological parameters , by the equation : some of the parameters in equation ( 4 ) will depend on the level of viremia in humans , and therefore viremia will affect the per capita rate of spread of hiv . in particular , the amount of hiv picked up by an arthropod during a feeding , b1 , is expected to increase with viremia . similarly , evidence suggests that sexual transmission rate ,  , also increases with viremia ( operskalski et al . 1997\nlastly , evidence also shows that high levels of viremia lead to a more rapid development of aids , and thus a lower value of  in untreated patients ( mellors et al .\nwith these specifications , our question about the evolution of mechanical transmission of hiv can now be cast in population - genetic terms .\nsuppose the predominant strain of hiv is one that gives rise to a viremia too low for vector transmission ( i.e. , b1  0 ) .\nalso suppose that a mutant strain arises that produces a viremia high enough for mechanical vector transmission .\nassuming that multiple infections do not occur ( an assumption that we relax below ) , the rate of change in frequency , p , of this mutant strain is ( day and gandon 2007 ) where ra is the per capita growth rate of the original strain and rb is the per capita growth rate of the mutant strain . specifically , ra and rb are implicitly defined , from equation ( 4 ) , as respectively .\nequations ( 6 ) make the implicit assumption that the increased viremia of the mutant strain does not significantly increase its sexual transmission rate .\nmore precisely , sexual transmission must be a concave function of viremia with an optimal viral load that is lower than for vector transmission for the following argument to hold .\nempirical evidence in support of this functional form for hiv exists ( quinn et al .\n, a comparison of equations ( 6a ) and ( 6b ) reveals that rb will be smaller than ra ( i.e. , the mutant strain will decrease in frequency ) and hiv will be predominately sexually transmitted , when the following conditions hold : vector mortality , or the hiv decay rate , is high ( i.e. , large  ) , vector population size is small ( i.e. , small v ) , vector biting rate is small ( i.e. , small a ) , or the hiv transfer rates to and from vectors , b1 and b2 , are small . indeed , rb is not only less than ra in such situations ( as in fig .\n1 ) , but often negative as well , meaning that vector transmissible strains will not only decrease in frequency but in absolute numbers . therefore ,\nsome or all of the above conditions must hold if this analysis is to explain why hiv has not evolved mechanical vector transmission .\nconversely , if the opposite conditions hold , then the mutant will increase in frequency , and both sexual and mechanical vector transmission will play a significant role in the disease s epidemiology ( fig .\n1 ) . sexual transmission rate ( solid line ) and vector transmission rate ( dashed line ) as a function of viremia , . the resulting per capita growth rate based on equation ( 4 ) is also plotted ( growth rate is negative where is falls below the horizontal axis , meaning that such strains can never increase in number ) .\nb denote the sexually transmitted and vector transmitted genotypes considered in model ( 5 ) of the text .\nparameter values : 0 = 1/65 , a = 1 , v = 100 , x = 5 ,  = 15 .\nthese considerations provide the conditions required for the spread of a mutant with mechanical vector transmission , but they do not tell us the time frame over which such spread occurs .\nfor example , it would be useful to know by how much arthropods must increase the overall transmission rate of hiv if such strains are to have increased significantly in frequency during the period of time in which hiv has been evolving in humans .\nthe calculations in appendix 2 demonstrate that the factor by which vectors must increase the overall transmission rate of hiv , in order for the relative frequency of the mutant , p/(1  p ) , to increase by a factor of k over a period of t years , is given by all parameters in equation ( 7 ) can be estimated except k , t , and b ( appendix 2 ) , yielding fig .\nthe factor by which vectors must increase the overall transmission rate of hiv in order for a vector transmissible virus to increase in relative frequency by a factor of k , as a function of the amount of time over which evolution occurs ( between 30 and 50 years for hiv in humans ) .\nsolid lines assume that the increased viremia caused by the vector - transmissible virus decreases the time until the development of aids from a = 8 to b = 5 years .\nthe parameter k has very little effect over several orders of magnitude , meaning that the benefit of vector transmission required for it to evolve over 3050 years is determined largely by the value of b .\nfirst , note that changes in k ( the amount of increase that must occur for evolutionary change to be deemed \n, we can view any of these curves as general requirements for significant evolution of vector transmission to have occurred during the past 30 to 50 years .\nalso , as expected , the curves are decreasing , reflecting the fact that a smaller benefit of vector transmission is required to generate significant evolution if evolution has longer to act .\nmore interestingly we can see that , if the increased viremia that allows for vector transmission also results in the development of aids after only 5 years as opposed to 8 years , then arthropods would need to cause a doubling of hiv transmission rate for appreciable evolution to have occurred . on the other hand , if increased viremia results in the development of aids after only 1 year , then arthropods would need to increase hiv transmission rate by 5- or 6-fold for appreciable evolution to have occurred .\nunfortunately , there are currently no estimates available of these parameters , but these calculations nevertheless suggest that significant mechanical transmission could have evolved within the last 3050 years under biologically plausible conditions . therefore , the lack of vector transmission in hiv can not immediately be attributed to an insufficient evolutionary history of hiv in humans . biological transmission : although there is no evidence suggesting that the required genetic variation for biological transmission is possible in hiv ( or any other retrovirus ; foil and issel 1991 ; kuno 2004 ; kuno and chang 2005 ; webb et al .\n1989 ) , it is nevertheless instructive to consider whether there might also be reasons associated with the nature and strength of selection for why such transmission has not evolved . equation ( 5 ) can again be used in this context , with equation ( 4 ) again defining the per capita growth rate for different strains of hiv .\nbiological transmission need not require an increased viremia in humans , however , because the pathogen would replicate to transmissible levels once in the arthropod vector . as a result , strains that are capable of biological vector transmission need not result in the more rapid development of aids . without some associated cost , however\n, biological vector transmission would clearly enhance the growth rate of hiv and thus would readily evolve .\nthus , if an absence of such transmission is to be explained in terms of selection ( as opposed to an explanation based on a lack of genetic variation ) then there must be some associated cost .\nthere are at least two biologically plausible mechanisms through which such a cost might arise .\nfirst , effective biological vector transmission might require evolutionary changes that reduce hivs capacity for sexual transmission . in this case\n, the cost stems from an evolutionary trade - off between these two transmission routes .\nthe sexually transmitted form would have a growth rate defined by whereas the vector - transmitted form would have a growth rate defined by the parameter values in equations ( 8) \n could readily be such that the growth rate of the vector - transmitted strain was less than that of the sexually transmitted strain .\nthere is , however , no a priori reason why this would be expected rather than the reverse .\ntherefore , it does not provide a very compelling answer as to why biological transmission has not evolved in hiv , particularly given that it is absent in all other retroviruses as well .\nthe second way in which a cost of biological transmission might arise is through a conflict between natural selection acting on transmission of hiv between hosts , and natural selection acting on the virus replicative capacity within a host .\nit is well documented in hiv ( and other retroviruses ) that extensive genetic variation arises within an infected host via mutation .\nif vector - transmissible strains suffer a cost in terms of their replicative ability within humans , then this within - host natural selection acting against vector transmission might be enough to prevent its spread .\nmodeling the evolutionary consequences of this in hiv is difficult because each infected human will harbor a suite of genetic variants , some of which will be better at exploiting the human host .\nthis will cause evolutionary change in the genetic composition of hiv within the infected individuals . at the same time , this suite of strains is also being transmitted to new hosts via sexual contact and potentially vector transmission .\nthe assumption of the above hypothesis is then that the strains that are better able to transmit to new hosts via vector transmission are not the ones best able to compete for resources within a host .\nthe simplest way to abstract these processes into a tractable model that still retains the fundamental processes at work is to make an assumption of superinfection .\nspecifically , we suppose that humans almost always harbor only a single strain , but occasionally new strains arise by mutation .\nwhen such a mutation occurs , the mutant then either takes over the host or dies out instantaneously , resulting in a single strain infection once again ( levin and pimentel 1981 ; nowak and may 1994 ) . in keeping with our earlier notation we will use b to denote the vector - transmissible form , and a to denote the form best able to compete within a host and thus to transmit sexually . letting  be the rate at which new mutations arise within an infected host , turning either an a pathogen into a b pathogen or vice versa , and using ij to denote the probability that an i mutant so produced will take over a host originally infected with type j , where i and j are either a or b , model ( 5 ) can be extended to yield ( day and proulx 2004 ; day and gandon 2006 ) with ra and rb again given by equations ( 6 ) .\nthe hypothesis under consideration supposes that within - host competition always favors the sexually transmitted form , and thus we take ab = 0 in equation ( 9 ) . in this case , there are then two possible evolutionary outcomes .\nfirst , if rb  ra > ba , then the frequency of vector transmission will ultimately evolve to the equilibrium value . on the other hand , if rb  ra < ba , then vector transmission will never evolve .\nin other words , if the significance of within - host evolution is large relative to the benefit of vector transmission , then vector transmission will never evolve .\nthis will be true whenever the mutation rate of the virus is high ( i.e. , large  ) and when the selective advantage of sexual transmission in terms of within - host competition is large .\nthe first of these is certainly true of most retroviruses , although the second requirement is less well documented . nevertheless , this might provide a selective explanation for why no retrovirus appears to have evolved biological vector transmission .\nhow likely is it that hiv has not evolved vector transmission because of a lack of appropriate genetic variation ?\nthe most direct way to assess this possibility is to determine if genetic variants capable of vector transmission are currently present in the hiv population .\nunfortunately , performing such an assay on all genotypes within the population would be next to impossible .\nfurthermore , if variants capable of vector transmission are selectively disadvantageous , then their frequency in the population might be extremely low .\nnevertheless , there are some studies available that take this approach as far as is possible . a second approach to addressing this issue\nif some of hivs close relatives have evolved vector - transmission , then the premise that genetic variation for this route of transmission in hiv does not exist would be significantly weakened .\nbelow we review both types of evidence , for both mechanical and biological transmission . mechanical transmission :\na number of studies working directly with hiv have assayed its ability to be transmitted mechanically by arthropods .\nsuch transmission is often difficult to assess under natural conditions , and therefore most studies have employed artificial experimental setups , using a variety of arthropods including mosquitoes , stable flies , and tabanids ( e.g. , horse flies and deer flies ) .\nfor example , hiv was found to be viable for up to 10 days in african soft ticks , and perhaps even up to 14 days ( humphrey - smith et al .\n1989 found that hiv can remain infectious for up to 8 days in the gut of cimex hemipterus .\nmost research on this topic has stressed the need for large bloodmeal size , however , because hiv tends not to have a very high viral titre during infection in humans ( lifson 1988 ; webb et al .\nthis has led to a focus on arthropods , like ticks , whose bloodmeal sizes are often 70 times larger than that of mosquitoes ( humphrey - smith et al .\nit has also been suggested that squashing mosquitoes while they are feeding , and subsequently scratching the area ( which might result in lacerations ) could increase the likelihood of transmission as well ( siemens 1987 ) .\nother studies of closely related viruses suggest that , in principle , there is no obvious barrier to mechanical transmission of hiv by arthropods .\nin fact , it has also been suggested that mechanical vector transmission might be the route through which hiv was initially transmitted to humans ( eigen et al .\nat least three other retroviruses can be transmitted mechanically , including bovine leukemia virus , friend murine leukemia virus , and equine infectious anemia virus ( foil and issel 1991 ; humphrey - smith et al .\nthe latter ( equine infectious anemia virus ) is believed to be a close relative of hiv ( mcclure et al .\n1988 ) , and epidemiological evidence suggests that vector transmission might play a significant role in its transmission ( foil and issel 1991 ) .\ninterestingly , however , all three of these retroviruses tend to reach viral titres in their hosts that are much higher than those typical of hiv ( foil and issel 1991 ) .\nit has also been suggested that some hepatitis viruses can be transmitted mechanically by arthropods ( jupp et al .\n1983 ) , although this has been controversial ( kuno 2004 ) . even if this does occur\n, however , the viral levels of hiv in humans are thought to be about 10 to 100 times lower than that of some hepatitis viruses ( foil and issel 1991 ) , again implicating hivs low titre during infection of humans as the primary reason that mechanical transmission does not occur in this virus .\nbiological transmission : despite evidence that mechanical transmission of hiv by arthropods can occur , there is no evidence that biological transmission is possible .\n( 1993 ) found that hiv can remain viable in ticks for up to 2 weeks , they failed to find any evidence that hiv can replicate in these vectors .\nevidence has been reported of hiv - related nucleic acids being found in tsetse flies from central africa ( becker et al .\n1986 ) , but this has been controversial , and epidemiological evidence is not indicative of vector transmission ( noireau et al .\nfurthermore , experiments using cell cultures from arthropods have demonstrated that hiv is not capable of replicating in these cells ( srinivasan et al .\nin fact , no evidence exists to date that any retrovirus is capable of biological transmission by arthropods ( webb et al .\n1989 ; foil and issel 1991 ; kuno 2004 ; kuno and chang 2005 ) .\nit remains unclear exactly why such replication is not possible , but functional constraints on receptor use in arthropods versus mammals provides one proximate explanation ( van den heuvel et al .\nalternatively , it remains possible that appropriate genetic variation can arise , but that selection simply does not favor the spread of biological transmission in hiv or other retroviruses .\nthe above empirical findings suggest that , in principle , hiv is capable of being transmitted mechanically . in practice , however , the typical hiv viral titre in the bloodstream of humans is too low for significant vector - borne transmission to occur ( lifson 1988 ; webb et al .\nthere is evidence of genetic variation for differences in viremia in hiv - infected patients ( kanki et al .\n1999 ) and this therefore suggests that mechanical transmission should be evolutionarily feasible if it were selectively advantageous .\nthus , we are forced to ask : why have genetic variants of hiv that induce higher viremia , and thus that transmit mechanically via arthropods , not increased in frequency ?\non the other hand , there is no evidence to suggest that biological transmission can occur , even in principle .\nthis might be because the relevant genetic variation for such transmission has not appeared ( or perhaps is not possible ) .\nalternatively , perhaps such variation does occasionally arise , but that such strains are acted against by natural selection . in this section\nwe use some mathematical calculations to elucidate potential reasons why selection might not favor increased viremia and thus mechanical vector transmission in hiv .\nmechanical transmission : to understand the form and strength of selection shaping the evolution of hiv viremia it is helpful to quantify the important properties of hiv epidemiology in terms of a mathematical model . at\npresent hiv infection is increasing in prevalence in the human population ( unaids 2006 ) .\nthe simplest description of this is exponential growth in the number of infected individuals ; where y(t ) is the number of hiv - positive individuals at time t , and r is the per capita growth rate .\nalthough the rate of increase of hiv appears to be slowing in recent years , exponential growth nevertheless provides a useful benchmark for its initial spread in humans .\nthe per capita growth rate will depend on various properties of hiv , including its mode of transmission . to derive an expression for the per capita growth rate of hiv - positive individuals in terms of underlying epidemiological parameters , we first need to specify a model for the epidemiological dynamics .\nthis model will allow for both sexual transmission of hiv as well as insect transmission , and therefore it will also track the number of insects carrying hiv . using w(t ) for the number of insects carrying hiv at time t , and y(a , t ) as the number of hiv - positive people who were infected a years ago , we specify the dynamics as with boundary condition . in equations ( 2 )\n, v is the population size of insects free of hiv , a is the insect - biting rate , b1 is the probability of an insect picking up hiv , given it feeds on an infected human , and  is the per capita loss rate of infected insects ( which subsumes both insect mortality and the decay of hiv stores in or on the insect ) .\nnote that , although many insects display a characteristic time lag between feeding events , for simplicity we have ignored this .\nalso note that , for simplicity , equations ( 2 ) implicitly assume that the likelihood of an insect picking up hiv from an infected human is constant across all infection ages ( i.e. , it does not depend on a ) .\nthe parameter b2 is the probability that an insect - carrying hiv infects a human when feeding , and x is the number of hiv - negative people .\nwe assume that the number of susceptible insects and people are both constant over the timescale of interest because hiv infection is still increasing in prevalence in the human population ( unaids 2006 ) .\nthe parameter  is the transmission rate through sexual contact of hiv , and is assumed to be independent of infection age .\nour assumption is justified on the basis that we are concerned with average viremia throughout the entire infection , and viral loads during the acute infection phase are strongly correlated with viral loads during the subsequent chronic phase ( kelley et al .\nresults in appendix 1 also show that the main conclusions are not altered by relaxing this assumption .\nlastly , (a ) is a function describing the mortality rate of hiv - positive people as a function of infection age . in particular\n, we will suppose that (a ) has the form where  is the time during the infection at which aids develops .\nthis model is analyzed in appendix 1 to show that the asymptotic per capita rate of increase , r , is defined implicitly , as a function of various epidemiological parameters , by the equation : some of the parameters in equation ( 4 ) will depend on the level of viremia in humans , and therefore viremia will affect the per capita rate of spread of hiv .\nin particular , the amount of hiv picked up by an arthropod during a feeding , b1 , is expected to increase with viremia .\nsimilarly , evidence suggests that sexual transmission rate ,  , also increases with viremia ( operskalski et al .\nlastly , evidence also shows that high levels of viremia lead to a more rapid development of aids , and thus a lower value of  in untreated patients ( mellors et al . 1997 ; levy 1998 ; raffanti et al .\n, our question about the evolution of mechanical transmission of hiv can now be cast in population - genetic terms .\nsuppose the predominant strain of hiv is one that gives rise to a viremia too low for vector transmission ( i.e. , b1  0 ) .\nalso suppose that a mutant strain arises that produces a viremia high enough for mechanical vector transmission .\nassuming that multiple infections do not occur ( an assumption that we relax below ) , the rate of change in frequency , p , of this mutant strain is ( day and gandon 2007 ) where ra is the per capita growth rate of the original strain and rb is the per capita growth rate of the mutant strain . specifically , ra and rb are implicitly defined , from equation ( 4 ) , as respectively\n. equations ( 6 ) make the implicit assumption that the increased viremia of the mutant strain does not significantly increase its sexual transmission rate .\nmore precisely , sexual transmission must be a concave function of viremia with an optimal viral load that is lower than for vector transmission for the following argument to hold .\nempirical evidence in support of this functional form for hiv exists ( quinn et al .\n, a comparison of equations ( 6a ) and ( 6b ) reveals that rb will be smaller than ra ( i.e. , the mutant strain will decrease in frequency ) and hiv will be predominately sexually transmitted , when the following conditions hold : vector mortality , or the hiv decay rate , is high ( i.e. , large  ) , vector population size is small ( i.e. , small v ) , vector biting rate is small ( i.e. , small a ) , or the hiv transfer rates to and from vectors , b1 and b2 , are small . indeed , rb is not only less than ra in such situations ( as in fig .\n1 ) , but often negative as well , meaning that vector transmissible strains will not only decrease in frequency but in absolute numbers . therefore , some or all of the above conditions must hold if this analysis is to explain why hiv has not evolved mechanical vector transmission .\nconversely , if the opposite conditions hold , then the mutant will increase in frequency , and both sexual and mechanical vector transmission will play a significant role in the disease s epidemiology ( fig .\nsexual transmission rate ( solid line ) and vector transmission rate ( dashed line ) as a function of viremia , . the resulting per capita growth rate based on equation ( 4 ) is also plotted ( growth rate is negative where is falls below the horizontal axis , meaning that such strains can never increase in number ) .\nb denote the sexually transmitted and vector transmitted genotypes considered in model ( 5 ) of the text .\nparameter values : 0 = 1/65 , a = 1 , v = 100 , x = 5 ,  = 15 .\nthese considerations provide the conditions required for the spread of a mutant with mechanical vector transmission , but they do not tell us the time frame over which such spread occurs . for example , it would be useful to know by how much arthropods must increase the overall transmission rate of hiv if such strains are to have increased significantly in frequency during the period of time in which hiv has been evolving in humans . the calculations in appendix 2 demonstrate that the factor by which vectors must increase the overall transmission rate of hiv , in order for the relative frequency of the mutant , p/(1  p ) , to increase by a factor of k over a period of t years , is given by all parameters in equation ( 7 ) can be estimated except k , t , and b ( appendix 2 ) , yielding fig .\nthe factor by which vectors must increase the overall transmission rate of hiv in order for a vector transmissible virus to increase in relative frequency by a factor of k , as a function of the amount of time over which evolution occurs ( between 30 and 50 years for hiv in humans ) .\nsolid lines assume that the increased viremia caused by the vector - transmissible virus decreases the time until the development of aids from a = 8 to b = 5 years .\nthe parameter k has very little effect over several orders of magnitude , meaning that the benefit of vector transmission required for it to evolve over 3050 years is determined largely by the value of b .\nfirst , note that changes in k ( the amount of increase that must occur for evolutionary change to be deemed \n, we can view any of these curves as general requirements for significant evolution of vector transmission to have occurred during the past 30 to 50 years .\nalso , as expected , the curves are decreasing , reflecting the fact that a smaller benefit of vector transmission is required to generate significant evolution if evolution has longer to act .\nmore interestingly we can see that , if the increased viremia that allows for vector transmission also results in the development of aids after only 5 years as opposed to 8 years , then arthropods would need to cause a doubling of hiv transmission rate for appreciable evolution to have occurred . on the other hand , if increased viremia results in the development of aids after only 1 year , then arthropods would need to increase hiv transmission rate by 5- or 6-fold for appreciable evolution to have occurred .\nunfortunately , there are currently no estimates available of these parameters , but these calculations nevertheless suggest that significant mechanical transmission could have evolved within the last 3050 years under biologically plausible conditions . therefore , the lack of vector transmission in hiv can not immediately be attributed to an insufficient evolutionary history of hiv in humans . biological transmission : although there is no evidence suggesting that the required genetic variation for biological transmission is possible in hiv ( or any other retrovirus ; foil and issel 1991 ; kuno 2004 ; kuno and chang 2005 ; webb et al .\n1989 ) , it is nevertheless instructive to consider whether there might also be reasons associated with the nature and strength of selection for why such transmission has not evolved .\nequation ( 5 ) can again be used in this context , with equation ( 4 ) again defining the per capita growth rate for different strains of hiv .\nbiological transmission need not require an increased viremia in humans , however , because the pathogen would replicate to transmissible levels once in the arthropod vector . as a result , strains that are capable of biological vector transmission need not result in the more rapid development of aids . without some associated cost , however\n, biological vector transmission would clearly enhance the growth rate of hiv and thus would readily evolve .\nthus , if an absence of such transmission is to be explained in terms of selection ( as opposed to an explanation based on a lack of genetic variation ) then there must be some associated cost .\nthere are at least two biologically plausible mechanisms through which such a cost might arise .\nfirst , effective biological vector transmission might require evolutionary changes that reduce hivs capacity for sexual transmission . in this case\n, the cost stems from an evolutionary trade -

transmissible form , and a to denote the form best able to compete within a host and thus to transmit sexually . letting  be the rate at which new mutations arise within an infected host , turning either an a pathogen into a b pathogen or vice versa , and using ij to denote the probability that an i mutant so produced will take over a host originally infected with type j , where i and j are either a or b , model ( 5 ) can be extended to yield ( day and proulx 2004 ; day and gandon 2006 ) with ra and rb again given by equations ( 6 ) . the hypothesis under consideration supposes that within - host competition always favors the sexually transmitted form , and thus we take ab = 0 in equation ( 9 ) . in this case , there are then two possible evolutionary outcomes .\nfirst , if rb  ra > ba , then the frequency of vector transmission will ultimately evolve to the equilibrium value . on the other hand ,\nin other words , if the significance of within - host evolution is large relative to the benefit of vector transmission , then vector transmission will never evolve .\nthis will be true whenever the mutation rate of the virus is high ( i.e. , large  ) and when the selective advantage of sexual transmission in terms of within - host competition is large .\nthe first of these is certainly true of most retroviruses , although the second requirement is less well documented . nevertheless , this might provide a selective explanation for why no retrovirus appears to have evolved biological vector transmission .\nexperiments and epidemiological data have unequivocally demonstrated , however , that such vector transmission does not occur at any significant level , and various aspects of hiv biology have been implicated as proximate reasons ( bockarie and paru 1996 ) .\nthese reasons do not offer an explanation for why vector transmission has not evolved , however , and as weiss ( 2001 ) points out , we ought to seriously consider whether such evolution might occur in the future ( for a summary , see table 1 ) .\nmain conclusions of the study existing data suggest that the lack of mechanical vector transmission in hiv is not due to genetic constraints . while ecological constraints , such as number of vectors and biting rates , may limit vector transmission in certain areas , these constraints\nwould likely not explain why hiv has not evolved this form of transmission in areas where vector - borne diseases ( e.g. malaria ) are endemic .\nrather , there must presumably be a reason why such transmission is selectively disadvantageous in hiv .\neffective mechanical vector transmission can be brought about only through the evolution of higher levels of viremia , and this also results in a more rapid onset of aids .\nthis reduces the duration over which such strains can be transmitted from an infected human , more than is made up for by the occurrence of vector transmission .\nit also remains possible that insufficient time has elapsed for the evolution of vector transmission to occur , but our calculations suggest that this is not a very compelling possibility . on the other hand , existing data is largely consistent with the hypothesis that biological vector transmission has not evolved in hiv because of genetic constraints . at the same time\n, it is not possible to rule out a selective explanation instead . in particular ,\nif there is a genetic trade - off between efficient replication in humans and replication in arthropod vectors , then a conflict between selection favoring effective replication within humans , and selection favoring arthropod transmission between humans can readily prevent biological transmission from evolving .\nthis is particularly likely when the mutation rate of the virus is high , and thus might provide an explanation for the lack of biological vector transmission in all retroviruses .\nour analysis might also be extended to include other forms of transmission , for instance needle transmission ( see bruneau et al .\nseveral evolutionary consequences of this are possible depending both on the level of viremia required for such transmission to occur and the resulting transmission rate .\nfor instance , if needle transmission can be achieved with a lower viremia than sexual transmission , and if this leads to a sufficiently high transmission rate , less virulent strains could be favored .\nconversely , if needle transmission requires a high viremia and leads to a sufficiently high transmission rate , more virulent strains would be favored .\nthe only situation in which enhanced needle use could lead to the evolution of vector - borne transmission would be if effective needle transmission requires a viremia close to that of vector - borne transmission , while leading to a much higher transmission rate than vector - borne transmission .\nthis way , strains with high viremia could be maintained in the population through needle transmission , and vector - borne transmission would then occur largely as a byproduct .\nour conclusions in this article are necessarily speculative , but such speculation is a necessary part of the initial stages of any research .\none of our aims is to stimulate future research into the evolutionary biology of hiv transmission . from the results presented here ,\na number of different directions might be taken to ground these evolutionary ideas more firmly in empirical data .\none possibility would be to examine more closely mechanical vector transmission in immunodeficiency viruses of other species .\nfor example , more data on the epidemiological patterns of siv and its potential for alternative routes of transmission would be enormously useful .\nsince siv is believed to be at the evolutionary ancestor of hiv , it would be very interesting to know if the longer evolutionary history it has had with its host has resulted in different transmission patterns .\nto the best of our knowledge , there are no empirical studies testing the potential for vector transmission of siv\n. another fruitful approach might be to conduct artificial selection experiments with hiv in arthropod tissue culture .\nexperiments have demonstrated that hiv can not currently replicate significantly in arthropod cells , but no study to our knowledge has attempted to select for the evolution of hiv replication in such cells .\none could even imagine doing such experiments with both mammalian and arthropod cell cultures to determine of the evolutionary trade - off postulated here actually occurs .\nultimately , it will require innovative experiments and empirical studies to push the boundaries of our knowledge of hiv , and the use of evolutionary biology as a powerful tool for designing sensible intervention strategies .\nthese kinds of studies are beginning to appear for other aspects of hiv biology ( e.g. , see mller et al .\n2006 for an interesting evolutionary analysis of hiv virulence ) but more work on transmission biology would be useful .\nfor example , if further empirical research validated the hypothesis presented here , that mechanical vector transmission has not evolved because of its associated mortality costs , this would then have important implications for how we attempt to stop the spread of hiv .\nstrategies such as condom use , while beneficial for reducing the extent of sexual transmission , could thereby enhance the relative benefit of vector transmission , potentially resulting in the evolution of this new route of transmission .\nthe use of antibiotics against bacterial pathogens has clearly brought home the fact that pathogens can readily evolve the means to circumvent our control measures , and there is no reason to expect things to be any different for other control measures .\nthe use of antiviral medication , on the other hand , not only reduces sexual transmission but also the level of viremia , and therefore would presumably not move the selective balance more towards vector transmission .\nit is only by asking these kinds of questions , however , that we will have a chance at preventing adverse future outcomes .\nfinally , the question of biological vector transmission addressed here is really a special case of the more general question of the evolution of a pathogen s host range .\nwhy do some pathogens have a relatively broad taxonomic host range while others are much more conservative ?\nthis continues to be an interesting and important question in the evolutionary ecology of parasites ( poulin 2007 ) and there are some theoretical results predicting when we might expect different outcomes ( gandon 2004 ) . from the standpoint of human diseases\nthis is also clearly an important question since emerging diseases , such as pandemic influenza , are precisely instances in which a pathogen evolves a different host range .\na better understanding of the evolutionary biology of parasite host ranges is an important goal for future research ."}

threatening stress.10 distinct patterns of parental bonding may contribute to the development of different dysfunctional schemas which may influence attitudes toward suicide.19 there are several limitations in this study .\nfirst , we used pbi to assess the child rearing behavior experienced by our participants .\nalthough pbi has shown basic reliability for long periods,20 we could not completely rule out possible influences of the current mood state or recall bias in individuals because pbi is an instrument for measuring recalled parental behaviors .\nsecond , certain parameters were not assessed in this study personality traits , a history of psychiatric disorders , suicidal behavior , and current mood state could affect the attitude towards suicidal behavior . third , because the participants in our study are medical students , we can not generalize these results to general practitioners .\nour study indicated that the majority of participants seriously believe that anyone could commit suicide .\nparticipants who have experienced a higher level of maternal care thought that suicide occurs commonly and tended to think that people do not have the right to commit suicide .\nalthough parental bonding predisposes these attitudes toward suicide , educational programs could change caretaking practices.21 to achieve more positive attitudes towards suicidal behavior , promoting the best practices for suicide prevention is needed for medical students ."}

adherent therapeutic approaches were detected by wide use of ics addition to one or more long - acting bronchodilators .\nmost of the provider s guideline adherence studies have reported the current practices of general practitioners .\na few recent studies have reported similar rates of adherence to guideline recommendations for copd patients ( 37.9%54.7% ) between pulmonologists in other countries.4,5 stage i patients were overtreated with regular long - acting bronchodilators or combination of bronchodilators and icss , while guidelines recommend short - acting bronchodilators as initial therapy . in a study conducted among the pulmonary specialists in italy , corrado and rossi reported that 87.7% of the stage i patients received regular treatment containing long - acting bronchodilators , ics alone , or other treatment combinations of ics plus long - acting bronchodilators.4 in a retrospective database study in the united states , fitch et al reported that only 1% of the stage i patients received ics added to laba and lama , while 6% received ics plus single long - acting bronchodilators , and 76% did not receive any medication in stage i.11 shariff et al reported that 7.7% of the patients in stage i were overtreated and received inappropriate treatment according to the guidelines , in another study on guideline adherence among practitioners and pulmonary specialists.5 in our study , only 14.7% of the patients in stage ii received appropriate therapy , and this was mainly due to overtreatment which was combined long - acting bronchodilators and ics in 77.3% of the patients .\nother reasons for nonadherent therapeutic approaches were single use of ics in 3.4% of the patients and lack of treatment in 3.8% of the patients . other studies found 26%49.2% adherence to gold recommendations in this stage .\novertreatment was 67.3% in one study,4 and lack of copd treatment has been reported in 54% of the patients in another report for stage ii.11 severe and very severe copd patients were treated by the combined use of one or more long - acting bronchodilators and ics which was compliant to gold recommendations .\nthis finding can be explained by the features of this group of patients who are more symptomatic and have more frequent exacerbations .\nsimilar studies on guideline adherence in different countries also reported frequent use of dual and triple therapies in stages iii and iv.4,5,11 the ics was frequently used at all stages ( 43.8% in stage i , 81.5% in stage ii , 89.3% in stage iii , and 87.4% in stage iv ) mostly as a part of combination therapy .\nthis study demonstrates that the pulmonary specialists in turkey have a high tendency to use ics for the treatment of patients with copd . in a study by de miguel - diez et al in spain ,\n34.5% of the patients were prescribed ics , alone or in combination , with a rate of inappropriate use of 18.2%.12 asche et al reported that 33% of the patients received combination treatment containing laba , lama , and/or ics consistent with the current gold guidelines.13 pulmonary specialists in our study mostly preferred to prescribe combination treatments containing ics .\nthis might be related to a number of factors : \n inadequate time with patients , which leads to opting for combination therapies that can provide a broad - spectrum treatment.concerns about symptom control , exacerbation prevention alongside spirometric staging might influence the treatment choice of the specialist.reimbursement of all copd drugs in turkey , making them easily accessible for patients with health insurance.preferring to prescribe drug groups that are effective in the treatment of both asthma and copd , where a differential diagnosis is not available.increasing number of drugs that are provided in combinations and marketing strategies and publicity efforts that promote their use .\ninadequate time with patients , which leads to opting for combination therapies that can provide a broad -

acting bronchodilators such as laba and lama alone remains considerably low , and they have been mostly preferred in stages i , ii , and iii .\nthe most commonly used bronchodilator in monotherapy was lama ( 4.2% ) , and this might be due to its single - dose use and duration of action of more than 24 hours.14,15 this study has several limitations .\nindividual patient data were retrospectively collected through patient records : number of acute exacerbations in the previous year , complete information on comorbidities , adherence to nonpharmacologic interventions were lacking .\ngold guidelines were updated in 2011 to incorporate clinical presentation , including dyspnea as measured by copd assessment test and the modified british medical research council .\nthe updated version of the guidelines incorporates clinical presentation with spirometry findings ( gold 2011).16 this study was undertaken between december 2010 and november 2011 .\nstudy protocol had been designed to evaluate gold 2010 guideline adherence . due to lack of knowledge on dyspnea level ( medical research council scale ) and exacerbation frequency during the last year\neven this new gold classification ( updated in 2011 ) has been changed by considering sypmtoms and exacerbations in addition to spirometric staging , we have not enough data as to the exact superiorities over the old gold classification .\na very recent analysis showed that gold 2011 shifted the overall copd severity distribution to more severe categories .\nthere were nearly three times more copd patients in stage d than in former stage iv ( p<0.05 ) .\nthe predictive capacity for survival up to 10 years was significant for both systems ( p<0.01 ) and gold 2007 and 2011 did not differ significantly . in this study ,\nthe percent predicted fev1 thresholds of 85% , 55% , and 35% were found better to stage copd severity for mortality , which are similar to the ones used previously in the gold 2010 classification . increasing intensity of treatment of patients with copd according to their gold 2011 reclassification\nis not known to improve health outcomes.17 the classification recommended by the gold committee since 2011 does not seem to be adopted universally throughout europe .\neven if there is a real improvement over the previous classification due to taking into account clinical criteria , quality of life , and exacerbations , criticisms have arisen concerning the choice of certain pathways and therapeutic recommendations not based on prospective studies with a high level of evidence.18 at the national level , we do not have any published data on the adoption of the new gold 2011 classification . according to the previously mentioned obstacles of the new classification , and lack of the knowledge about the frequency of new gold 2011 classification use , instead of the gold 2010 .\nwe believe this data on the guideline adherence among pulmonologists may still reflect the current attitude toward the routine approach of the diagnosis and therapies of copd in turkey , and also is concordant with the real life situation around the world .\nturkish thoracic society has published an updated report of copd prevention , diagnosis and treatment in 2014,19 and included in the global alliance against chronic respiratory disease ( gard ) with the ministry of health.20 the improvement of adherence to national and international copd guidelines may be achieved by continuing medical education supported by national thoracic societies . increased awareness of guidelines may influence the standardized care of copd patients , and will have prognostic influences .\npromotion of the compliance to evidence - based medicine by health authorities may have also positive effects on the attitude change in the real - life applications .\nthis study showed that the pulmonary specialists in turkey have low rates of adherence to gold guidelines for treatment of stable copd patients .\nmajor improper approaches were overtreatment in early stages and excessive use of inhaler corticosteroids in all stages of disease .\nnew strategies are needed to achieve a standardized approach for the treatment of copd , and thus to improve adherence to guideline recommendations , with particular focus on treatment indications and overtreatment in turkey ."}

6 hours .\npotential nephrotoxic medications , namely acyclovir , corticosteroids , calcineurin inhibitors ( cyclosporine ) , vancomycin , loop diuretics ( furosemide ) , and aminoglycosides ( amikacin ) , were given to 38 ( 95% ) , 28 ( 70% ) , 21 ( 52.5% ) , 19 ( 47.5% ) , 5 ( 12.5% ) , and 1 ( 2.5% ) patients , respectively .\nin contrast , spironolactone and sodium bicarbonate as potential nephroprotective agents were administered to 7 ( 17.5% ) and 4 ( 10% ) individuals , respectively .\nno patient received cisplatin , ifosfamide , cyclophosphamide , dopamine , and mannitol during the study period .\nthe mean  sd daily oral / intravenous sodium supplementation administered in conjunction with the amb treatment was 124.75  62.15 meq . during the study ,\n11 ( 27.5% ) and 21 ( 52.5% ) patients developed amb nephrotoxicity and atn , respectively .\nthe mean  sd onset of amb nephrotoxicity was 6.73  2.36 days . in accordance with the univariate analysis , amb indication ( p = 0.259 ) , vancomycin co - administration ( p = 0.388 ) , duration of liposomal amb infusion ( p = 0.141 ) , and amount of oral / intravenous sodium supplementation ( p = 0.375 )\nbased on this model , none of these variables were significantly associated with amb nephrotoxicity ( table 2 ) .\namb administration was discontinued permanently in 2 individuals who developed nephrotoxicity , and they underwent emergent hemodialysis .\nthere was no statistically significant difference in the duration of hospitalization between the patients with and without amb nephrotoxicity ( 27.72  4.81 and 30.33  13.57 days , respectively ; p = 0.541 ) .\nthe mortality rate was also comparable between the patients with ( 54.54% ) and without ( 48.27% ) amb nephrotoxicity ( p = 0.723 ) .\nthe mean  sd onset of hypokalemia during amb administration was 5.06  3.35 days .\nonly one documented episode of hypomagnesemia was detected in the study population during the amb treatment .\nconsidering the fact that serum magnesium levels were not measured routinely for most of the patients , determining the rate of renal magnesium wasting was not feasible .\nthe co - administration of neither loop ( p = 0.642 ) nor potassium - sparing diuretics ( p = 0.211 ) was significantly associated with hypokalemia .\nthe mean  se daily amounts of intravenous potassium and magnesium administered during the course of the amb treatment were 52.43  12.13 and 3.51  2.04 meq , respectively .\nthe incidence ( 27.5% ) and time onset ( 5.06  3.35 days ) of amb nephrotoxicity in the present study were within the ranges reported in the literature .\nsome degree of increase in serum creatinine has been detected within 2 weeks in up to 80% of patients who received amb ( 9 , 10 ) . in one of the most prominent studies in this regard\n, a 9-year retrospective analysis demonstrated that 138 ( 28% ) of 494 adult in - patients experienced some type of nephrotoxicity during amb treatment ( 10 ) . in a 1-year prospective observational study by tavakoli - ardakani et al .\n( 15 ) in the hematology - oncology and stem cell transplantation wards at taleghani hospital in tehran , 9 ( 25.71% ) out of 35 patients developed an increase in serum creatinine and bun during the course of amb treatment .\nthis rate was reported to be 27.8% at another referral hematology - oncology and stem cell transplantation center in tehran ( 16 ) . in the adult infectious diseases ward at imam khomeini hospital in tehran , khalili et al .\n( 17 ) demonstrated that 10 ( 76.92% ) of 13 individuals receiving amb alone developed acute kidney injury ( aki ) ; however , the incidence of aki among the patients given amb along with ceftriaxone and/or vancomycin was 86.68% .\nthe time onset of amb nephrotoxicity was not generally reported in the aforementioned iranian studies .\nthe wide variations in the incidence of amb nephrotoxicity noted above could be due to different study methodologies , clinical settings , relevant risk factors , and definitions .\nnotably , 62.5% of the individuals in our study were given liposomal amb , which has a considerably less nephrotoxic formulation .\nthis could partially justify the relatively lower rate of amb nephrotoxicity in our cohort than in similar studies in iran . in the present study , amb nephrotoxicity in 45.45% of the affected patients resolved spontaneously without any intervention .\nonly 2 patients in our cohort required emergency hemodialysis due to the severity and persistency of amb nephrotoxicity .\nit has been reported that amb nephrotoxicity is predominantly reversible within a few months after discontinuation of treatment ( 18 ) ; however , about 15% of affected patients may require renal replacement therapy such as dialysis ( 19 ) . in the shariati hematology - oncology and stem cell transplantation wards , hayatshahi et al .\n( 16 ) showed that amb nephrotoxicity led to a dose reduction of this agent in 3.7% of cases . in terms of clinical outcomes , mortality and duration of hospitalization were comparable between patients with and without amb nephrotoxicity in the present population .\nin contrast , bates et al.s ( 20 ) study of a large population ( 707 adults ) in the united states reported that acute renal failure due to amb increased the mean length of hospital stay by 8.2 days ( p < 0.0001 ) and increased the total cost of treatment by $ 29,823 .\nthe mortality rate was also much higher ( 54% vs. 16% ; p = 0.001 ) .\ndifferences in the confounding factors ( e.g. , the severity of the underlying disease ) , the type of amb formulation used ( conventional vs. lipid - based ) , and sample size could partially account for these disparities .\nwe considered p values greater than 0.05 ( 0.4 ) in the univariate analysis to select all possible variables linked to the dependent variable . among the different demographic , clinical , and paraclinical features , amb indication , vancomycin co - administration , duration of liposomal amb infusion , and amount of oral / intravenous sodium supplementation\nnevertheless , none of these variables were significantly associated with amb nephrotoxicity in the multivariate logistic regression model .\nseveral large - scale retrospective and prospective studies have identified males , an average daily dose of amb above 35 mg , a cumulative dose of amb greater than 2 - 5 g , dehydration , co - administered diuretics and nephrotoxic agents ( e.g. , aminoglycosides , cyclosporine , foscarnet , cisplatin , and ifosfamide ) or corticosteroids , and baseline renal dysfunction as potential risk factors for amb nephrotoxicity ( 21 - 23 ) .\ninadequate statistical power resulting from the relatively small sample size and the relatively low incidence of amb nephrotoxicity due to the administration of liposomal amb appear to be the main reasons for our findings in this regard .\nit has been suggested that conventional amb should preferably not be administered to patients with two or more of the aforementioned risk factors of amb nephrotoxicity ( 10 , 24 ) .\nnotwithstanding , with the introduction of considerably less nephrotoxic formulations of amb into the market , this suggestion does not seem to make sense in clinical practice . during the course of the amb treatment in the current study ,\nhypokalemia and renal potassium wasting developed in 45% and 27.5% of the patients , respectively . in contrast , hypomagnesemia was detected in only 1 patient ( 2.5% ) .\nthe incidence of amb - induced hypokalemia in our cohort was lower than that reported in the literature ( 75% - 90% ) ( 25 ) .\nthis may be due to the fact that 62.5% of the patients in the present study received liposomal amb .\nseveral publications have estimated the frequency of amb - induced hypomagnesemia to be between 15% and 100% depending on the dose and formulation of amb ( 26 ) .\napart from the type of amb formulation and the presence of relevant risk factors , such as the co - administration of loop and potassium - sparing diuretics , the low rate of hypomagnesemia in our population could have been because the patients serum magnesium levels were measured only once a week during the amb treatment in the studied wards .\nsevere hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia due to amb can cause metabolic complications , rhabdomyolysis , and life - threatening arrhythmias ( 25 ) ; however , these adverse events were not observed in our cohort at least during the course of the amb treatment . in conclusion ,\nnearly one - third ( 27.5% ) of our cohort developed nephrotoxicity within the first week of amb treatment .\namb nephrotoxicity resolved spontaneously in about half ( 45.45% ) of the affected patients without any intervention .\nmortality and the duration of hospitalization were comparable between patients with and without amb nephrotoxicity .\nno studied demographic , clinical , and paraclinical features of the study population were significantly associated with amb nephrotoxicity . among the studied electrolyte abnormalities , hypokalemia and renal potassium wasting were the most notable , affecting about one - half and one - third of amb recipients , respectively .\nthe co - administration of either loop or potassium - sparing diuretics did not significantly affect electrolyte abnormalities during the course of the amb treatment .\nclose monitoring of renal function indexes , including serum creatinine , bun , serum potassium , and magnesium , during amb treatment is highly recommended .\nadditionally , implementing approved prophylactic measures , such as saline loading ( 150 meq / day ) before and/or during amb infusion , and exploiting lipid - based formulations of amb ( especially liposomal ) , if available and affordable , should be considered to minimize the possibility of amb nephrotoxicity ."}

residue which was h - reduced , while all the other sugars were h reduced .\ntherefore , galnac can be considered as the protein bound sugar . the high amount of 4-o - me - gal indicated that this residue is the one which is mainly involved in the elongation of the glycan .\nminor compounds were identified as contaminations by n -

glycan distribution in selected snail species given in [ % ] of total o - glycans .\ncompositions are given in terms of hexose ( hex ) , methylated hexose ( mehex ) , n - acetylhexosamine ( hexnac ) and deoxyhexose ( fucose ; dhex ) analyzing snails in detail , it was obvious that the o - glycan trisaccharide core is an important decoration of snail proteins in all investigated species . in five of the analyzed snails ( a. lusitanicus , a. fulica , h. pomatia , l. maximus , c. helena ) this glycan was the most abundant type of o - glycan .\nb. glabrata and c. hortensis displayed as their main glycan the trisaccharide elongated by one or two unmethylated hexoses , respectively .\nonly p. corneus was an exception possessing a large amount of hex4hexnac glycan . whereas the addition of one hexose to the core was relatively frequent , larger structures were minor compounds or were even not present in several species .\nthe only detected amino sugar was galnac which provided in all cases the connection to the protein .\ngal and man were present in unmethylated or mono - methylated ( 3-o - me - gal , 4-o - me - gal , 3-o - me - man ) versions .\nfucose , which had been identified as such in previous works [ 23 , 28 ] , occurred only in low amounts and was detected linked to galnac as well as to terminal sugar residues by ms / ms fragmentation .\nduring the last decades our knowledge on glycosylation processes - structure of the glycans and the corresponding biochemical pathways including the responsible enzymes - increased enormously , especially for glycans of mammalian origin .\nthe glycosylation capabilities of other species were only under investigation if their glycans were for any reason connected with human life ( e.g. some recognition processes of pathogens or allergy on food or plant glycans ) or if they were potent candidates for cell culture systems for the expression of therapeutics ( some insect , yeast and plant cells ) .\nin the meantime more and more invertebrate systems are investigated because of their potential usefulness for biotechnological reasons or to get some deeper insights into the processing pathways of unusual glycan structures .\nprevious studies on various invertebrates showed that glycosylation has a lot more varieties than we expected as long as only mammals were investigated , but the data are scattered .\nstill the main focus is laid on n - glycans but the interest in o - glycans is growing .\na number of difficulties arose during snail glycan analysis due to the tough tissue , which was not easy to homogenize and the rigid mucus , which had to be discarded diligently .\nthe removal of storage carbohydrates , which might influence monosaccharide analysis and the separation of n- and o - glycans were other struggles to resolve . while the first was done by -glucosidase digestion from rice , the latter was an even more difficult task .\nn - glycosidases ( pngase a and f ) did not remove the n - glycans completely and even mild -elimination conditions seemed to be able to release , at least in part , residual n - glycans which resulted in n - glycan impurities in o - glycan fractions .\nfurthermore some n - glycans of snails and digested storage glycans are so small ( 45 sugar residues [ 16 , 17 ] ) that they may co - migrate on hplc with o - glycans\n. therefore only a limited number of glycans could be prepared in terms of sufficient amount and purity for permethylation followed by maldi - tof - ms and gc - ms linkage analysis .\nhowever , in combination with lc - esi - ms of native glycans which is capable of a high throughput of samples the o - glycan pattern of 8 snail species ( land snails with shell : achatina fulica , cepaea hortensis and helix pomatia ; slugs : arion lusitanicus and limax maximus ; water snails : biomphalaria glabrata , clea helena , and planorbarius corneus ) could be identified .\nfour monosaccharide constituents  galnac , gal , man and fuc  are the building blocks of the structures .\nthe only further modification is a methylation of the hexoses , resulting in 3-o - me - gal , 4-o - me - gal and 3-o - me - man , which has already been shown for snail n - glycans [ 1417 , 23 ] .\neach o - glycan contains only one amino sugar , which is the protein linked galnac .\nthe linkage amino acid was not determined in detail , but due to the easy release by -elimination the common galnac - ser / thr motif is very likely .\nthe connection to other amino acids , for example tyrosine , is usually more stable . in snail o - glycans the inner galnac\nis frequently elongated by two 4-o - me - gal residues in ( 13)- and ( 16)-linkage . elongations of this trisaccharide core by one or two hexoses with or without methyl group appeared in most snail species , whereas further elongation or fucosylation are rare events .\ninsects , one neighbor of mollusks in the phylogenetic tree , display also internal galnac elongated by one gal in their o - glycan structures , but further elongations and/or branching are frequently done by another amino sugar ( galnac or glcnac ) .\nthe main o - glycans of toxocara canis are trisaccharides consisting of galnac , gal or 4-o - gal and 2-o - fuc .\nso far nothing is known about biological functions of snail glycans . for sure these glycans\nare similarly involved in recognition processes as they are in all other species , but especially the significance of the high degree of methylation of hexoses of n- as well as of o - glycans is waiting for elucidation . here\nwe enlarge the current knowledge on glycosylation abilities of lower animals by presenting the first o - glycan analysis of snails , representatives of the mollusk phylum ."}

regulatory response to protect against further inflammation and atherosclerosis ( 26 ) .\nfindings of positive correlation between adiponectin and culprit lesion necrotic core ( nc ) content is consistent with the hypothesis that in advanced cad , serum adiponectin levels are elevated in a counter - regulatory response ( 27 ) .\nhigh serum adiponectin levels , instead of being protective , have been shown to be associated with increased mortality and adverse event rates .\nthis paradoxical relation is further supported by study that included patients undergoing pci for symptomatic cad ( 28 ) . despite the potential association between heart failure and high plasma adiponectin shown by several clinical studies ,\nother experimental studies have demonstrated a beneficial , protective effect of adiponectin on myocardium . elevated plasma levels of adiponectin among patients with heart failure\nfurthermore , several statins are also effective for elevating plasma adiponectin ( 29 , 30 ) .\nthere were no significant differences in plasma concentrations of adiponectin between patients with stable angina pectoris ( sap ) and control patients ( 11.3 v 12.8 g / ml ) ( 31 ) .\nour study findings were similar to this study , where plasma concentrations of adiponectin between patients with sap and control group ( 3.45 v 3.49 g / ml ) had no significant differences . in the present study ,\npatients in our sap group had already been receiving some treatment with antianginal and antiatherosclerotic drugs .\nas certain medical treatments may confound interpretation of plasma concentrations of adiponectin measurements and there may not be significant differences in plasma concentrations of adiponectin between patients with sap and control patients .\nanother important clinical finding showed that plasma concentrations of adiponectin were considerably increased in older and female patients with cad ( 31 ) .\nas a consequence of their findings they suggested that unstable plaque may stabilize as the patient grows older or that accumulation of adiponectin in atherosclerotic vascular walls may suppress its elimination half - life from plasma , resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of adiponectin in older patients with cad . although a significant relation between serum adiponectin levels and age was not found in our study , it is known that age has an effect on serum adiponectin levels and that there is a positive relationship between age and serum adiponectin level ( 32 ) .\nincluding both individuals with and without cardiovascular disease , higher adiponectin has protecting role in those without cardiovascular disease and predictive of worse outcomes in those with existing disease ( 33 ) .\nmoreover , it has been suggested that normal and even higher serum adiponectin levels may prevent the development of cardiovascular diseases and complications in healthy individuals ( 34 ) .\nmale patients with hypoadiponectinemia ( < 4.0 g / ml ) had a two - fold increase in cad prevalence , independent of well - known cad risk factors ( 35 ) .\nsimilar to our study in male gender with hypoadiponectinemia ( < 2.0 g / ml ) increase the odds of having cad ( table 6 ) . our current study did not show a significant correlation between bmi and cad ( p - value 0.115 ) , despite the presence of significant association between whr and cad ( p - value= 0,0001 ) .\nthis may be explained by the fact that bmi quantifies general adiposity , although person who is overweight or obese is likely to have excess fat but bmi does not give an indication as to how this fat is distributed in the body .\nhowever , fat distribution is an important determinant of cad independent of bmi and other classic risk factors of cad ( 36 ) .\nwelborn and dhaliwal ( 37 ) and srikanthan , seeman , and karlamangla ( 38 ) confirmed , and cited several other investigations that show whr being the superior clinical measurement for predicting all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality .\nwelborn and dhaliwal added that the hip circumference indicated a lower risk for body fat accumulation , and thus including it into the waist - to - hip equation enhances the accuracy of this measurement technique .\nrelatively small sample of patients that were selected randomly from the general population , may have limited the ability to detect significant relationship between adiponectin and coronary artery disease , thus making it difficult to indicate the results to the general population .\nthere is a significant positive correlation between waist - hip ratio and severity of coronary artery disease .\nalso , there is a significant positive correlation between adiponectin and gensini score among kosovar patients ."}

old patient who had lid laxity preoperatively and showed ectropion postoperatively , which may be due to scar contracture . and\ntwo patients ( 3.7% ) had mild hyperpigmentation at the lateral canthal incision site even after six months postoperatively .\nbut most of patients showed hardly visible scar in the lateral canthal area ( fig .\nalthough subciliary incision with lateral eyebrow incision ( dingman 's approach ) is the most common approach to the zygomatic complex ( 7 , 10 ) , it can leave a visible scar and ectropion of the lower eyelid .\nfactors predisposing to an eyelid retraction and ectropion include hematoma , eyelid edema , adhesions of the orbital septum , scar contracture , horizontal laxity of the eyelid margin , weakening of the pretarsal muscle , and wide dissection of the anterior periosteum ( 11 ) . to decrease the complication rates of the subciliary approach , many authors have tried to treat zygoma complex fracture repair using the transconjunctival approach ( 1 , 6 - 9 ) .\nthey emphasized the advantage of this approach over the dingman 's approach , in terms of minimal ectropion , hidden scars , and minimal lid lymphedema . in the transconjunctival approach\n, the dissection can be performed in one of two separate planes ; preseptal approach and retroseptal approach .\nsome authors ( 12 , 13 ) advocated that the retroseptal approach is preferred because it can be performed easily and the integrity between orbital septum and orbicularis oculi muscle is not disturbed .\nhowever , the retroseptal approach has increased risk of injury to the inferior oblique muscle and prolapse of orbital fat into the surgical field ( 10 , 11 ) .\nhence , all our patients were treated with the transconjunctival preseptal approach . in the management of the lateral canthal extension site , manson et al .\n( 9 ) advocated that the canthal reattachment is not required in an acute fracture treatment but is necessary in fractures when treatment is delayed , in patients with established canthal deformities , or in patients in whom a simultaneous coronal incision is employed . according to them ,\nthe anterior limb of the lateral canthal tendon which is also referred to as the superficial lateral canthal tendon by other authors ( 14 ) , is continuous to the temporal fascia and galea aponeurotica and the diffuse connections of this limb facilitate proper positioning of the canthus after mobilization of the posterior limb ( deep lateral canthal tendon ) .\nthe current authors think that in addition to some indications mentioned above , patients of old age with lid laxity also needs lateral canthal reattachments or canthopexy .\nits significance began to be considered following our case of a 78 yr - old patient who developed persistent ectropion when canthal reattachment had not been performed .\nthe precise physical stability of the zygoma with respect to the number and location of miniplates applied is not known , because it depends on fracture anatomy , extent , and the amount of displacement .\nsome laboratory studies , using human cadaver heads , have been conducted to investigate the stability of fixated zygoma . in 1989 , rinehart et al .\n( 15 ) simulated noncomminuted zygoma fractures in eight human cadaver heads and the stability of fracture fixation was studied for various fixation patterns . in their study ,\ndouble - miniplate fixation across the zygomaticofrontal and zygomaticomaxillary fracture lines is sufficient to withstand static and oscillating loading similar to physiologic masticatory forces . in 1990 , davidson et al .\n( 16 ) analyzed different methods of internal fixation of simple displaced fractures of the zygoma in an attempt to define the simplest method of achieving postreduction stability . in their report , the three - point fixation ( frontozygomatic suture , inferior orbital rim , and zygomaticomaxillary buttress ) using either miniplates alone or interfragmentary wiring conferred the greatest stability .\nin addition , they proposed that the two - point fixation using miniplate alone conferred a degree of stability comparable to most methods of three - point fixation regardless of the site in which the miniplates were applied .\nwe concur with the above assertions and think that two - point miniplate fixation at the infraorbital rim and zygomaticofrontal suture would suffice , provided the comminution of the zygoma is not severe .\nalthough not the focus of our attention in this study , in case of severely comminuted fracture , three - point fixation through the transconjunctival incision and gingivobuccal incision is preferably performed . to fixate the fracture site and provide stability , we used four hole resorbable 2.0-mm miniplates systems , macrosorb ( macropore , san diego , ca , u.s.a . ) in most patients , and titanium miniplates ( osteomed , dalllas , tx , u.s.a . ) only when there was a segmental fracture at the infraorbital rim or when requested by the patient due to the lighter financial burden .\nin addition to the inconspicuous scarring , the main advantage of this method is a direct and full visualization of the lateral and inferior orbital wall to be served as a guidance for an accurate reduction , which makes the reduction more successful .\nthe only drawback we experienced in our method is a little difficulty in reducing the fracture - displaced zygoma because of limited space and a slightly inadequate vector for the elevator .\nusually a fractured zygoma is displaced and rotated posteriorly and medially , so an anterior - lateral pull is required .\nhowever , the lateral canthal incision is located medially to the zygoma body and lateral pulling of the zygoma body may be a little difficult . in conclusion\n, we believe that the proposed technique is very useful for the treatment of zygomatic complex fracture which is not severely comminuted , because it provides excellent exposure and postoperative stability of the zygoma with a lower incidence of complications , including visible scarring and ectropion ."}

assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ) .\na 38-year - old man was admitted to our hospital with a 2 days history of fever , malaise and cellulitis around a mitrofanoff abdominal catheter .\nmultiple comorbidities included marfan syndrome ( with metallic aortic valve inserted sixteen years before ) and congenital urological abnormalities that led to the mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy and a recent renal transplant , five years and six months before admission respectively .\nhe was on steroids and tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy . on presentation , the patient was febrile , hypotensive and tachycardic , had a normal leukocyte count ( 5.0910/l ) but raised creactive protein ( crp ) 45\nmg / l with mild anaemia ( hb of 10.1 g / dl from a baseline of 14.6 g / dl ) and renal impairment ( creatinine 163 umol / l and urea 8.1 mmol / l ) .\nthe cellulitis around the mitrofanoff abdominal catheter was noted and a swab was taken for culture .\nhis chest x - ray did not show any relevant consolidation and abdominal ultrasound noted two small abdominal collections that had already been noted post - transplant and had since decreased in size .\nthe patient was documented to be penicillin allergic ( previous skin rash ) , so was initiated on ertapenem iv 1 gr / od . the cellulitis improved and the patient was clinically well within 48 hours of commencing antibiotics .\nthe blood culture set ( aerobic and anaerobic bottles ) taken on admission was positive with p. multocida but the abdominal swab grew only mixed anaerobes .\nurine culture was negative and all subsequent blood cultures taken after starting ertapenem were negative after 5 days of incubation .\ntransesophageal ( tee ) echocardiography revealed the presence of a vegetation ( 0.57 0.2 cm ) above the atrium of the right coronary artery .\na previous transthoracic echocardiogram ( tte ) , around one month prior to admission , was reported as negative .\ntherefore , the patient was treated following our local protocol for infective endocarditis : he was switched to ceftriaxone iv 2 gr / od , a picc line was inserted in the right arm and he was discharged under the opat ( outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy ) service to complete six weeks iv antibiotics as an outpatient . on follow - up , two repeat ttes showed clear aortic valve .\nwe reviewed all the previous reported cases of p. multocida endocarditis in the literature through pubmed and cross - references search .\nto our knowledge this is the twenty - first reported case of endocarditis but the first to be reported in a penicillin allergic patient . as with previous cases ,\nthe diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made according to duke criteria : one major criterion ( evidence of endocardial involvement ) and three minor criteria ( predisposing heart condition , fever and microbiological evidence with positive blood culture ) .\nlaboratory isolation and identification of p. multocida was performed using standard microbiological techniques : api-20ne , api-20e ( biomerieux ) and the phoenix automated system ( bd ) .\ninterestingly , both api profiles reported a low confidence value for identification as p. multocida to the species level ( cv 53% ) and the phoenix assay only identified the isolate to genus level as pasteurella spp . thus , confirmation of species identification was performed using 16s rrna sequencing and maldi - tof protein profiling : 16s rrna sequence was performed using pcr parameters detailed in maskell na et al .\n( 2006 ) and we obtained a 584bp fragment sharing 99% sequence homology to that of p. multocida sub species septica .\nmaldi - tof profiling was performed using a bruker daltonics microflex platform with recommended -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix under pre - defined conditions as specified by bruker .\nthe maldi - tof mass spectra for the clinical isolate was analysed against maldi -

trimoxazole 0.032 , ertapenem 0.016 and ceftriaxone < 0.016 , all being susceptible . of note\nthe accuracy of previous reports in the literature has been questioned as their standard microbiological description was incomplete and pasteurella species may be misidentified as haemophilus spp .\nthey both belong to the pasteurellaceae family and based on the genomic sequence it appears they diverged approximately 270 million years ago .\nare gram - negative coccobacilli generally present in the oral cavity of cats and dogs . to date twenty - one species\nhave been identified and the species p. multocida can be further divided into three different subspecies ( subspecies multocida , septicum and gallicida ) .\nthe spectrum of infections varies from skin and soft tissue to central nervous system infections .\nten out of twenty - one ( 47.6% ) endocarditis cases described in the literature had close contact with animals detailed in the clinical history .\nour patient did not have a clear history of bites or scratches but he did have two cats at home and close contact with dogs at his sister 's house .\nin fact , of the cases of p. multocida endocarditis reviewed , two out of twenty - one ( 9.5% ) had cirrhosis as underlying condition .\npenicillin still remains the best antimicrobial agent for the treatment of virtually all forms of pasteurella infection .\na fluoroquinolone , doxycycline , or co - trimoxazole should be considered for skin and soft tissue infections as an alternative for patients with intolerance to -lactams . there are no clear guidelines about the treatment of p. multocida endocarditis in penicillin - allergic patients .\nthe patient was known to be penicillin allergic ( previous rash ) and ciprofloxacin and doxycycline were contraindicated as causing interaction with his anticoagulant treatment .\nwe decided then to switch to ceftriaxone as this antibiotic is already vastly used in the treatment of endocarditis caused by other gram - negative organisms and is more cost effective .\naminoglycosides have moderate to poor in vitro activity against pasteurella and probably should not be used , particularly given the paucity of clinical experience . finally , our patient improved within 48 hours of commencing antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention was unnecessary . from the literature ,\nonly three other cases have been successfully treated with solely antibiotics and valve replacement was mandatory in seventeen out of twenty - one ( 81% ) of cases described .\nclinicians may face various challenges , from achieving the correct species identification to chosing treatment regimens in penicillin - allergic patients . in our case new diagnostic techniques such as 16s rrna sequencing and maldi - tof were demonstrated to be invaluable tools for species confirmation .\nwe propose that maldi - tof is a rapid , accurate method for the identification of p. multocida from bacterial cultures and can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis of p. multocida bacteraemia .\nfurthermore we have shown that cephalosporins and carbapenems are probably good substitutes for penicillin in case of allergy ."}

dose ct scan , thereby shortening the total scanning time substantially .\nnow that the method has been shown to produce high - quality parametric images , its implementation into clinical practice needs investigation . using the described parametric imaging approach\n, the present study demonstrated that atf was relatively constant independent of tissue characteristics of the myocardium . only in ( near )\ntransmurally infarcted segments was atf significantly reduced , most likely due to wall thinning , as atf is prone to partial volume effects . in contrast , ptf and pti progressively decreased with increasing extent of scarring , as shown by lge cmr .\nthese results are in line with those of previous studies in which reductions in both ptf and pti were observed in nonviable scarred myocardium .\npti in control segments appeared to be somewhat lower than the expected value of unity for normal segments ( 0.91    0.08 ) .\nthis phenomenon has previously been observed in cardiomyopathy in both animal experiments and human studies [ 6 , 20 ] .\nslight misalignment between pet and cmr segments may have occurred to additionally account for this reduction in pti .\nfurthermore , the presence of interstitial fibrosis in dilated cardiomyopathy may also explain this reduction in \nnormal segments that remains undetected on lge cmr [ 21 , 22 ] . taking lge as a reference , the optimal cut - off values for discriminating between viable and nonviable myocardium\nalthough this would reduce the data processing time , it would not affect the scanning protocol , as for both parameters a dynamic [ o]h2o pet scan in combination with a low - dose ct scan are required .\nin addition , the sensitivity of pti exceeded that of ptf ( 91  % and 68  % , respectively ) , whereas for specificity the opposite pattern was observed ( 73  % and 78  % , respectively ) .\nalthough further study is need to determine the cause of this discrepancy , as a potential clinical marker of viability pti may be favoured over ptf to reduce false - negative findings in patients who might benefit from revascularization .\nit is of interest to note that , compared to ptf and pti , mbf performed relatively poorly in distinguishing viable from nonviable tissue , rendering it less suitable for viability imaging .\nprevious studies have indicated that the optimal cut - off value for pti is in the range 0.70.9 .\nlge was used as a surrogate end - point of myocardial viability instead of functional recovery of dysfunctional myocardium after revascularization .\nlge has been shown to be a good , but not perfect , marker of myocardial viability [ 15 , 17 ] .\ntherefore , the results should be interpreted with caution , and more studies are warranted to establish the value of parametric pti as a viability marker .\nptf and pti , obtained from a single [ o]h2o pet / ct scan , can be used as markers of myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease .\nptf and pti , obtained from a single [ o]h2o pet / ct scan , can be used as markers of myocardial viability in patients with coronary artery disease .\nthis article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license which permits any use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original author(s ) and the source are credited ."}
{"id": 106, "text": "while advances in free trade and globalization increase the movement and accelerate the accumulation of invasive species ( lockwood et al .\n2005 ) , it is still unclear how introduced populations can successfully establish . as elton ( 1958 ) pointed out , for every successful invasion that occurs ,  there are enormously more invasions that never happen , or fail quite soon or even after a good many years ( page 109 ) .\nthis modern biological paradox can not readily be reconciled , especially in the characteristic case where the founder population is small , as  such populations are definitely in a precarious position ( mayr 1965 ; page 42 ) .\nintroductions of populations at low density and/or small size are often faced with inverse density dependent effects , attributed to demographic stochasticity or reduced cooperative interactions ( courchamp et al .\nallee ( 1931 ) first proposed that under these conditions , populations may suffer a decrease in the per - capita rate of increase , from here on referred to as the allee effect . upon arrival in a novel environment , individuals need to overcome a series of challenges in order to reduce the population 's risk of extinction .\nthe time period in which this occurs is generally considered the initial establishment phase , and is thought to be a common feature and general pattern of invasion and the process of growth and expansion ( shigesada and kawasaki 1997 ; sakai et al .\nthe occurrence of a lag phase that precedes a noticeable increase in population growth and density can result from ecological and/or evolutionary phenomena ( sakai et al .\nsmall populations that undergo logistic growth slowly increase through the initial phase of the exponential curve , leading to the perception of a time lag .\nwhere this time lag is more pronounced , populations may be recovering from inverse density dependent effects ( i.e. , allee effects ) .\nindividuals may suffer a reduction in fitness at low densities for many reasons ( reviewed by courchamp et al .\neven when the initial population is large , rapid dispersal required for expansion could be suicidal as the population density decreases , thereby enhancing inverse density dependent effects ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ; drake et al .\ncomponent allee effect where the population size and density affects the mean overall fitness or some component of individual fitness , respectively ( stephens et al . 1999 ; gascoigne et al .\nit is often difficult to decipher the exact mechanism that manifests allee effects ( and it is not always the case that component allee effects lead to demographic allee effects ) .\nnevertheless , we focus our attention on population level demographic allee effects with the underlying assumption that a component allee effect led to the demographic allee effect . essentially , it is the case that introduced individuals may be maladapted to small population sizes where their survival and reproductive ability are significantly impacted , and these impacts on individual fitness combine to produce an overall decrease in abundance ( i.e. , demographic allee effects ) . as allee effects impact individual fitness , the underlying traits that influence these effects (\ni.e. , component allee effects ) may be subject to natural selection ( courchamp et al . 2008 ) . whereas propagule pressure is an emerging explanation for the establishment of invasive species ( lockwood et al . 2005 ) , it relies on an obvious relationship between the number and size of introduction events and the probability of success , as safety in numbers helps combat allee effects and stochastic extinction . in the event that propagule size is not large enough to overcome inverse density dependent effects , a population\ntraits that may be responsible for reproductive success and survival at small population densities and sizes include mate finding cues ( pheromones and vocal / visual signals ) , dispersal / aggregation behavior , habitat preferences , mating synchronicity , and gamete morphology and performance ( see courchamp et al .\ndirect evidence for the evolution of these traits as functional adaptations to allee effects is limited , but we can infer an adaptive evolutionary origin of these traits from studies of sexual selection ( courchamp et al . 2008 ; gascoigne et al .\nan evolutionary response to intensive selection pressure imposed by density dependent survival and reproduction relies on genetic variants for adaptive evolution .\naccording to neutral quantitative genetic theory , a loss of genetic variation is expected from population bottlenecks and founder effects ( nei et al .\nhowever it is not neutral variation that matters , but rather evolvability depends on the variation relevant to selection .\nmaintenance or even increases of this ( additive ) genetic variation has been theoretically and empirically observed following a bottleneck or in small founder populations ( bryant et al .\n1986 ; goodnight 1988 ; willis and orr 1993 ; cheverud and routman 1996 ; briggs and goldman 2006 ; turelli and barton 2006 ) .\nadditionally , many recent studies suggest that there is actually no significant reduction in genetic diversity in most successful invaders ( lee 2002 ; allendorf and lundquist 2003 ; roman and darling 2007 and references therein ) , and that evolution can occur on contemporary timescales ( reznick and ghalambor 2001 ; carroll et al . 2007 ; kinnison and hairston 2007 ) .\nour purpose here is to explore the feasibility of small populations that may adaptively respond to overcome allee effects in order to establish , given any amount of genetic variation . in this paper\n, we present evidence for the enhanced potential for growth and spread of a small introduced population of organisms faced with allee effects when adaptation occurs .\nwe model the growth and spread of this population according to a reaction - diffusion equation , and allow evolution to influence inverse density dependent effects through a genetic subsystem that provides the opportunity for successful invasion when otherwise ( under the current , ecological paradigm ) the population would go extinct .\nthe deterministic model that we explore in this paper broadly describes population dynamics with density - mediated growth ( i.e. , an allee effect ) and diffusive dispersal .\nthis type of demographic model has been used as a compact and tractable representation of invasion ( e.g. , skellam 1951 ; lewis and kareiva 1993 ) .\nspecifically , it has been applied to systems such as introductions of nonindigenous freshwater and marine species through ballast water discharge ( drake et al .\n2005 ; drury et al . 2007 ) . using this approach , drake et al .\n( 2005 ) report acceptable volumes of discharge for various organisms ( with differing reproductive rates ) for a range of invasion risk tolerances . here\n, we consider populations that are introduced below the invasion risk threshold , but nonetheless succeed if evolutionary dynamics are considered in conjunction with the ecological system .\nthe growth and spread of an introduced population of organisms is represented by a reaction - diffusion equation described by ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ) : which determines the rate of change in the local population density relative to the carrying capacity [ u which denotes u(x , t ) ] over time , at a point in space .\nthis equation models the growth of the population ( the first term on the right hand side of eqn .\n1 ) at a spatial location that is subject to an allee effect in addition to migration ( which depends on the second term on the rhs of eqn .\n1 ) . the diffusion coefficient ( d ) scales the rate of population spread , in this case across a one - dimensional habitat x. the reproductive rate is regulated by r , and a ( which is a function of space and time , derived below ) is the local critical density or allee threshold that determines if population growth is positive or negative ( fig .\ngrowth dynamics of the model population ( a ) , and the solution of eqn .\n( 1 ) without diffusion ( b ) with reproductive rate , r = 0.6 , and allee threshold , a = 0.3 .\ntrajectories for population size ( b ) are given for initial densities from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.05 .\nthere are many variations of single - species models of population dynamics that exhibit allee effects ( see table 1 of boukal and berec 2002 ) , however the growth function of eqn .\nthe behavior of this verhulst ( 1838 ) logistic model modified to include a nonlinear cubic term ( based on the fitzhugh - nagumo equations ; fitzhugh 1960 ; nagumo et al .\n1962 ) , is bistable , with equilibria at u = 0 ( extinction ) , u = a ( unstable threshold ) , and u = 1 ( carrying capacity ) .\nfigure 1a shows this behavior in terms of the growth of the population ( change in population density with respect to time ) versus the population density . at densities below the critical threshold ( a )\nthere is negative population growth declining to extinction ( from here on the population is considered extinct below a cutoff density of 0.0001 , as a declining population trajectory will only asymptotically approach zero in a deterministic model ; gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) ; otherwise the population will reach carrying capacity .\n1b with the graph of the solution of the growth function ( population size versus time ) at various initial densities . when diffusion is added to this model of population growth ,\nthere are two critical elements that emerge based on the solution to the partial differential equation ( pde ) .\nthe first is the wave speed , which is determined by the allee threshold ( a ) . as we are considering a strong allee effect in this model ( i.e. , 0 < a < 1 , where the population below this threshold exhibits negative growth versus reduced positive growth from a weak allee effect )\n, there exists a unique wave speed of the invasion front that is a result of being \npushed from the inside out , as opposed to being  pulled by the leading edge ( lewis and kareiva 1993 )\n. this velocity can be derived through the solution of the pde ( 1 ) :   ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ; murray 1993 ) .\nthis result suggests that in order for a wave to maintain a positive velocity of advance , the magnitude of the allee threshold ( a ) must be less than half of the maximum value of the population density relative to the carrying capacity .\nin addition to the velocity of the wave front , the region occupied by the invading population must exceed a certain critical size for positive growth to occur ( skellam 1951 ; kierstead and slobodkin 1953 ) .\nthis phenomenon is clearly explained by okubo ( 1980 ) by noting that whereas reproduction takes place within a region or patch , diffusion takes place at the boundaries resulting in a loss of organisms , thus reducing the density within the patch .\nthis tradeoff in the ratio of inner region volume to outer surface area will either allow a population to grow or decline with an inverse relationship of diffusivity to rate of growth .\nthis relationship gives a minimum region within which reproduction can not compensate for loss due to diffusion , especially when allee effects influence population growth .\nthus , lewis and kareiva ( 1993 ) derive a minimum size condition ( i.e. , the radius of the initial beachhead ) based on the wave speed that is required for the population to establish and radially expand .\nwe address this critical size threshold qualitatively , as the analytical solution ( i.e. , ; lewis and kareiva 1993 ) is for two - dimensional spread , while we work with a simpler one - dimensional model .\nthe minimum critical radius is proportional to the ratio of diffusivity ( i.e. , diffusion coefficient , d ) to the reproductive rate ( controlled by r ) .\nthe inclusion of diffusion in the model provides a spatially explicit understanding of how all of the components interact to affect invasion / establishment success .\nthe diffusion process has been extensively analyzed in invasion processes ( e.g. , fisher 1937 ; skellam 1951 ; okubo 1980 ) . in order to incorporate evolutionary factors that may influence invasion success ,\nthis genetic subsystem is coupled to the ecological model to explore the effects of selection and genetic variance on traits that may increase a population 's likelihood of survival .\nspecifically , we allow the allee threshold to become a dynamic parameter that is considered to be a fitness related trait ( e.g. , a trait impacting the component allee effect ) . from here on , except in the absence of evolution , referring to the allee threshold implies that that value is the initial value , as it changes over time .\nthis quantitative trait influences an organism 's ability to survive and reproduce in a small population .\nthe results reveal the possibility that an introduced population that would fail to persist in the ecological context of this model has the potential to succeed through evolutionary means . including evolution within the context of ecological invasions can serve to provide more robust predictions for management strategies .\ntherefore , it is important to investigate the possibility of evolution in the analysis of invasions .\nthe framework that is used to link evolutionary change with ecological processes involves developing a relationship between the fast , ecological and slow , evolutionary timescales in order to make these rates comparable ( kondrashov and khibnik 1996 ) . in the coupled evolutionary ecology model , the reaction - diffusion eqn .\n( 1 ) describes the change in the population density over time and is tied into a genetic subsystem that allows the organismal response to population density to evolve in terms of the selection gradient and genetic variance .\nas the population dynamics vary across space , the genetic subsystem describes the rate of change of the trait mean ( i.e. , the allee parameter ) at each location x by : ( pease et al .\n1989 ; garca - ramos and kirkpatrick 1997 ; kirkpatrick and barton 1997 ; hare et al .\nthe first term on the right hand side reflects the force of local directional selection , where the selection gradient for frequency - independent selection is the rate of change of the mean malthusian fitness function ( i.e. , per - capita growth rate : ) with respect to the trait , a ( lande 1976 ; falconer 1989 ) .\nthus , , where we assume that individual fitness approaches the population mean fitness , as most individuals are close to the average phenotype ( webb 2003 ) .\nthis suggests that the genetic variance (  ) is small ( and constant in this model ) .\nthis small parameter for the genetic variance can be used to couple the fast ecological timescale , t , with the slow evolutionary timescale ,  = t ( kondrashov and khibnik 1996 ; webb 2003 ) . combing these two components of genetic variance and selection ,\nquantifies the effect of natural selection on the local mean value of the quantitative trait ( the allee parameter ; lande 1976 ; falconer 1989 ) . in order to account for the influence of migration on the trait 's local mean , the latter two terms in eqn .\nthe middle term takes into account asymmetrical gene flow caused by the variation of density across space ( pease et al .\n1989 ; garca - ramos and kirkpatrick 1997 ; kirkpatrick and barton 1997 ; hare et al .\nthis captures the influence of the mean trait value ( i.e. , genetic contribution ) from more abundant populations to less abundant neighboring locations due to the spatial gradient , as more individuals migrate from areas with relatively high population densities .\nthe last term mirrors the diffusion term from the ecological model , and describes the homogenizing effect of random dispersal .\nwe solved the spatially explicit system numerically using matlab 7.0 ( 2004 , the mathworks , natick , ma , usa ) using a finite difference method to incorporate diffusion and gene flow ( adapted from garvie 2007 ) . by iterating eqns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) forward in time\n, the population density and allee threshold at each location

gradient and genetic variance . as the population dynamics vary across space , the genetic subsystem describes the rate of change of the trait mean ( i.e. , the allee parameter ) at each location x by

approximate / represent the critical conditions that govern this dynamical system .\nthe dynamics of the evolutionary ecology model can be interpreted using the idea of fast and slow timescales ( kondrashov and khibnik 1996 ; webb 2003 ) .\nearlier , we assumed that the genetic variation (  ) was small ( to use mean fitness as a proxy for individual fitness ) , which can subsequently be taken advantage of for our analysis of the coupled evolutionary ecological dynamics . when  = 0 , the situation without evolution , the genetic subsystem is frozen and the population moves towards a stable equilibrium of the ecological subsystem ( carrying capacity or extinction ) depending on its initial density ( greater than or less than the allee threshold respectively ; fig .\nwhen  > 0 but small , the allee threshold evolves relatively slowly and influences the ecological system . whenever the population is below its carrying capacity ( u = 1 for each spatial coordinate x when space is explicit ) , eqn .\n( 2 ) is negative , and decreases the mean allee threshold ( a ) , as the intensity of selection is density dependent .\nthus , fitness increases as allee effects are suppressed , and selection drives the allee threshold towards zero .\nif the population density is greater than the allee threshold , but still below the carrying capacity , it will progress towards carrying capacity more rapidly than it would without evolution as a decreases ; as the rate at which the population density changes ( eqn .\n1 ) is proportional to the difference between u and a. the ecological dynamics are reversed when the population density is below the allee threshold as the population declines towards extinction , but more slowly than it does without evolution . when u < a , eqn .\n( 1 ) is negative , and the population density approaches extinction more rapidly with a constant ( as the difference between u and a increases ) , than it does with evolution as a decreases ( revealing a more pronounced time lag to extinction ) . during this time lag ,\nas the population slowly declines , the opportunity for evolution to overcome inverse density dependent effects occurs .\nif the rate of evolution is fast enough , the allee threshold can fall below the population density , causing the rate of change of population density to become positive ( where u > a ) and the population grows and can successfully invade .\nthe chance that evolution can rescue the population from extinction depends on the relative rates of genetic change in the quantitative trait ( i.e. , allee threshold ) and of population decline ( gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) ; hence the amount of genetic variance greatly impacts the ability to adapt and survive .\na nonspatial example of this process , referred to as evolutionary rescue ( gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) , is shown in fig .\n2 , where a population is introduced below the allee threshold . without evolution , the population declines to extinction ( fig . 2a , solid line ) as the allee threshold remains constant ( fig . 2b , solid line ) . when the population can evolve ( fig .\n2 , dotted line ) , it declines at first until it can overcome the magnitude of inverse density dependence , and is then able to successfully establish . as it is difficult to measure the allee effect empirically ( tobin et al .\n2007 ) , we use an extreme value that exaggerates density dependent effects in order to investigate the  worst case scenario ( a = 0.3 , where the population exhibits deterministic decline when its density is less than 30% of its carrying capacity ) . when evolution is included , we used a small value for the genetic variance ,  = 0.02 , in order to remain consistent with fast - slow dynamics , unless otherwise indicated .\ncomparison of an invading population introduced at a density below the allee threshold , a = 0.3 ( u = 0.25 , r = 0.6 ) .\nthe solid line represents the nonspatial system ( d = 0 ) described by eqns ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) without evolution (  = 0 ) which results in extinction ( a ) and a constant allee threshold ( b ) .\nthe dotted line indicates population growth ( a ) when evolution (  = 0.02 ) acts to reduce the allee threshold ( b ) . in general , there is a range of parameter space that permits persistence for a population below the allee threshold in the nonspatial model with evolution ( instead of simple decline to extinction ) .\nas genetic variance increases , we are essentially relaxing the assumption of fast - slow timescales and allow evolution to occur more rapidly .\n3 where initial population densities below the allee threshold require a minimum amount of genetic variance in order to avoid extinction . in this case\n, the rate of reproduction , r , also influences the potential for evolutionary rescue , as it impacts both population growth and rate of evolution ( eqns 1 and 2 , respectively ) .\nas we relax the assumption of fast - slow timescales , the behavior remains qualitatively the same as that described analytically under a strict fast - slow timescale assumption .\nparameter combinations of reproductive rate : r ; genetic variance :  , and initial population density : u , that result in extinction or evolutionary rescue . in this nonspatial scenario ,\ninitial population densities greater than the allee threshold ( a = 0.3 ) always succeed , thus the focus is on the parameter space that allows for evolutionary rescue ( i.e. , where the population growth changes from negative to positive ) . as the reproductive rate increases from 0.1 to 1\n, there is less genetic variance needed for a population to evolve to overcome inverse density dependence as increased reproduction will contribute to suppressing allee effects .\nnonetheless , the additional complexities result in qualitatively similar behavior to the nonspatial model . in this case , not only will evolution influence population growth , it affects the wave speed and the critical size threshold , rmin .\nas the population overcomes allee effects with a decreasing allee threshold , the wave speed accelerates and the critical patch size becomes smaller .\nthus , in addition to the initial density of the introduced population and the genetic variance , the initial radius or patch size of the initial invasion area , the ratio of diffusion to reproduction , and gene flow will factor into successful establishment and give rise to a wider range of interactions between the ecology and evolution of this system .\n( 1 ) ( without the evolutionary subsystem ) in one - dimensional space , with an initial population density below the allee threshold , declines to extinction ( fig .\nthis is contrasted by the results when the evolutionary subsystem is included . with the initial population density below the allee threshold , fig .\nthe same type of rescue occurs for a population that starts near carrying capacity , but occupies an initial spatial size below that which is necessary for a population to successfully establish .\nfigure 5a shows a rapidly declining population that goes extinct . under the same circumstance , but where evolution of the allee threshold occurs , fig .\n5b shows the population density at first beginning to shrink and then growing and expanding .\nin addition to the time evolution of population density across space in figs 4 and 5 , the evolution of the mean trait value across space illustrates how gene flow and the density dependent selection gradient influences its rate of change and distribution ( figs 4c and 5c ) . as the intensity of selection is density dependent ( and we assume constant genetic variance ) , locations with smaller populations can evolve the trait value more rapidly compared to other areas where allee effects may not be as strong and experience weaker selection .\nthe trait distribution over time , figs 4c and 5c , therefore reflect the population density distribution , but are also influenced by the trait values of the migrants . as individuals disperse out to new locations and push the boundaries of the species range , their trait values are averaged to determine the demographic allee threshold for that spatial coordinate . this demographic allee threshold combines with their local population density to influence individual fitness and population growth ( where the distance between the density and mean trait value is the initial degree of maladaptation ) .\ndiffusive dispersal of an introduced population at an initial density ( bold dashed line ) below the

of an invader with evolution (  = 0.02 ) after initial decline .\n( c ) the evolution of the mean value of the allee threshold across space ( where the initial distribution is given by the bold dashed line ) .\nthe population density distribution and corresponding trait values ( i.e. , allee threshold ) are plotted at equal time increments ( every 20 of 1200 model iterations ) .\nwe explored when evolutionary rescue occurred across a range of parameter values for the spatially explicit model . according to drake et al .\n( 2005 ) , variability among locations and over time makes it unreasonable to determine precise estimates for the diffusion coefficient , d. we therefore explored a range of values , and present those that best illustrate breadth of behavior .\nthe parameter that controls the reproductive rate , r , was also varied substantially , but as the spatial dynamics depend on the ratio of diffusion to rate of reproduction ( resulting in a measure of length ) ; we fixed r and varied d , unless otherwise noted .\nthis was justified as the results of the spatial simulations are qualitatively identical for equivalent ratios .\nthe effects of the critical patch size , initial population density , ratio of diffusion to growth and genetic variation on evolutionary rescue and population dynamics are shown in fig .\nthe ratio of the diffusion coefficient ( d ) to the reproductive rate ( r ) determines whether the population will expand or collapse according to the initial radius of the introduced population .\nthe areas under the curves denote combinations of genetic variance and initial population density that result in extinction .\nareas above the curves are combinations of genetic and/or demographic conditions that produce inevitable persistence .\nthe parameter space between the vertical dashed lines refers to the different ways population survival is influenced . to the left of the initial allee threshold\n, the initial population density will either go extinct due to density dependent effects ( below the d / r curve ) , or given enough genetic variation , will be evolutionarily rescued ( above the d / r curve ) .\nthe area to the right of the initial allee threshold [ and between the dashed lines in ( b ) and ( c ) ] is the case where the initial population density is greater than the allee threshold but due to the initial spatial size and the ratio of diffusion to reproduction , the population may go extinct without sufficient genetic variance ( below the d / r curve ) , otherwise it will evolve to overcome the critical patch size effect . for initial population densities\nthus , the area between the dashed lines in ( b ) and ( c ) truly delineates evolutionary rescue when d / r = 1 .\nthe rightmost vertical line moves slightly to the left to the point of intersection of the d / r curve and the x - axis for other values of d / r .\ngraphs ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) represent different radii of the linear habitat that the introduced population initially occupies .\nwhen the size of the initial population is too small ( i.e. , a radius of 1 ) , a population at carrying capacity ( i.e. , u = 1 ) will go extinct without evolution due to the relative effect of diffusion to reproduction ( fig .\nif evolution occurs rapidly enough ( i.e. ,  > 0.02 ) , the population can overcome inverse density dependent effects and compensate for the loss due to diffusion and rebound from low densities . when the initial radius of the population is increased ( fig .\n6b , c ) , the chance of survival and establishment ( growth and expansion ) of populations above or below the allee threshold increases with initial density and genetic variance .\ntherefore , the initial radius of the population can significantly impact the likelihood of evolutionary rescue for populations with the same amount of genetic variance .\nthis is demonstrated further in fig . 7a , where the rate of recovery ( i.e. , the inverse of the time lag before growth becomes positive and the population reaches carrying capacity ) for a population near carrying capacity depends on its initial size / radius and genetic variance . where size and variance are small\n, rescue never occurs . as these parameters increase , the rate of recovery gradually becomes faster until it essentially plateaus ( although with greater variance and initial radius , the rate of recovery may slow slightly if the initial spatial extent is large enough for the population to experience early growth before diffusion causes decline prior to recovery ) .\nif the population occupies a large enough spatial extent , it will succeed without evolution ( where the genetic variance is zero ) , however the lag time may be more pronounced depending on the ratio of diffusion to reproduction through the tradeoff between growth and spread ( e.g. , if spread is relatively fast compared to reproduction , d / r = 1 ) . the population density may thus initially decline across space until reproduction can sufficiently overcome the loss due to diffusion , and the population can grow to carrying capacity .\nsimilar to the nonspatial case , a population ( greater than the allee threshold ) above the spatial threshold will grow to carrying capacity more rapidly with evolution than without .\nrate of recovery in terms of the inverse of the time lag before population growth becomes positive , where one  timestep equals 24 iterations of the model . in ( a )\n, the initial population density is near carrying capacity ( u = 0.95 , a = 0.3 , d / r = 1 ) , and the initial radius and genetic variance ,  , varies .\nwhere the rate of recovery is zero , the population goes extinct as it initially occupies an area smaller than the critical patch size ( in this case , a radius of 1.4 ) or does not have sufficient genetic variance to evolve quickly enough to be rescued prior to extinction . increasing the genetic variance and initial radius will decrease this time lag until the population no longer experiences any negative growth ( in this case , for initial radii  3.8 and   0.036 ; for initial radii > 2.7 , the rate of recovery slows slightly due to early growth followed by a transient decline that precedes ultimate recovery ) .\nwhen the initial population density varies ( indicating the initial degree of maladaptation where a = 0.3 ) , ( b ) shows the rate of recovery with the initial radius fixed ( as in fig .\n5a where the radius = 1 and d / r = 1 ) . in this case\n, extinction will occur without evolution not only for an initial density below the initial allee threshold , but for any density as the initial radius is below the critical patch size .\nhence , a nonzero rate implies evolutionary rescue and a zero rate means extinction . as shown in fig .\n7b , when evolutionary rescue is possible , the initial level of maladaptation ( a0u0 ) and the genetic variance (  ) also determine the rate at which evolutionary rescue proceeds .\nfigure 7b uses parameters ( i.e. , radius and ratio of d to r ) for a population that would decline and go extinct without evolution regardless of the initial density .\nhence , it is clear that the amount of time required for a population to begin growing depends on its initial level of maladaptation ( to both the critical density and spatial thresholds ) and/or genetic variance . as the rate at which this rescue occurs depends on the amount of genetic variance ( eqn .\n2 ) , it may take an extremely long time ( as  0 , the rate of recovery  0 ) for the allee threshold to fall below the population density . in this circumstance , as the population density becomes very close to zero , the rate of change of the allee threshold is greater than that of the population density ( as u  0 , u/t 0 and a/t  -2ra )\n. thus , theoretically , rescue would always occur ( gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) . however , to maintain biological realism , when solving this system numerically , we always considered the population extinct when the maximum density ( across space , when diffusion is included ) becomes reasonably close to zero ( i.e. , u = 0.0001 ; we chose this protocol instead of the total population across space due to the diffusion dynamics based on the gaussian dispersal kernel and the  pushed wave front behavior ) .\noverall , the numerical results qualitatively hold for a wide range of dimensional parameter values and initial conditions with and without diffusion and in one- and two - dimensional space .\nresults for two - dimensional space are not shown as they are qualitatively similar to the simpler , one dimensional model .\nfrom these results , it is apparent that adaptations that enable organisms to overcome the negative effects of low densities can allow the population to rebound from a trajectory toward extinction to grow to reach carrying capacity .\ncurrent management strategies ( e.g. , reducing population density or size ) are based on ecological theory ( e.g. drake et al . 2005 ) , but this evolutionary ecology model suggests that adaptive evolution can enable successful establishment and that ecological considerations alone may not be sufficient . under the assumptions of an allee effect and diffusive dispersal , the idea of ecological size thresholds fits well with the ecological evidence that a large founding population is a primary cause of successful establishment ( lockwood et al .\nhowever , by incorporating evolution , we see that the situation is not quite this simple because ecological size thresholds and genetic variance can interact to determine successful establishment . as\nthe ratio of diffusion to reproduction decreases , the spatial constraint on population growth becomes weaker , and less genetic variance is needed to rescue populations with densities below the allee threshold . as the initial spatial radius of introduction increases ,\nfurthermore , the rate of this rescue depends on the initial genetic load or maladaptation ( i.e. , how far the population density is from the allee threshold ) , as well as the amount of genetic variance .\nbecause bottlenecks during founding events do not always result in highly reduced genetic variability , even small founding populations may have sufficient genetic variation to evolve to overcome allee effects and establish , contrary to solely ecologically based predictions .\nadditionally , we can draw several general insights about how dispersal impacts selection and evolution of allee effects in an invasion context .\nas species are transported from their native environment into novel habitats or simply disperse on their own , it is clear that the genetic composition of the local population can influence the rate of evolution and adaptation to the new local conditions . given enough genetic diversity , local populations can adapt to their local environment , but dispersal may hinder survival across ecological clines as dispersers tend to be maladapted to the new local environment . essentially , local population persistence depends on the race between the rate of evolution and the degree of maladaptation ( gomulkiewicz and holt 1995 ) . in this case\n, gene flow will play a major role in determining the outcome . as kirkpatrick and barton ( 1997 ) and garca - ramos and kirkpatrick ( 1997 )\ndemonstrate , individuals moving from one selection regime from the center of their species range to the periphery can introduce enough maladaptation that the new area becomes a sink environment . on the other hand , holt et al .\n( 2003 , 2004 ) show that immigration can have a positive influence on adaptation to sink environments , in some circumstances .\nresolving the disparity between these perspectives requires understanding what is contributing to the severity of maladaptation and the population 's ability to overcome it . in our model ,\ndispersal impacts survival ecologically through the critical patch size , and genetically , as individuals may move from areas where they are well adapted ( i.e. , the population density is greater than the allee threshold or mean trait value ) to sink regions , where they are maladapted .\nas individuals disperse across space , they may be contributing positively in an ecological sense to the quality of their new local environment ( by increasing the local population density ) .\nhowever , dispersers are more likely to come from higher density areas where allee effects , and hence selection , are locally weak .\nthese dispersers potentially introduce more maladaptation to their new location , because they increase the average phenotype ( allee threshold ) in the new location where density is likely to be lower .\ninterestingly , the evolutionary impacts of migration in this model do not dramatically influence the dynamics .\nchanges to the local mean phenotype through local selection and simple mixing ( i.e. , diffusion ) actually slightly hastens the evolutionary rescue effect over a model that considers only the impact of local selection .\nas the selection intensity is density dependent and proportional to u 1 for each point in space , the peripheral individuals faced with stronger selection with lower trait values have a small positive influence on the more dense neighboring populations .\nthe gradient term accounts for asymmetric gene flow due to differential migration from areas of relatively high population densities .\nhowever , this term does not alter the overall evolutionary dynamics based on local selection any more than adding the diffusion term , as the negative effects of gene flow and the local rate of evolution ( which is relatively fast , based on the selection intensity ) essentially cancel each other out . in this context ,\nsimilar to that of holt et al . ( 2003 , 2004 ) , the immigrants simply contribute to the local population density , which helps prevent extinction long enough for evolutionary rescue to occur locally ( i.e. , positive population growth ; note that whereas holt et al .\n( 2003 ) attribute the main effect of immigration to the contribution of variation , this is not the case in our model , as we assume constant genetic variance ) .\n( 2004 ) where immigration has a demographic effect on increasing fitness that can essentially outweigh the \nthe primary determinant of invasion success depends on positive population growth at the center of the introduced range .\nthis result comes from the allee effect [ and the solution to the pde ( 1 ) ] by forcing a  pushed travelling wave front ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ) , where the wave speed causes population expansion , contraction , or propagation failure ( i.e. , pinning ; keitt et al\n. 2001 ) . intuitively , aggregation - like behavior emerges based on the strength of the allee effects .\nindividuals that disperse too far from the whole are likely to die before they can  pull others in their vicinity . in this\nregard , growth occurs from the inside out , where the population seemingly spills out and overflows to expand its range .\nconsequently , in this study , and for biological invasions that exhibit similar dynamics , it is more important to focus on the center of the invader 's range and whether the initial beachhead can survive ( through evolutionary rescue ) , than the fate of peripheral populations at the wave front when determining the importance of evolution on invasion success .\nthe overall dynamics are qualitatively similar in the parameter space that allows for evolutionary rescue to occur .\neven though gene flow and spatial structure do not dramatically influence the establishment of an introduced population , additional invasion criteria need to be considered .\nwhen analyzing the model behavior in a spatially explicit context , there is an ecological tradeoff between growth and spread that affects establishment and the rate of recovery . as previously mentioned , reproduction needs to compensate for the loss due to diffusion . including evolution and suppressing allee effects\n, actually contributes to the acceleration of the wave front ( i.e. , enhancing dispersal speed ) . a population then can more rapidly disperse as it evolves , and may become more of an invasion threat as long as this range expansion does not reduce their density too quickly . whereas this increasing wave speed can lead to a slightly longer lag phase prior to positive population growth , the population will likely be inevitably rescued because this effect primarily influences the dynamics at the periphery and is offset by the reduction in the critical invasion area ( rmin ) .\nalthough there is no range contraction ( as there is always a positive wave velocity with unbounded expansion due to the parameter values and absence of environmental heterogeneity or range limitations ; filin et al .\n2008 ) , as the critical patch size ( rmin ) becomes smaller with the decreasing allee threshold , rescue occurs more readily at the range center as the critical patch size threshold criteria weakens and the behavior approaches that of the nonspatial model .\nthis may seem like an oversimplification of the global dynamics ; however these conclusions are valid in the context of this investigation which focuses on the establishment phase rather than subsequent range expansion and spread . recognizing that evolution can significantly affect the establishment success of invasive species is becoming more widely accepted , influencing the ways in which invasion biologists conduct their research ( see the other articles in this issue ) .\nspecifically , adaptations that diminish allee effects and evolutionary responses to density dependence are beginning to emerge as viable explanations for sustaining vulnerable populations at low density and size ( gascoigne et al .\nas it is difficult to conclusively support this claim empirically ( as the origin of the adaptation or the associated cost may be unknown ; courchamp et al . 2008 ; gascoigne et al .\n2009 ) , mathematical models that incorporate evolution and compare the effects of various strategies ( e.g. , mitigating component allee effects ) can help decipher the mechanisms that both limit and facilitate population growth .\ntwo such models that incorporate adaptations to component mate - finding allee effects compare the efficiency and survival of populations at various densities that attract mates with or without a sexual pheromone ( jonsson et al .\nanother study suggests that broadcast spawners that evolve their gamete morphology and performance under sperm limitation ( at low density ) bear a cost of decreased fitness at high density due to hybridization and competition ( levitan 2002 ) .\nin these cases , particular strategies are shown to influence population viability in addition to an associated tradeoff , whereas our investigation provides broad , albeit simplistic , results dealing with generalized demographic allee effects and evolution . in order to understand how the results of this simplistic model extend to more realistic and complex evolutionary scenarios , spatially explicit\n, individually - based stochastic simulation of the introduced populations should be developed to investigate more closely the mechanisms that allow these population level dynamics to emerge .\nin particular , tracking the mean value of a component allee effect is sufficient to illustrate how evolution can overcome inverse density dependence and result in invasion .\nhowever , this approach may not be sufficient to make the specific quantitative predictions necessary for management of invasive species .\nthis is due to the simplifying assumption of constant genetic variance based on mutation - selection balance ( lande 1976 ) .\ncomplex simulations could relax this assumption and permit genetic variation to change via mutation , selection , and drift , in tandem with the demographic processes in a heterogeneous environment , and explicitly investigate the costs associated with avoiding allee effects .\nhence , future models should incorporate how propagule pressure ( size and frequency of introduction events ) impacts genetic variation and how more realistic genetic architectures contribute to the evolutionary trajectory of invasive species .\nalthough there is still much more work to be done to elucidate the factors that determine establishment success of founder populations , this theoretical approach has the promise to provide evidence in support of our working hypothesis that adaptive evolution can mitigate allee effects and be an important driver of biological invasions ."}
{"id": 107, "text": "genital infection due to chlamydia trachomatis is one of the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) . according to the who estimates , globally 92 million new cases of c. trachomatis infection\noccur each year and about two - thirds of these cases occur in the developing world , where diagnostic and treatment services are scarce [ 2 , 3 ] .\nmost epidemiological data on chlamydia trachomatis infection ( cti ) is from industrialized nations and reliable data from the resource poor developing nations is not available where the disease burden is concentrated .\nhowever , it is important to document laboratory - confirmed incidence and prevalence of cti from the developing world as well .\nthe available indian data show a wide variation in ct prevalence with infection rates in indian women ranging from 3.3% to 33% depending on the population sampled [ 413 ] .\ninfection with this agent is usually asymptomatic in up to 80% of women which makes diagnosis and detection all the more difficult . left undetected and untreated the infection may evolve into pelvic inflammatory disease and may result in serious sequelae , such as ectopic pregnancy and infertility [ 14 , 15 ] .\ncti in women has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes like recurrent miscarriage and preterm labor and may cause conjunctivitis , nasopharyngitis , and pneumonia in newborns by vertical transmission . because the infection is easily treatable with antibiotics , early detection and treatment of infected individuals\nare the key to prevent adverse sequelae among those infected and reduce c. trachomatis transmission .\nthus , it is important to screen adolescents and sexually active women for cti even if they are asymptomatic [ 17 , 18 ] . but , in the developing countries with the exception of sporadic testing , screening for chlamydia is rarely done .\nepidemiological studies have also shown that untreated genital chlamydia infection can lead to an increased risk for heterosexual acquisition of hiv . hence , screening for cti done in high risk populations can assist in designing hiv risk reduction strategies .\non the other hand , immunosuppression due to hiv may lead to more aggressive chlamydia disease conditions like pid in hiv seropositive women .\nthus , screening for cti in hiv seropositive women is highly recommended to prevent morbidity associated with the disease and devastating clinical consequences .\ndifferent diagnostic modalities for detection of cti like serology , culture method , elisa for antigen and antibody , direct fluorescence assay ( dfa ) and nucleic acid amplification tests ( naats ) have been used in the last 20 years but none of them are 100% sensitive .\ntable 1 shows the prevalence of cti detected by using different diagnostic techniques in new delhi population .\npolymerase chain reaction is an accurate , rapid , and reliable method for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis .\nreal -

sectional analysis to determine the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis infection by using real - time pcr in hiv seropositive and seronegative , symptomatic , and asymptomatic women visiting the ictc of our department .\nsubjects were enrolled in this study following institutional ethical committee clearance and a written informed consent of all participants . each participant was interviewed using a questionnaire concerning general sociodemographic information , personal details , and clinical symptoms .\nsubjects having one or more of the following symptoms were considered symptomatic for rti : vaginal discharge , vesicular and/or nonvesicular genital ulcers , inguinal bubo , lower abdominal pain , genital skin conditions , urinary burning or frequency , dysmenorrhea , menorrhagia , and intermenstrual bleeding .\nvesicular and/or nonvesicular genital ulcers , lower abdominal pain , genital skin conditions , urinary burning or frequency , dysmenorrhea , menorrhagia , and intermenstrual bleeding .\neach study subject then underwent a general physical , per abdomen , per speculum , and per vaginum examination .\ndiagnosis of hiv infection was done by following the standard protocol at our ictc that employs pretest and posttest counseling and obtains informed consent before hiv testing .\nthree different rapid tests were used to detect hiv-1 and hiv-2 antibodies ( combaids ( span diagnostics ltd . ) , retrocheck hiv ( qualpro diagnostics ) , and tri -

confirmed data on the incidence / prevalence of rtis / stis in india . as the asymptomatic nature of stis  \nis well known , there is a need to adopt a specific strategy for the screening of the sexually active population in india to reduce the overall rate of stis , which would , in turn , reduce the risk of hiv infection .\nour study presents an insight into the prevalence data of genital chlamydia infections in hiv - infected and hiv - uninfected women visiting the ictc of new delhi 's largest tertiary care hospital .\nthe mean age of the hiv seropositive subjects in our study was 30.92  5.7 and that of the hiv seronegative control group was 28.52  6.9 .\nthis compares well with the findings of another study done in baroda , india , to look for the prevalence of rtis in hiv - infected women wherein the mean age for hiv positive women was 30 and that for hiv negative women was 27 .\nthe predominant age group in the hiv positive participants in our study was 2635 years .\nthis association of chlamydia infection with younger age is consistent with studies from other developing countries [ 32 , 33 ] .\nthis finding supports the fact that young sexually active adults should constitute a priority target group in the sti control program .\nhowever , the findings of our study can not be generalized to all sexually active adults as the study has its limitations of a small sample size and the study participants belonging to a high risk group being recruited from the ictc of our department .\n80% of our hiv positive study participants were married which is quiet similar to what has been reported by another study from sub - saharan africa in which 85.3% of the hiv - infected women were married .\nthis finding highlights the importance of concurrently screening and treating spouses / sexual partners to decrease the sti burden in the country but this is challenging due to the lack of knowledge and cooperation from husbands especially in the indian setup . in the present study , vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain\nwere the 2 most frequently reported symptoms by the symptomatic women in both the study and the control groups , confirming the data reported by some previous indian studies [ 22 , 29 ] .\nanother notable observation of our study was that vaginitis was the most common clinical finding detected on per speculum examination in both the hiv positive ( 50% ) and the hiv negative groups ( 56.67% ) which is in accordance with the observations of garg et al . and\nbalamurugan and bendigeri where a majority of women on clinical examination had vaginitis of 94.6% and 36.9%% , respectively [ 22 , 35 ] .\nthe present study also validates the fact that chlamydia infections are usually asymptomatic as 10% of the asymptomatic women were diagnosed with cti while only 3.3% of symptomatic women had lab - confirmed cti in the hiv positive study group .\nonce again this emphasizes the importance of routine screening of at risk young sexually active women . in our study\ncti was detected in 6.67% ( 4/60 ) hiv - infected women and in 1.67% ( 1/60 ) hiv - uninfected women by real - time pcr although this difference was not statistically significant but the odds ratio was 4.214 . a study from cuba reported c. trachomatis infection in 10% of hiv - infected cases and 6.6% of hiv - uninfected cases by nested pcr but\nthe difference was not statistically significant while the odds ratio was 3.39 which is in concordance with our study .\nstudies conducted by natividad - villanueva et al . in usa and seck et al . in senegal reported c. trachomatis infection in 3.33% and 2.1% of hiv - infected females , respectively [ 38 , 39 ] .\nlarger studies are required to validate our observation as our study was restricted to a small number of cases .\nthis study clearly shows that cti is more prevalent among hiv - infected females ( with or without symptoms of rti ) as compared to hiv - uninfected females .\nour study also stresses the usefulness of screening asymptomatic hiv - infected and hiv - uninfected females for cti by risk assessment and diagnostic testing periodically to prevent the occurrence of adverse outcomes associated with the disease and also to check further spread of infection in the community . for countries like india that still do not currently have an active chlamydia screening program in place ,\nrandomized controlled trials are required to delineate the benefits of screening in the sexually active population as our study participants represent a high risk group .\nit is also important that any test adopted in a national screening program be used in the primary care setting by practitioners without the need for expensive training and equipment .\nhowever , since use of real - time pcr is not feasible in most hospitals in developing countries efforts should be made to develop a simple , cost - effective , sensitive , and specific point of care test to identify and treat women with cti for prevention of sequelae and hiv transmission ."}
{"id": 108, "text": "multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( mcsm ) is a serious disease which can lead to spinal cord dysfunction and a substantial decrease in quality of life . in addition , mcsm requiring multilevel cervical spine surgery can be accompanied by extensive blood loss . as spinal surgery has become increasingly complex , so control of perioperative bleeding has become an important clinical issue for spine surgeons .\nexcessive blood loss can lead to a range of comorbidities such as anemia , hypotension , hematoma formation , and inadequate oxygenation of organs , thereby affecting patient outcome .\nexcessive blood loss often requires allogeneic blood transfusion , the risks of which are numerous and among which immunological reactions and transmission of viruses are considered the most serious . in addition , hematoma formation within a few millimeters of the spinal canal can cause considerable neurological damage .\nalthough occurrences of postoperative spinal hematoma formation requiring emergency surgery are rare , it is nevertheless important to control perioperative bleeding to decrease its incidence . tranexamic acid ( txa ) is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine which operates through competitive inhibition of the activation of plasminogen to plasmin by binding specific sites on both plasminogen and plasmin , thereby retarding fibrinolysis , the degradation of blood clots .\nit has been widely used in various medical fields such as cardiac surgery , gynecology , dentistry , urological surgery , and liver transplantation to reduce the perioperative blood loss , as it is relatively inexpensive and has not been cited in the literature as causing any significant untoward side effects . in addition , txa has been reported to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements during orthopedic surgery , most commonly in knee and hip joint replacement . although the benefits of txa in spinal surgery have been reported\nindeed , there are no studies of txa in cervical laminectomy with lateral mass screw fixation and bone grafting ( clf ) so far .\nclf has been widely used for many years for treating mcsm caused by multilevel cervical spinal cord compression .\nalthough some authors suggest that laminoplasty is superior to laminectomy with lateral mass screw fixation and bone grafting regarding preserved range of motion , indications for the use of clf are broader than that of laminoplasty and recent studies showed good outcomes for clf . thus , the aim of this study is to evaluate the

control group . although the hgb levels and hct in the txa group were higher than that of the control group , the differences were not significant , possibly because the sample size was too small and the perioperative blood loss in clf relatively minor .\na theoretical anxiety associated with the use of txa is its potential for inducing thromboembolic complications .\nhowever , many studies have

{"id": 111, "text": "inspection of the database of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins ( cogs )   revealed only one family of such proteins that is represented in most of the sequenced bacterial , archaeal and eukaryotic genomes .\nthe prototype of this family is the rhomboid ( rho ) protein from drosophila melanogaster , a developmental regulator involved in epidermal growth factor ( egf)-dependent signaling pathways [ 2 - 4 ] .\nnot only were homologs of rhomboid detected in prokaryotes and eukaryotes , but the pattern of sequence conservation in this family appeared uncharacteristic of nonenzymatic membrane proteins , such as transporters .\nspecifically , several polar amino - acid residues are conserved in nearly all members of the rhomboid family , suggesting the possibility of an enzymatic activity . as three of these conserved residues were histidines , it has been hypothesized that rhomboid - family proteins could function as metal - dependent membrane proteases .\nrecently , however , it has been shown that rho cleaves a transmembrane helix ( tmh ) in the membrane - bound precursor of the tgf-like growth factor spitz , enabling the released spitz to activate the egf receptor , and that a conserved serine and a conserved histidine in rho are essential for this cleavage .\nthus , it appears that rhomboid - family proteins are a distinct group of intramembrane serine proteases .\naltogether , the genome of drosophila encodes seven rho paralogs ( now designated rho1 - 7 , with the original rhomboid becoming rho-1 ) , at least three of which are involved in distinct egf - dependent pathways , apparently through proteolytic activation of diverse ligands of the egf receptor .\nthe newly discovered intramembrane proteolytic activity of rho places the rhomboid family within the framework of regulated intramembrane proteolysis ( rip ) , a new paradigm of signal transduction , which appears to be prominent in all forms of life . under rip , signaling proteins undergo site - specific proteolysis within tmh , resulting in the release of active fragments , which are the actual effectors in signal tranduction cascades . until recently\n, the only characterized cases of rip in eukaryotes involved presenilin-1 , an aspartyl protease , which cleaves a transmembrane helix in type-1 membrane proteins such as amyloid -precursor protein ( app ) , notch and ire1 , and the metalloprotease s2p , which cleaves a tmh in a type-2 transmembrane protein , the sterol - dependent transcription factor srebp .\nnotably , s2p has highly conserved bacterial homologs , and the protease domain of presenilins also might be homologous to bacterial and archaeal type iv prepilin peptidases , although , in this case , the sequence similarity is low . in the case of the rhomboid family ,\nthe existence of homologs of rho in most prokaryotes is particularly remarkable because animal rho proteins are involved in signaling pathways that are not found outside metazoa , which seems to make functional conservation in prokaryotes a remote possibility .\nthe only prokaryotic protein of the rhomboid family that has been characterized experimentally in considerable detail is aara from the bacterium providencia stuartii .\nthis protein is involved in the export of a quorum - sensing peptide , a function that , in physiological terms , resembles that of rho , although the signaling molecules , other than rho and aara , are obviously unrelated . in a striking recent development\n, two independent research groups have shown that several bacterial rhomboid - family proteins , including aara , can cleave the egf receptor ligands ( spitz , keren and gurken ) that are normally cleaved by rho paralogs .\nthe cleavage depended on the conserved serine and histidine residues   and , moreover , transgenic flies that expressed aara developed a phenotype indistinguishable from that induced by overexpression of rho , whereas rho could substitute for aara in providencia stuartii .\nthese unexpected findings demonstrated the conservation of a rip mechanism producing extracellular signals in eukaryotes and prokaryotes .\neukaryotic rhomboid family proteins seem to show considerable functional variability ; in particular , cross - talk might exist between different rip pathways . a distinct representative of the rhomboid family has been shown to physically interact with presinilins 1 and 2 , and was accordingly named presenilins - associated rhomboid - like protein ( parl ) .\nthe yeast ortholog of parl has been suggested to participate in the processing of cytochrome c peroxidase precursor during its import into the mitochondrion .\nthe near ubiquity of the rhomboid family among bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes , along with the remarkable functional conservation , suggests that a signaling mechanism mediated by rhomboids might have functioned already in the last common ancestor of all extant life forms , with subsequent loss in several lineages . to address this possibility\nalthough the sequence similarity between eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhomboid family proteins is relatively low ( around 10 - 15% identity in the conserved region ) , the entire superfamily could be retrieved from the protein sequence databases within three iterations of the psi - blast program with a high statistical significance and without any false positives .\nthe conserved core of the rhomboid family consists of six conserved tmhs ( figure 1 ) .\nthe predicted catalytic serine is located in tmh5 , whereas the predicted catalytic histidine is in tmh7 ; tmh3 contains two additional histidines and an asparagine , which are conserved in the great majority of the rhomboid - family proteins ( figure 1 ) .\nthe roles of these conserved residues are not known , but , given the remarkable evolutionary conservation , it seems likely that they also contribute to catalysis ; indeed , it has been shown that the conserved asparagine is required for the cleavage of spitz by rho .\nwhen examining the multiple alignment of the rhomboid superfamily proteins , we noticed that several eukaryotic members appear to be inactivated proteases , as indicated by the loss of the predicted catalytic serine or histidine ( figure 1 , and data not shown ) ; these inactivated forms could be regulators of active rhomboid proteases .\nseveral other proteins lack one or more of the conserved residues in tmh3 ; it remains unclear whether or not these are active proteases . bacterial and archaeal members of the rhomboid superfamily contain six tmh , whereas the eukaryotic members typically have an additional seventh tmh , which may be attached to the core either from the amino terminus or from the carboxyl terminus as discussed below .\nthe phyletic distribution pattern of the rhomboid family shows that this intramembrane protease is extremely common in all three kingdoms of life , but is not necessarily essential for cell function .\nrhomboids are missing in the microsporidian encephalitozoon cuniculi , a eukaryotic intracellular parasite with a highly degraded genome , the archaea methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus and thermoplasma volcanium , and several bacterial species , primarily parasites with small genomes but also species with moderately sized genomes , such as xylella fastidiosum ( see cog0705 at ) . in two instances ,\na representative of the rhomboid family is present in only one of a pair of relatively close genomes ( present in t. acidophilum but missing in t. volcanium ; present in the spirochete treponema pallidum but missing in the related bacterium borrelia burgdorferi ) , which suggests relatively recent , repeated losses of this gene .\nmost of the prokaryotic species have a single gene coding for a rhomboid - family protein , although some have two or three paralogs ( see cog0705 ) ; in contrast , eukaryotes show expansion of the rhomboid family , with seven members in drosophila , and as many as 13 in arabidopsis .\nthe multiple alignment of the 6-tmh core of the rhomboid family ( figure 1 ) was employed to construct a phylogenetic tree using the least - squares algorithm with subsequent optimization using the maximum likelihood ( ml ) method ( see materials and methods ) . only the conserved regions including the tmh and\nshort adjacent stretches shown in figure 1 were used as the input for tree building , whereas the poorly conserved intervening regions were omitted to avoid noise from potentially misaligned residues ( except for the bayesian analysis , which used the complete alignment ; see materials and methods ) .\nthe phylogenetic tree of the rhomboid family presents a complex and unexpected picture ( figure 2 ) .\nneither the eukaryotic nor the archaeal subsets of the family appear to form monophyletic clades .\ninstead , the eukaryotic rhomboids are split between two major subfamilies , which are positioned in the midst of different prokaryotic branches ( figure 2 ) .\nthe first subfamily , which includes six of the seven drosophila rhomboids , clusters with a distinct prokaryotic assemblage , consisting primarily of gram - positive bacteria as well as a subset of archaea ; this clade is strongly supported by bootstrap analysis ( figure 2 ) .\nthe proteins in this group of eukaryotic rhomboids , which we designated the rho subfamily , typically have an extra tmh added carboxy - terminally to the 6-tmh core ; some of these proteins also contain ef - hand calcium - binding domains amino - terminally of the core ( figure 2 ) .\nthe second eukaryotic subfamily , which we designated the parl subfamily , after parl , the human ortholog of drosophila rho7 , resides within a large , heterogeneous prokaryotic cluster ( figure 2 ) . within this subfamily , parl and its orthologs from other animals and from fungi\nhave distinct domain architecture , with an extra tmh added to the amino terminus of the core , whereas the rest have only the core ( a carboxy - terminal tmh and a ubiquitin - associated domain are appended in one arabidopsis protein ; figure 2 ) .\nthus , the existence of two distinct subfamilies of eukaryotic rhomboids is supported by features of domain architectures that appear to comprise shared derived characters . within these two major eukaryotic subfamilies ,\nseveral lineage - specific expansions of paralogs   are noticeable , in insects , mammals and plants ( figure 2 ) .\narchaeal rhomboids are scattered over the phylogenetic tree , with two major clusters and , in addition , three isolated proteins joining different bacterial branches ( figure 2 ) .\nthere is no indication of an affinity between any of the archaeal and eukaryotic rhomboids .\nalthough many of the bacterial rhomboids form phylogenetically coherent clusters corresponding to the established bacterial lineages , there are also several clusters that have an odd composition , such as the grouping of proteobacterial and gram - positive species ; some of these clusters are well supported by bootstrap ( see clusters 1 - 4 in figure 2 ) .\nthis concern is particularly serious for highly divergent families of membrane proteins , such as the rhomboids , in which parallel amino - acid substitutions are likely .\ntherefore we investigated the phylogeny of the rhomboid family in greater detail using several independent phylogenetic methods and the corresponding statistical tests .\nfirst , we assessed the robustness of the topology of the tree shown in figure 2 using the kishino - hasegawa ( kh ) test whereby the clade of interest is forced into various positions on the tree and the likelihoods of the resulting topologies are estimated .\nspecifically , the kh test was used to evaluate two alternative topologies , in which the rho and parl subfamilies formed a clade , and two topologies , in which the rho subfamily formed a clade with archaeal rhomboids ( figure 2 and table 1 ) .\neach of these alternative topologies had a significantly lower likelihood than the original topology shown in figure 2 ( see table 1 ) .\nin addition , a tree of the rhomboid family was constructed using the bayesian inference method , which has recently become a practical alternative to the more traditional methods of phylogenetic analysis .\nthe tree produced using the mrbayes package   showed the same major clades as the tree in figure 2 ( data not shown ) ; moreover , clustering of the rho and parl subfamilies of eukaryotic rhomboids with the respective prokaryotic clades was supported by high posterior probabilities ( figure 2 ) .\nwe also attempted to construct a phylogenetic tree of the rhomboid family by using the maximum parsimony method .\nthe resulting tree contained the same major clades as the trees constructed using ml and mrbayes ; however , the number of parsimony - informative sites was insufficient to obtain high bootstrap support with this approach ( data not shown ) .\nthe alternative phylogenies reflected two distinct hypotheses : first , clustering of the rho and parl subfamilies of eukaryotic rhomboids with the prokaryotic rhomboid families as suggested by the tree topology in figure 2 ; and second , monophyly of the eukaryotic rhomboids ( figure 3 ) .\nthe phylogenies corresponding to these alternative hypotheses were compared to the best phylogeny using three statistical tests ( table 2 ) .\nthe hypothesis 1 tree was not significantly different from the best tree under any of these tests whereas the hypothesis 2 tree was significantly ( p < 0.05 ) worse than the best tree according to each of the tests ( table 2 ) .\nthe concordance of the results obtained with several independent methods for phylogenetic tree construction and statistical analysis specifically aimed at testing the alternative hypothesis of monophyletic origin of eukaryotic rhomboids shows strong support for the major aspects of the tree topology in figure 2 and , in particular , for the polyphyly of eukaryotic rhomboids .\nthe phylogenetic tree of the rhomboid family shown in figure 2 and supported by the additional tests described above follows neither the ' standard model ' scenario , with the major split between the archaeo - eukaryotic and bacterial lineages nor the ' mitochondrial ' scenario , which postulates acquisition of a gene by eukaryotes from the pro - mitochondrial endosymbiont .\nneither can this tree be explained by postulating a small number of lineage - specific gene losses .\nthe parsimonious interpretation of the rhomboid family tree seems to be that the evolutionary history of this family had been replete with horizontal gene transfer ( hgt ) and lineage - specific gene loss events . in particular , in spite of the presence of rhomboids in the majority of modern life forms from all three primary superkingdoms , phylogenetic analysis suggests that this family has not been inherited from the last universal common ancestor ( luca ) .\ninstead , the tree topology seems to indicate that this family emerged in some bacterial lineage and afterwards had been widely disseminated by hgt , and then lost in some lineages .\nin particular , at least two hgt events seem to have contributed to the origin of eukaryotic rhomboids , one of them yielding the rho subfamily and the other one the parl subfamily , with a possible additional hgt in plants ( figures 2,3 ) . given the broad phyletic representation of both subfamilies of eukaryotic rhomboids , both the rho subfamily and the parl subfamily\nmust have been acquired through hgt at an early stage of eukaryotic evolution , definitely before the divergence of the major crown - group lineages .\nthis early epoch in eukaryotic evolution is thought to have been dominated by hgt from multiple bacterial symbionts .\nan alternative to this multiple - hgt scenario is that luca already had multiple , paralogous rhomboids , which evolved by a series of ancient gene duplications , and the odd topology of the phylogenetic tree is due primarily to differential loss of these ancient paralogs .\nalthough this can not be ruled out formally , this hypothesis implies the existence of an elaborate signaling system in luca and , accordingly , suggests that luca was a complex organism , which might have had as many genes as modern bacteria .\ntheoretical analysis of evolutionary scenarios constructed on the basis of the phyletic patterns of cogs by applying\nthe parsimony principle shows that the complexity of the inferred gene set of luca critically depends on the relative rates of gene loss and hgt at the early stages of evolution .\na complex luca with around 2,000 genes is predicted only when one assumes that the rate of gene loss is an order of magnitude greater than the rate of hgt .\nhowever , explicit reconstruction of the gene set of luca under the assumption of equal rates of gene loss and hgt leads to a hypothetical genome that consists of only around 600 genes but appears to be ' compatible with life ' , that is , it includes genes responsible for most , if not all , essential cellular functions .\nwe currently believe that this is the most realistic , albeit inevitably imprecise , reconstruction of luca 's gene set . with respect to the rhomboid family and other families\nwhose phylogenetic trees show similar patterns , this makes the multiple - hgt interpretation the scenario of choice . further theoretical\n, comparative - genomic and experimental analyses aimed at determining relative rates of gene loss and hgt will help in a more objective assessment of the validity of this argument .\nthe multiple - hgt interpretation of the evolutionary history of the rhomboid family , while supported by the above argument , seems , at least at first glance , distinctly counter - intuitive , given that this family is nearly ubiquitous among extant life forms .\nindeed , when attempts are made to construct parsimonious evolutionary scenarios on the basis of phyletic patterns alone [ 31 - 33 ] , there is no chance that such a widespread family is not assigned to luca .\nit should be realized , however , that these approaches are inherently probabilistic , and extensive hgt can fool them . for the rhomboid family , the multiple - hgt mode of evolution seems to be particularly plausible .\nit seems likely that the ultimate ancestor of the rhomboid family evolved from a nonenzymatic integral membrane protein , probably a transporter that might have been involved in an early primitive form of export of signaling peptides in bacteria .\nthe protease active center might have evolved in such a transporter by chance emergence of the suitable catalytic amino acids within two or three of the tmhs ( figure 4 ) .\nthis would enable the transition from simple transport to the rip mode of controlled export of signaling molecules .\nemergence of rip could have conferred a major selective advantage on the respective bacteria and might have resulted in an evolutionary sweep whereby the gene carrying this trait was repeatedly fixed , rather than eliminated , after hgt . in terms of the evolution of sequence itself ,\nthe requirements for the conservation of the protease activity apparently ' locked ' the rhomboid family in a regime of relatively slow evolution , which ensures significant sequence similarity between all family members ( figure 1 ) .\nthe scenario of origin from non - catalytic transporters might potentially apply to other integral membrane enzymes , including intramembrane proteases involved in rip , such as presenilins and their homologs   and the archaeo - eukaryotic signal peptide peptidase .\nalthough the sequence similarity between eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhomboid family proteins is relatively low ( around 10 - 15% identity in the conserved region ) , the entire superfamily could be retrieved from the protein sequence databases within three iterations of the psi - blast program with a high statistical significance and without any false positives .\nthe conserved core of the rhomboid family consists of six conserved tmhs ( figure 1 ) .\nthe predicted catalytic serine is located in tmh5 , whereas the predicted catalytic histidine is in tmh7 ; tmh3 contains two additional histidines and an asparagine , which are conserved in the great majority of the rhomboid - family proteins ( figure 1 ) .\nthe roles of these conserved residues are not known , but , given the remarkable evolutionary conservation , it seems likely that they also contribute to catalysis ; indeed , it has been shown that the conserved asparagine is required for the cleavage of spitz by rho .\nwhen examining the multiple alignment of the rhomboid superfamily proteins , we noticed that several eukaryotic members appear to be inactivated proteases , as indicated by the loss of the predicted catalytic serine or histidine ( figure 1 , and data not shown ) ; these inactivated forms could be regulators of active rhomboid proteases .\nseveral other proteins lack one or more of the conserved residues in tmh3 ; it remains unclear whether or not these are active proteases . bacterial and archaeal members of the rhomboid superfamily contain six tmh , whereas the eukaryotic members typically have an additional seventh tmh , which may be attached to the core either from the amino terminus or from the carboxyl terminus as discussed below .\nthe phyletic distribution pattern of the rhomboid family shows that this intramembrane protease is extremely common in all three kingdoms of life , but is not necessarily essential for cell function .\nrhomboids are missing in the microsporidian encephalitozoon cuniculi , a eukaryotic intracellular parasite with a highly degraded genome , the archaea methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus and thermoplasma volcanium , and several bacterial species , primarily parasites with small genomes but also species with moderately sized genomes , such as xylella fastidiosum ( see cog0705 at ) . in two instances ,\na representative of the rhomboid family is present in only one of a pair of relatively close genomes ( present in t. acidophilum but missing in t. volcanium ; present in the spirochete treponema pallidum but missing in the related bacterium borrelia burgdorferi ) , which suggests relatively recent , repeated losses of this gene .\nmost of the prokaryotic species have a single gene coding for a rhomboid - family protein , although some have two or three paralogs ( see cog0705 ) ; in contrast , eukaryotes show expansion of the rhomboid family , with seven members in drosophila , and as many as 13 in arabidopsis .\nthe multiple alignment of the 6-tmh core of the rhomboid family ( figure 1 ) was employed to construct a phylogenetic tree using the least - squares algorithm with subsequent optimization using the maximum likelihood ( ml ) method ( see materials and methods ) .\nonly the conserved regions including the tmh and short adjacent stretches shown in figure 1 were used as the input for tree building , whereas the poorly conserved intervening regions were omitted to avoid noise from potentially misaligned residues ( except for the bayesian analysis , which used the complete alignment ; see materials and methods ) .\nthe phylogenetic tree of the rhomboid family presents a complex and unexpected picture ( figure 2 ) .\nneither the eukaryotic nor the archaeal subsets of the family appear to form monophyletic clades . instead\n, the eukaryotic rhomboids are split between two major subfamilies , which are positioned in the midst of different prokaryotic branches ( figure 2 ) .\nthe first subfamily , which includes six of the seven drosophila rhomboids , clusters with a distinct prokaryotic assemblage , consisting primarily of gram - positive bacteria as well as a subset of archaea ; this clade is strongly supported by bootstrap analysis ( figure 2 ) .\nthe proteins in this group of eukaryotic rhomboids , which we designated the rho subfamily , typically have an extra tmh added carboxy - terminally to the 6-tmh core ; some of these proteins also contain ef - hand calcium - binding domains amino - terminally of the core ( figure 2 ) .\nthe second eukaryotic subfamily , which we designated the parl subfamily , after parl , the human ortholog of drosophila rho7 , resides within a large , heterogeneous prokaryotic cluster ( figure 2 ) . within this subfamily , parl and its orthologs from other animals and from fungi\nhave distinct domain architecture , with an extra tmh added to the amino terminus of the core , whereas the rest have only the core ( a carboxy - terminal tmh and a ubiquitin - associated domain are appended in one arabidopsis protein ; figure 2 ) .\nthus , the existence of two distinct subfamilies of eukaryotic rhomboids is supported by features of domain architectures that appear to comprise shared derived characters . within these two major eukaryotic subfamilies ,\nseveral lineage - specific expansions of paralogs   are noticeable , in insects , mammals and plants ( figure 2 ) .\narchaeal rhomboids are scattered over the phylogenetic tree , with two major clusters and , in addition , three isolated proteins joining different bacterial branches ( figure 2 ) .\nthere is no indication of an affinity between any of the archaeal and eukaryotic rhomboids .\nalthough many of the bacterial rhomboids form phylogenetically coherent clusters corresponding to the established bacterial lineages , there are also several clusters that have an odd composition , such as the grouping of proteobacterial and gram - positive species ; some of these clusters are well supported by bootstrap ( see clusters 1 - 4 in figure 2 ) .\nthis concern is particularly serious for highly divergent families of membrane proteins , such as the rhomboids , in which parallel amino - acid substitutions are likely .\ntherefore we investigated the phylogeny of the rhomboid family in greater detail using several independent phylogenetic methods and the corresponding statistical tests .\nfirst , we assessed the robustness of the topology of the tree shown in figure 2 using the kishino -

hgt scenario seemed to be supported by several methods of tree analysis and statistical tests .\neukaryotes probably acquired their two major rhomboid subfamilies , rho and parl , as the result of two independent , early hgt events .\nthese events , which might have introduced rip as a means of intercellular communication , could have been pivotal in the evolution of eukaryotic multicellularity along the lines discussed previously with regard to the apparent bacterial origin of key components of eukaryotic programmed cell death machinery .\nsubsequent evolution of rhomboids in eukaryotes proceeded by lineage - specific expansion of paralogs   followed by diversification through the addition of an extra tmh in different positions relative to the catalytic core , some limited domain accretion ( see figure 2 ) and sequence divergence .\nphylogenetic analysis of the rhomboid family described here carries a general message for studies aimed at the reconstruction of ancestral life forms , particularly luca .\nalthough most of the ( nearly ) ubiquitous protein families probably do derive from luca , explicit phylogenetic analysis is required to ascertain this in each case .\nthe nonredundant ( nr ) protein sequence database at the national center for biotechnology information ( nih , bethesda ) was searched iteratively using the psi -

{"id": 112, "text": "an infliction in the life expectancy figure of patients with sickle cell disease ( scd ) occurred around the middle of the 1970s ( fig .\nthis minimal increase in life expectancy coincided with my appointment at thomas jefferson university as the associate director of the newly created adult sickle cell center .\nthe number of adults at that time was small and the transition from pediatrics to adult programs was at the age of 18 years .\nthe trickle of patients increased gradually and we were faced with adolescent and young adult african american patients who were in a state of confusion .\nstripped from the protective sphere of the pediatric world and the empathy of their pediatric hematologists and the pediatric ancillary staff , they were in a state of fear , anxiety , depression and , worst of all , severe pain .\nthe fact that most patients were barely educated , many without a high school degree , unemployed , mediocre health coverage , and dysfunctional family structure conferred a logarithmic dimension to the problem .\nthe arrow indicates the infliction point where life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease began to increase .\nthe steady stream of admissions of patients with acute painful vaso - occlusive crises ( vocs ) to the emergency department ( ed ) and hospital were not welcome by most providers , hospital administration , the house and nursing staffs .\nthere was subtle resentment of the patients that sometimes extended to the hematologists who showed compassion to the patients . soon labels such as drug addicts , drug - seeking behavior , and hospital hopping and frequent flyer emerged .\nlistening to and believing the patients and keeping detailed records of ed and hospital admissions and the analgesics prescribed , revealed that most patients genuinely do not respond to a certain analgesic or a certain dose . increasing the doses of an analgesic or switching to another drug solved the problem in most patients .\naccordingly and with the approval of the institutional review board ( irb ) , i issued an identification wallet - sized , plasticized card that was carried by patients and presented to the provider treating their voc in the ed , hospital or any other medical facility .\ninformation printed on both sides of the card included : 1 ) demographic data and a recent photograph ; 2 ) hematological data including reticulocyte count ; 3 ) medical data including the type of scd , its complications and co - morbidities if present ; 4 ) all medications being taken by the patient and the recommended treatment of vocs including the name , dose , and the route of administration of the analgesics in question ; and 5 ) my name and contact information for answering questions if needed .\nit was not expensive to issue these cards . a polaroid camera available at that time and a laminator were the only equipments needed to issue these cards .\nlater on , information on the card was computerized and a printed copy was given to the patient .\nthe patients were very compliant in carrying it as faithfully as they carry their medical cards .\nsome providers liked it very much because it facilitated having a concise history about the patients .\nwhile this controversy was brewing , interesting developments in basic science were in progress to understand the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids .\nin the 1970s , it was hypothesized that opioids have receptors to bind to and activate in order to relieve pain   by blocking or minimizing the transmission of painful stimuli and raising the pain threshold .\nit did not take long after that to identify opioids as ligands that bind to stereospecific and saturable receptors in the central nervous system and other tissues [ 3 , 4 ] .\nin addition , recent elegant studies [ 6 - 10 ] have revealed a helical structure of the opioid receptors , which forms pockets in which the corresponding opioid ( ligand ) fits snugly ( fig .\nrecognition is highly specific , such that only l - isomers of certain opioids exert analgesic activity .\nphysiologically , by binding to receptors , opioids initiate a series of biochemical events including activation of g proteins , inhibition of adenylate cyclase , and extrusion of potassium ions , resulting in hyperpolarization of cell membranes [ 14 - 16 ] ; this delays or prevents transmission of painful stimuli .\nthus , the riddle why some patients respond to one opioid but not another had a pathophysiologic explanation .\n( a ) morphine - like molecule ( yellow ) in the deep pocket ( blue ) of the -opioid receptor .

{"id": 113, "text": "the potential of rnai to silence any gene has made it an attractive therapeutic modality .\nhowever , the main obstacle to rnai in the clinic is delivery . to be effective\n, sirnas must be transported through the body , bind , and be taken up by target cells where they must traverse the plasma membrane and gain access to the cytosolic compartment , where the rnai machinery resides . to be useful ,\nease of formulation and administration , overall cost , and any associated toxicities are essential considerations .\ndcs are heterogeneous , with subsets defined phenotypically , functionally and by location ( reviewed in ref .\n2 ) . a delivery vehicle that knocks down expression of specific genes in a distinct dc population(s ) would be a valuable tool for targeting diverse diseases including cancers , infectious diseases , autoimmunity and as a vaccine component .\ntherefore , a platform that delivers sirnas to specific dc subsets in situ would be useful for inhibiting or activating immune responses .\nlipid nanoparticles ( lnps ) are one of the most advanced platforms for sirna delivery to hepatocytes , and are under clinical evaluation for conditions that require hepatic gene silencing .\nthese lnps typically contain ionizable cationic lipids ( pka ~6.5 ) that bind nucleic acids via electrostatic interactions at low ph , but are charge neutral at ph 7.4 . as a well - perfused organ\nfurthermore , lnp uptake by hepatocytes is mediated by association with serum apoe leading to efficient uptake via low - density lipoprotein receptors in the liver .\nfollowing cellular uptake of the lnp , the ionization of the lipid within acidic endosomes is thought to promote sirna escape to the cytosol .\nimportantly , these lnps are associated with minimal toxicity , including little induction of proinflammatory cytokines following administration of physiologically relevant doses .\nin contrast to the liver , sirna delivery to extra - hepatic cells is challenging . in particular , immune cells such as dcs are relatively resistant to sirna uptake in vitro and in vivo .\nalthough designed for hepatic gene silencing , the efficacy of these lnps and their derivatives has been assessed for rnai - mediated gene silencing in macrophages ( mos ) and dcs in vitro and in vivo .\nlnp uptake and modest gene silencing was achieved at high doses of lnps ( ~ 5mg / kg ) .\ntogether with a complementary study , this work demonstrates the feasibility of gene silencing in immune cells using lnp technology . clearly\n, however , lnp formulations must be modified to achieve optimal gene silencing in immune cells .\nenhanced uptake of lnps by primary hepatocytes is mediated by apolipoprotein e binding to the neutral lnps .\nthis results in recognition by receptors including the low - density lipoprotein receptor and scavenger receptors largely expressed on hepatocytes .\nthe mechanism of uptake strongly suggests that retargeting of these particles to other receptors or other tissues is possible .\nindeed , akinc et al . demonstrated that lnps modified with n - acetylgalactosamine ( galnac ) were retargeted to the asialoglycoprotein receptor ( asgpr ) expressed by hepatocytes in vivo .\nfor delivery to nonhepatic cells , we have shown in vitro that anti - transferrin receptor aptamers can be used to redirect similar lnps .\nmore recently , liang et al . described a similar approach using aptamer - coated lnps to target osteoblasts in vivo .\nfor uptake by immune cells , a recent study coated lnps with a full - length anti - cd4 antibody for sirna delivery to primary cd4 t cells .\nlnp uptake and gene silencing was observed in cd4 t cells in various organs including the spleen , lymph nodes , and blood .\nthese studies demonstrate the potential for attaching exogenous ligands to lnps for delivery to hepatic , and importantly nonhepatic primary cells in vivo . drawing from these works\n, we reasoned that this lnp platform could be a useful foundation for the delivery of sirnas to dcs to modulate immune responses . to achieve this\n, we modified lnps using a single chain antibody ( scfv ) specific for the dc receptor dec205 , a c - type lectin expressed at high levels on cd8 dcs .\ndec205 dcs mediate cross - presentation of antigen resulting in modulation of cd8 t - cell responses . therefore , inhibition of gene expression by dec205 dcs is a potentially powerful approach for regulating cd8 t - cell activation . using this approach , we assessed the ability of dec - lnps ( lnps coated with scfv specific for murine dec205 , containing sirnas specific for costimulatory molecules ) to inhibit immune responses .\ninjection of dec - lnps resulted in preferential uptake of the dec - lnps by splenic dec205 dcs .\nfurthermore , when coadministered with adjuvant , lnps containing sirna targeting cd40 , cd80 , and cd86 reduced expression of these costimulatory molecules to levels similar to those observed in immature dcs .\nmost importantly , dcs isolated from mice injected with a low dose ( ~0.6  mg / kg ) of these dec - lnps , were able to suppress a robust mixed lymphocyte reaction ( mlr ) , demonstrating the functional efficacy of this approach .\ninterestingly , when we performed experiments using 2 ' fluoro ( 2'f ) modified sirna , a formulation reported to be nonimmunostimulatory and nonimmunogenic , significant immune activation of the targeted dcs was detected . this effect was not observed in assays performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) or monocyte - derived dcs ( modcs ) and could be mitigated through selective 2-o - methyl ( 2ome ) modification of the sirna .\noverall , our study demonstrates the functionality of lnps modified for receptor targeting for sirna delivery to dcs .\nadditionally our results suggest that specific cell targeting can mediate immunological responses to sirna formulations .\nwhile care needs to be taken in designing and evaluating targeted approaches using lnps , we found that 2ome modification of the sirna was sufficient to negate immune activation .\nour approach enhances the efficacy of sirna - mediated gene silencing by ~10-fold when compared to nontargeted delivery .\ntherefore , this targeted strategy should prove effective for regulating multiple immune - mediated diseases .\nlnps containing sirnas specific either for cd80 , cd86 , cd40 , or a control ( nontarget ) sequence were synthesized by extrusion using a mixture of 1,2-distearoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dspc):dlindma : dspe - peg : cholesterol at a ratio of 15:40:5:40 ( based on refs .\nmurine anti - dec205 scfv with a c - terminal cysteine was attached to the lipid dspe - peg by a maleimide group ( figure 1a , b ) . following synthesis , we subjected lnps to quality control to ensure consistency between batches .\ndynamic light scattering was used to determine diameter and polydispersity of lnps , and cryo - electron microscopy confirmed lnp size and their unilamellar structure ( figure 1c , d ) .\nthe efficiency of sirna incorporation and scfv binding to dspe - peg was also assessed ( figure 1c , e ) . to show specificity of binding to dec205 ,\nscfv - lnps containing dy547-labeled sirna were cultured with either parental ( dec205 ) or dec205 cho cells . as seen in figure 2a , at 4 c dec205 cells bind dec - lnps approximately fourfold better compared with nontargeted lnps ( nt - lnps : lnps not coated with any scfv ) , or lnps coated with an isotype scfv ( iso - lnps ; cho - dec205 panel ) . when similar assays were performed at 37 c to allow cell uptake , cell staining increased by at least fivefold .\nlittle uptake was observed when lnps ( targeted or nontargeted ) were incubated with parental cho cells ( cho panel ) .\nsimilar results were obtained when bone marrow - derived dcs ( bmdcs ) , derived from wild - type mice ( b6 ) were incubated with dec - lnps .\nwe note that as dec205 is expressed at lower levels on bmdcs compared with cho - dec205 , less dec - lnp binding and uptake was observed in bmdcs ( ~2-fold enhancement compared with nt- or iso - lnps ; b6 bmdc panel ) . to further confirm target - specific uptake we performed experiments using bmdcs derived from dec205 mice , and no specific cell binding or uptake\nthe dec205 antibody is internalized via receptor - mediated endocytosis , and is targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes .\nconfocal microscopy confirmed that similar to dec205 antibody , dec - lnps were targeted to lamp-1 late endosomes or lysosomes ( figure 2b ) .\nhaving demonstrated dec205-mediated uptake of dec - lnps in vitro , we investigated their localization in vivo .\nb6 mice were injected systemically ( intravenous , i.v . ) with fluorescently labeled scfv - lnps .\nas the dec205 receptor is endocytosed when it binds its ligand , we could not use this molecule to identify dec205 dcs .\ntherefore , we used cd8 , a protein that is coexpressed on dec205 dcs , as a surrogate marker for tracking these cells .\nmore than 50% of cd11ccd8 cells took up dec - lnps , and uptake was largely restricted to the cd8 dc population , with little uptake observed by cd8 dcs ( figure 3a , b ) .\nspecificity was demonstrated by comparison of uptake of dec - lnps and iso - lnps .\nsignificant uptake was only observed in dec205 dcs following dec - lnp injection , and other splenic immune cells took up little dec- or iso - lnps ( figure 3a , c ) . when dec - lnps were injected into dec205 mice ,\nno uptake was detected ( figure 3d ) . to show that dec - lnps were competent for specific gene silencing , we generated dec - lnps containing a sirna specific for cd80 ( having identified the most effective sirna sequence ; see supplementary figure s1 ) and injected into b6 mice .\ncd11cdec205 cells took up similar amounts of lnps following injection with dec - lnp containing either cd80- or control - sirna ( lnp uptake panel , mean fluorescence intensity ( mfi ) : dec - lnp - control = 443 versus dec - lnp - sicd80 = 464 ) . in mice injected with dec - lnp encapsulating cd80-specific sirna , cd80 protein expression approached basal levels , and was reduced by ~2-fold when compared with dec - lnp containing control - sirna ( figure 4a ) .\na 75% reduction in cd80 mrna was observed in dec205 dcs that had taken up dec - lnps containing cd80-specific sirna ( compared with dec - lnps containing control sirnas ; figure 4b ) .\nwe confirmed that gene knockdown was rnai - mediated using 5 race to detect sirna - directed mrna cleavage products ( figure 4c ) .\nsequencing of the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) fragment verified that it was derived from cd80 mrna and that the cut site corresponded with nucleotide positions 1011 of the sirna guide strand ( not shown ) .\ninterestingly , while the data in figure 4 demonstrate the ability of our dec - lnps to effectively knockdown cd80 expression in dcs in vivo , we observed significant dc activation following injection of dec - lnps containing control sirnas ( figure 4a , right panel ) .\nthis observation was surprising considering these experiments were performed using sirnas containing 2f modified rna , previously reported to have reduced immunostimulatory activity . to better assess this effect , we synthesized a series of luciferase - specific control sirnas ( luc ) containing 2oh rna ( unmodified ) , 2f pyrimidines or selected 2ome modifications ( see methods for modification strategy ; based on refs .\nlnps were generated and their ability to stimulate immune responses using multiple assays was examined .\nfirst , b6 mice were injected with dec - lnps that contained either unmodified , 2f or 2ome modified luc - specific sirnas in the absence of any adjuvant .\none day later , splenic dcs were analyzed for the expression of costimulatory receptors ( supplementary figure s2a ) .\nas expected , dcs isolated from mice that had received unmodified sirnas demonstrated significant upregulation of cd40 , cd80 , and cd86 .\nconsistent with our previous results ( figure 4a ) , animals treated with dec - lnps containing 2f modified sirnas also upregulated these costimulatory molecules . importantly , and similar to work by other groups , we found that 2ome modified sirnas induced minimal immune activation . to attempt to circumvent the need for a time and resource intensive in vivo assay , we wanted to determine whether an in vitro assay could be used to detect immunostimulatory sirnas .\nhowever , when we cultured b6-derived bmdcs with dec - lnps ( containing cd80-specific sirnas ) no difference between 2oh modified sirna , 2f or 2ome modified sirna was detected ( supplementary figure s2b ) .\nwe also used nt - lnps to assess the effects of various sirna formulations on human pbmcs and modcs using standard preclinical assays ( supplementary figure s2c ) .\npbmcs or modcs were cultured for 24 hours at which time cells were assessed for induction of apoptosis and culture supernatants were tested for the presence of proinflammatory cytokines ( see methods ) .\napoptosis was not observed under any conditions tested ( data not shown ) . as expected , pbmcs cultured with the highest concentration of lnps containing unmodified sirnas elicited the secretion of several cytokines .\n2f and 2ome luc sirnas induced production of one cytokine ( il8 ) , also at the highest concentration tested .\nno cytokine production was observed following culture of modcs with lnps encapsulating unmodified , 2f or 2ome sirnas .\ntaken together , these experiments suggest that the assays tested show marked differences in sensitivity . surprisingly , bmdcs and modcs were the least receptive for detecting immunostimulatory sirnas .\nconversely , dec - lnp injection was useful for the identification of sirnas with immune - activating potential . from these results\n, we used sirnas containing selective 2ome substitutions for all subsequent studies . to target autoimmune diseases , reducing the expression of several costimulatory molecules\ntherefore , we next determined the ability of dec - lnps that encapsulated 2ome modified cd86 specific sirnas , to reduce gene expression following i.v . administration ( optimal sirna identified as previously ; supplementary figure s1 ) .\nas the sirnas were 2ome modified , mice were coinjected with lps to stimulate expression of costimulatory molecules .\nanalysis of splenic dec205 dcs 1 day following dec - lnp injection showed reduction of cd86 protein to near steady - state levels ( figure 5a ) .\ntotal rna was isolated from dec205 dcs that had taken up dec - lnps encapsulating either cd86 or control sirnas .\nan approximately 70% reduction in cd86 mrna levels was observed from dcs isolated from mice that received dec - lnps containing cd86 sirna in comparison to dcs derived from control sirna treated mice . to verify knockdown occurred via the rnai pathway ,\nwe next tested whether combining sirnas in dec - lnps would induce gene silencing equivalent to that observed with single sirnas .\na combination of 2ome modified sirnas targeting cd80 , cd86 and cd40 were incorporated into dec - lnps and injected into b6 mice along with adjuvant ( lps ) to activate the dcs .\nreduction of each of the targeted costimulatory molecules was observed , with cd80 and cd86 knocked down to basal levels ( figure 5c ) .\ngene silencing was similar to that achieved following treatment with dec - lnps containing single sirnas ( e.g. , ~50% for cd86 : compare cd86 dec - lnp , figure 5a with mix dec - lnp , figure 5c right panel ) . to determine functional relevance of this knockdown , we used the robust mlr assay .\nb6 mice were injected with dec - lnps encapsulated with either a mix of cd80 , cd86 , and cd40 or control sirnas .\nafter 24 hours , splenic cd8 dcs that had taken up dec - lnps were isolated , irradiated , and cultured with splenic t cells derived from a balb / c mouse .\nmaximal proliferation was observed when dcs were isolated from mice injected with lps only , or lps plus dec - lnps containing control sirnas . in contrast , proliferation of t cells cultured with dcs derived from mice injected with lps plus dec - lnps containing cd80 , cd86 , and cd40 sirnas was significantly reduced ( figure 5d ) .\ncurrently , the most advanced lnp platforms use the ionizable cationic lipid dlindma , or its dlin - kc2-dma and dlin - mc3-dma derivatives .\nfollowing systemic administration , these lnps accumulate in first pass organs , i.e. , liver and spleen , making them attractive vehicles for hepatic gene knockdown .\nfurthermore , these lnps have been shown to safely and effectively reduce expression of hepatocyte genes in clinical trials .\nhowever , there is only very limited data demonstrating targeted delivery of potentially clinically relevant lnps to nonhepatic cells .\nwe have shown that conjugation of a scfv , specific for the dc receptor dec205 , is sufficient to direct delivery of dlindma - formulated dec - lnps to splenic dcs .\nsimilar to conventional nt - lnps , dec - lnps incorporated sirnas with high efficiency ( > 80% ) , and were of uniform diameter ( ~100 nmol / l ) .\nwe found that coating lnps with only ~50 scfv was sufficient for dc delivery ( figures 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .\nwe showed that dec - lnp uptake correlated well with dec205 receptor density : dcs > b cells , t cells and macrophages ( dec205 expression is 1050-fold less than on dcs ) .\nuse of dec205 mice further confirmed that uptake occurred via the dec205 receptor ( figures 2a and 3d ) .\nwe also showed that the intracellular pathway accessed by dec - lnps was consistent with the dec205 pathway ( figure 2b ) .\nimportantly , we demonstrated that targeted delivery resulted in effective rnai - mediated gene silencing of one , or several genes , to essentially basal expression levels ( figures 4 and 5a  c ) .\nthis reduction in gene expression was sufficient to inhibit a robust mlr ( figure 5d ) .\ncoated lnps formulated with the cationic lipid ddab with full - length dec205 antibody for sirna delivery and demonstrated the ability to reduce expression of the costimulatory molecule cd40 in dec205 dcs . while some gene knockdown was achieved , this lipid is known for its adjuvant qualities , and is being developed for applications that require immune response stimulation .\nthe lnps also proved relatively inefficient at sirna loading ( 10% compared with 85% for dlindma lnps ) .\nthe sirnas used were also unmodified , which could serve as another possible source of immune stimulation . therefore , the potential for this formulation appears to be limited .\nmore recently , ramishetti et al . utilized a full - length antibody targeting cd4 to enhance t - cell uptake and induce sirna - mediated gene silencing using a clinically relevant lnp formulation similar to the one we employed in our work .\ninterestingly , both this study and the work from zheng et al . chose to utilize full - length antibodies for lnp targeting , which may limit their utility when considering the immunogenicity of whole antibodies and their rapid clearance from the circulation by fc - mediated uptake by macrophages .\nin fact , in preliminary studies , we coated lnps with full - length dec205 antibody and failed to observe uptake by dec205 dcs . using our dec - lnps\nmg / kg ) comparable to that study which used n - acetylgalactosamine ( galnac)-coated lnps to target hepatocytes via the asialoglycoprotein receptor ( asgpr ) in apoe knockout mice .\nin contrast , when the ability of nt - lnps to silence antigen presenting cells ( apcs ) , including dcs , was investigated a dose of 5  mg / kg was required to achieve partial silencing : ~10-fold higher when compared with our dec - lnps .\nfurthermore , the authors used the dlindma derivative , dlin - kc2-dma , which displays improved silencing ability in hepatocytes ( relative ed50 dlin - kc2-dma : 0.1  mg / kg versus dlindma : 1  mg / kg ) . as these lnps were formulated for effective gene silencing in hepatocytes ,\nbiodistribution studies show that nt - lnps are found in the spleen , although at ~50-fold less than in the liver . while targeting ligands\nhave been shown to have little effect on the overall biodistribution of nanoparticle formulations , they can enhance cell - specific uptake . therefore , while high doses of nt - lnps can confer partial gene silencing in apcs , at low lnp concentrations , we find that a targeted approach is required to achieve knockdown in a specific dc subset\n. injection of low - dose nt - lnps failed to result in detectable uptake / gene silencing .\nas the rnai pathway is resident in the cytoplasm , the intracellular pathway used following receptor ligation is an important consideration .\nwe chose the well - characterized dec205 receptor for targeting our lnps . following binding ,\nthe internalized receptor is routed to late endosomes and associated cargo gains access to the cytoplasm .\nthe dlindma lipid fuses with anionic phospholipids present in the endosomal membrane resulting in release of encapsulated cargo into the cytoplasm .\nhowever , it is likely that different routes of uptake will affect the efficiency of delivery and subsequent gene silencing . thus , a logical extension to our approach is to determine whether we observe improved gene silencing using other dc specific targeting agents and/or more effective dlindma derivatives .\nwe are currently investigating the efficacy of dec - lnps formulated with the dlin - mc3-dma ( ed50 0.03  mg / kg ) .\nhaving demonstrated that we could efficiently target sirnas to dcs , the lack of toxicity of these lnps and their cargo had to be established .\nwe observed significant dc activation following injection of targeted lnps containing unmodified and 2f modified sirnas , and incorporation of 2ome modifications at distinct residues was required to maintain costimulatory molecules analyzed at basal levels ( figure 4a and supplementary figure s2a ) .\nas injecting mice to determine immune stimulation is time and resource intensive , we assessed immune stimulation in murine and human tissue culture systems .\nmurine bmdcs were refractory to lnp stimulation suggesting they would not serve as a useful surrogate for gauging immunogenicity of lnps .\ntaken together , these assays demonstrate a requirement for in vivo analysis to uncover the stimulatory capacity of the lnps .\nrecently , a human whole blood cytokine assay has been described that showed similar activation profiles elicited by lnps when compared with in vivo injection , potentially circumventing a requirement for cumbersome in vivo analyses . for the purposes of inhibiting a multifactorial immune response , such as that observed in graft rejection or autoimmunity , the simultaneous knockdown of several ( co)stimulatory genes\nthis approach has been used to demonstrate that combining antibodies targeting cd80 and cd86 can reduce disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and in antigen - induced arthritis .\ntransfer of dcs treated ex vivo with cd40 , cd80 , and cd86 antisense oligonucleotides ( as - odn ) into nod mice delayed type 1 diabetes ( t1d ) onset .\na follow - up study demonstrated that multiple injections of microspheres containing cd40 , cd80 , and cd86 as - odns were sufficient to prevent t1d , possibly due to reduced expression of the costimulatory molecules by splenic dcs .\nwe achieve significant reduction in expression of cd40 , cd80 , and cd86 on splenic dcs using our dec - lnps following systemic delivery , and ongoing studies are addressing the durability of gene knockdown and the potential use of these dec - lnps for treating autoimmune diseases . in summary\n, we have shown that a clinically relevant lnp can be modified for cell - specific delivery of sirnas . in vivo administration\ndid not produce overt inflammatory responses , and we achieved significant rnai - mediated gene - specific knockdown at low sirna doses .\nthese attributes make this an attractive platform to warrant further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for various autoimmune diseases .\nfurthermore , judicious selection of the ligand coating the lnp opens up the potential for targeting multiple cell types .\nmice . c57bl/6 ( b6 ) and balb / c mice were purchased from taconic ( hudson , ny ) .\ndec205 mice were bred to homozygosity on the b6 background ( dec205 ) , and validated by pcr and flow cytometry .\nmice were housed in the barrier facility at the institute for animal studies , albert einstein college of medicine ( bronx , ny ) according to institutional animal care and use committee ( iacuc ) guidelines .\nthe single - chain fragment variable ( scfv ) antibodies constructed for dec205 ( clone nldc145 ) and isotype ( clone gl117 ) were cloned from antibody constructs , as previously described .\nthe variable regions of the heavy and light chain sequences were fused with a flexible linker ( g4s)6 separating them and cloned into a pet28a ( emd millipore , billerica , ma ) bacterial expression vector .\nfurther modifications to the constructs included a strep -

or is the patient 's ability to understand , retain , and use or weigh what the likely costs and benefits of treatment will be for them , currently compromised ? scrutinizing a patient 's commitments in the context of a capacity assessment raises moral concerns because the possibility that a choice can be explained by idiosyncratic commitments plays a significant role in protecting the patient 's right to make controversial decisions .\nperhaps the most straightforward approach to conceiving of commitments , and the one most likely to protect this right , is to say that the person 's commitments are their current commitments  those they recognize at the time of the decision .\nthe problem with conceiving of commitments in this way is that it fails to recognise certain problems of practical decision - making to do with motivational coherence over time .\nsomeone with bipolar disorder , for example , might clearly be choosing or acting in accordance with their current desires during a manic phase , but this perspective fails to capture what seemingly goes wrong with practical decision - making in such cases . as a result , if this understanding of commitments is adopted in assessments of mental capacity the reach of this area of law arguably does not extend as far as it should  a person may be judged to have mental capacity where this seems doubtful .\npsychopathologies characterised by this kind of problem seem better accounted for in a legal structure that conceives of mental capacity , and in particular , commitments , in diachronic terms .\na diachronic perspective might also help illuminate some other hard cases that are not normally characterised in terms of problems of motivational coherence over time .\nfor example , someone with anorexia nervosa may be choosing rationally in accordance with their current commitments  especially a strong desire not to gain weight , or to exert extreme control over what they eat  and so may be judged to have capacity on these grounds . however , an assessment of their evaluative capacities in diachronic terms might yield the conclusion that their decision - making ability is seriously compromised ( craigie , 2011 ) .\ntheir future self may come to the view that they should have been motivated in ways that they could not recognise or could not act on at the time , and this might be a fairly robust feature of people with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa .\nthis perspective in relation to questions of mental capacity chimes with the suggestion that particularly in psychiatry ,  colloquialisms [ such as ]  you will thank me later  sometimes become the unwritten rules within which the merits of a patient 's consent are assessed ( gostin , 1981 , p. 742 ) .\nsuch a perspective may also offer a solution in cases where the patient does not have a psychiatric diagnosis .\nmackenzie and watts discuss a case of a woman who was judged to have the capacity to refuse life - saving treatment , and subsequently died , in a situation where she had recently been left by her husband , following the amputation of both her legs .\nthey argue that the trauma of these events and her subsequent inability to imagine a life without her partner clouded the woman 's judgment in relation to treatment:the tragedy is that in this case therapy or treatment might have corrected her assumptions regarding future quality of life , and a decision to accept the lifesaving treatment might have resulted. ( 2011 , p. 33\n; for a full description of the case , see halpern , 2012)differences between these cases suggest that taking a diachronic perspective in assessments of mental capacity allows for decision - making to be compromised in at least two ways . in the bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa cases a diachronic perspective is used to argue that a person 's evaluative capacities may be compromised  the capacities that determine the desires or values that motivate a decision . in the emotional trauma case , which might equally be applied to cases of depression , a diachronic perspective is used to identify a problem in the person 's ability to assess whether what they want or value is achievable . according to jodi halpern 's original analysis of the emotional trauma case , the woman should have been judged to lack capacity on grounds that her beliefs about the future were  unresponsive to evidence , rendering her unable to  think through alternatives ( halpern , 2012 , pp .\n the tragedy is that in this case therapy or treatment might have corrected her assumptions regarding future quality of life , and a decision to accept the lifesaving treatment might have resulted. ( 2011 , p. 33\n; for a full description of the case , see halpern , 2012 ) one problem with adopting a diachronic perspective in assessments of mental capacity is that whether questions of procedural rationality are properly understood in diachronic terms remains a contested issue in the fields of economics , psychology and philosophy .\nthe functional element of the mca 's incapacity test concerns problems in meeting certain procedural requirements  problems in the ability to understand , retain , use or weigh relevant information .\nsceptics deny that at least some norms derived from a diachronic perspective fall into this category .\nthey hold that such requirements are substantive rather than procedural in nature , so i turn now to this theoretical concern .\nmuch of the normative and descriptive work on a diachronic perspective in personal decision - making has taken place in the fields of economics and psychology , but these fields have tended to adopt contrasting positions on the normative question .\neconomists often treat a person 's weighting of the future as a preference like any other , in a framework that assumes that preferences are not available to rational criticism .\nprudence to refer to taking a diachronic perspective in decision - making:prudence can not on this view be explained merely by the perception that something is in one 's future interest ; there must be a desire to further one 's future interests if the perception is to have an effect \nthere seems little doubt that most people have the desire that makes prudence possible [ however , according to this view we are not ] in any sense required to possess the desires in question : consequently we are not required to act on the specified considerations . if one lacks the relevant desire , there is nothing more to be said .\n ( nagel , 1970 , p. 28)psychologists , on the other hand , often assume that people are rationally required to give significant weight to the future personal consequences of choices , the strongest version being that people ought to be temporally neutral in their decision - making .\nit is widely accepted within this camp that there are at least some good reasons to give less weight to future consequences , particularly in order to take into account an expected depreciation in their future value .\n. however , foreseeable changes in one 's circumstances can also be relevant :  50 might be much more valuable to a final year law student than  100 will be for them in the following year , when they reasonably expect to be working for a corporate lawyer . on these grounds\nit might be rational for the student to choose  50 now , foregoing  100 in a year 's time .\nlikewise , it is argued that uncertainly with respect to future consequences can provide a good reason to choose a certain outcome now , over a more valuable but uncertain outcome in the future ( baron , 1994 , pp .\ni am using the term  temporally neutral to refer to decisions that give equal weight to future and present utility , excepting the above kinds of considerations .\nthe pressing question is why people ought to be impartial with respect to all parts of their lives once these kinds of consideration are taken into account . \nprudence can not on this view be explained merely by the perception that something is in one 's future interest ; there must be a desire to further one 's future interests if the perception is to have an effect \nthere seems little doubt that most people have the desire that makes prudence possible [ however , according to this view we are not ] in any sense required to possess the desires in question : consequently we are not required to act on the specified considerations . if one lacks the relevant desire , there is nothing more to be said .\n ( nagel , 1970 , p. 28 ) the arguments used to defend this position in the psychological literature tend to take the form that a temporally neutral orientation advances the goals of practical decision - making .\nchoosing an outcome merely because it will happen sooner is said to be irrational because if one option  achieves your goals better , then you should choose that one , regardless of when you decide ( baron , 1994 , p. 514 ) . using the classic marshmallow experiments as an example ,\nif a child would rather eat two marshmallows than one , then they should choose to wait and be given two marshmallows sometime later rather than one marshmallow now  because overall this achieves the child 's goals better .\nthis kind of argument considers the question of goal satisfaction from a position that is not situated at a particular point in time , and prescribes that people ought to take this perspective in their decision - making :  they should be just as concerned about themselves a year from now as they are about themselves this minute ( p. 516 )\n. individuals should give weight to the implications for their future self , so the argument goes , for their own overall good .\nnagel argues that prudence is a requirement of practical reason , which is secured because the personal consequences of a man 's action concern  his future ( 1970 , p. 42 ; his italics ) .\naccording to nagel , this constraint on practical decision - making follows from the person 's awareness that they persist over time .\nit reflects the  individual 's conception of himself as a temporally persistent being : his ability to identify with past and future stages of himself and to regard them as forming a single life .\nfailure to be susceptible to prudence entails radical dissociation from one 's future , one 's past , and from oneself as a whole , conceived as a temporally extended individual ( p. 58 ) .\nit is a mistake in practical reasoning because it comes  at the cost of dissociation from one 's temporally extended self ( p. 69 ) .\nthe conception of self as extended throughout a human lifetime is powerful in the context of questions of procedural rationality because it offers grounds for claiming that a person ought to give weight to considerations that they may not currently care about .\nit offers an answer to what i have characterised as the economists ' view , that if a person has no interest in the future personal consequences of their choice there is nothing more to be said , rationally speaking .\napplied to the context of treatment decision - making , this kind of perspective is powerful because it offers grounds for calling a patient 's mental capacity into question , with reference to their ability to consider their future and value it appropriately .\nrejections of this kind of rational requirement are therefore often based on a rejection of the idea of the self as something that necessarily extends throughout a lifetime , and derek parfit 's account of personal identity is often used to make this argument ( baron , 1994 , p. 516 ; frederick , 2006 ; maclean , 2006 ) .\nparfit holds that the persistence of a person over time must be understood in terms of their \npsychological continuity  the connectedness of psychological features such as memories , character , interests and preferences across a lifetime ( parfit , 1983 ; 1984 ) . on this view , whether the future inhabitant of one 's body will be the same person can be a matter of degree . psychological features sometimes change so radically over a human lifetime that a person now will not necessarily be the same person who occupies that body in the future . and\nnot giving weight to the interests of a future self is irrational only to the degree that one shares the relevant psychological characteristics with that self .\nmore recently , galen strawson has defended a similar position in his rejection of narrative accounts of the self .\nstrawson argues that although experiencing oneself as one person throughout a lifetime  what he calls a \ndiachronic self - experience  may be more common , some people experience themselves in what he describes as a more  episodic way . unlike the more diachronic person ,\nthe more episodic person has  little or no sense that the self that one is was there in the ( further ) past and will be there in the future , although one is perfectly aware that one has long - term continuity considered as a whole human being ( strawson , 2005 , p. 65 ) .  [ predominantly ] episodic individuals may sometimes connect to charged events in their pasts in such a way that they feel those events happened to them  embarrassing memories are a good example  and anticipate events in their futures in such a way that they think those events are going to happen to them  thoughts of death can be a good example \nhowever , the episodic person has no  great or special interest in [ their ] past , and nor do they have  a great deal of concern for [ their ] future ( p. 67 ) .\nstrawson holds that even a strongly episodic self is within the normal range of human experience , and that it is normatively on a par with a more diachronic self - experience . on his view\n, theorists such as nagel assert that selves extend over a lifetime , and diachronic norms of procedural rationality are derived from this claim .\nparfit and strawson dispute this assumption , and conclude that disregard for the future personal consequences of a choice may simply reflect an alternative way of living a human life , at least when we consider the question of reasons for action in non - moral terms .\nhowever , all of the theorists canvassed thus far reason from premises about the extension of self over a lifetime , to conclusions about what reasons individuals have , and it will be argued here that this conception of the relationship between the requirements of practical rationality and the metaphysics of self is the wrong way around . as described above , the kind of requirement in question is often defended  by nagel and others  on the grounds that not giving weight to the future undermines one 's own interests . however , at times a different kind of argument is suggested in nagel 's work .\nthe suggestion seems to be that a unified self over a lifetime is not something that is automatically present , but rather something that is generated by giving weight to future personal consequences in decision - making .\nthe proposed requirement is justified , not because it deploys the correct conception of self , or because one 's future self will otherwise regret the decision , but because adherence plays a role in bringing the self into being , by enabling the decision - maker  to reach towards something outside himself ( nagel , 1970 , p. 43 ) .\nmichael bratman is particularly clear about the role that he proposes giving weight to the future plays in the generation of the self , and how this in turn grounds a diachronic perspective on questions of procedural rationality , so it is his view that i will focus on here .\n self - governing policies  which are integral to temporally extended agency  lie at the core of human agency because it is through these that a person 's identity emerges .\nthese processes are essential for understanding what it is for an agent to  take a stand  what it is for an agent to recognise certain desires as one 's own  and it is this feature in particular that distinguishes human agency from the agency of other  purposive creatures ( bratman , 2000 , pp .\nadopting broadly the same approach to personal identity as parfit begins with , bratman suggests that the forward - looking psychological ties that play a role in constituting a unified self over time can be generated through reflective and planning processes : \ni can help ensure appropriate psychological continuities and connections by sticking with and executing my prior plans and policies , and by monitoring and regulating my motivational structures in favor , say , of my continued commitment to philosophy \nsuch processes  play an important role in the constitution and support of continuities and connections characteristic of the identity of the agent over time. \nindeed, bratman suggests ,  this is what plans and policies are for ( 2000 , p. 47\nby emphasising the role that planning and policy - making play in generating the psychological ties that are proposed to underpin personal identity over time , bratman describes a picture of human agency in which the agent plays an active role . the temporally extended self develops through the agent 's exercise of certain psychological capacities . on this point bratman\nmakes a significant departure from parfit and strawson , who seem to hold that the degree to which the relevant psychological ties extend over time is a fixed fact about the individual , from which rational requirements on their action may be derived .\nthe claim that engaging in planning and policy - making processes is rationally required is defended primarily on the non - instrumental grounds that these processes play a central role in developing and sustaining the self .\nbratman 's argument takes the form of an answer to the problem that agents who reflect on their first - order desires and form second - order desires do not yet exhibit what is distinctive about human agency , because there is nothing to distinguish these new desires as those that the agent identifies with ; second - order desires seem to be \njust one more wiggle in the psychic stew ( bratman , 2000 , p. 38 ) .\nthe solution that bratman offers is that where an agent stands with respect to a particular first - order desire is established through the exercise of planning and policy - making practices :  self - governing policies might , so to speak , crystallize pressures from various elements of one 's psychic stew into a more decisive attitude that can , in the relevant context , establish where one stands ( 2000 , p. 51 ) .\nthese mental processes that underpin temporally extended agency give authority to particular desires , so it is through these that the self  the distinctive feature of human agency  emerges . on this view , a compromised ability to engage in planning and policy - making processes threatens not the interests of the future self , but the very constitution of the self .\nthis is what grounds the procedural requirement that one must give weight to the future personal consequences of actions . and this , we might suggest , is what makes the ability to consider and value the future an appropriate consideration to include in a mental capacity test .\nbratman 's account offers a story about the self that fits well with a developmental understanding of personhood that is often appealed to in contemporary medical law and ethics .\nhis account of the relationship between temporally extended agency and the self also fits well with the difficulties associated with certain psychopathologies .\nit is no accident , i suggest , that disorders such as dementia , bipolar disorder and depression are associated with seriously compromised capacities for diachronic agency . among many other factors , in a complex picture , problems of diachronic agency surely make a contribution to our sense that these constellations of behavioural and experiential features are appropriate targets for the label of disorder .\na sense of the self as compromised in the context of problems of diachronic agency is also found in first - person reports of dementia ( addis and tippett , 2004 ; however , see caddell and clare , 2012 ) and depression ( fuchs , 2008 ; ratcliffe , 2012 ) .\nit would seem that the functioning of capacities for diachronic agency is connected to our sense of others as having well - functioning human agency , as well as our subjective sense of selfhood , and for these reasons\ni find it implausible that a strongly episodic self - experience is just a less common way of living a human life .\nstrawson defends a view along these lines , claiming that he himself is strongly episodic ( in his sense ) .\nyet he has a successful academic career which could not have been achieved without meeting a wide range of commitments that each extended over considerable periods of time , for example in completing academic qualifications and writing books .\nit seems to me that these achievements evidence considerable skills in diachronic agency . while for strawson a diachronic self - experience is connected to a narrative conception of the self , diachronicity in the sense concerned here\na life lived in the moment could still be a life lived with diachronic agency , as i will argue at the end of the following section .\ni now turn back to questions of mental capacity and what implications a diachronic perspective such as bratman 's would have .\nthe motivation for investigating these theoretical questions about procedural rationality was the idea that a diachronic perspective might enable a mental capacity test such as that adopted in the mca to deal with certain hard cases , particularly in the context of mental disorder , without undermining its value - neutral approach .\nthe arguments above suggest that a diachronic perspective on questions of mental capacity is consistent with a procedural understanding of the functional element of the mca 's incapacity test .\ngiven this , could a diachronic understanding of what it is to have mental capacity help by justifying the inclusion of a requirement such as the ability to consider the future  as a part of what it means to be able to understand , retain , use or weigh information  in assessments of mental capacity ?\nsomething like this requirement already seems to be assumed in the condition that the patient must understand the consequences of the treatment options .\nthe relevant information necessarily concerns the future as well as the present , due to the fact that understanding  the likely effects of deciding one way or the other is a part of this requirement ( mental capacity act 2005 code of practice , s. 4.16 ) .\nfor example , a person with a severe learning disability might be judged to lack the capacity to consent to a blood test on grounds that they do not understand that the test is necessary for their future physical well - being .\nthe same might be said in a case of a delirious patient who is resisting treatment for a serious injury . in such cases the person 's connection to the world , in the sense of their ability to understand how things are likely to be in the future ,\nwhat to do is limited in a way that can be compared to john stuart mill 's paradigm case of justified paternalistic intervention , where a person is about to cross a bridge that unbeknownst to them is unsafe\n. the person in the example does not understand that they risk falling into water if they attempt to cross .\nthe widely accepted conclusion is that the person is not in a position to assess whether to cross the bridge , and this justifies the use of proportional physical force to stop them from crossing , when this is necessary to inform them about the state of the bridge .\nthe same reasoning might be applied in the case of the woman who has recently suffered a serious emotional trauma , on grounds that her ability to imagine a range of future possibilities is severely limited ( halpern , 2012 ) .\nthe patient can not currently conceive of alternative futures to the desperately unhappy one she imagines , and perhaps this justifies taking the decision out of her hands until she is seeing things more clearly .\nthe problem that returns here is that understanding concerns not simply how things are likely to be , as in the fact that an attempt to cross the bridge is likely to result in a fall into water , or that a certain proportion of people who have both legs amputated learn to walk again using prosthetic limbs .\nit concerns understanding how the relevant state of affairs will be for this particular patient .\nthis question about the future necessarily involves an evaluative judgment that , according to a value - neutral approach , only the patient is in a position to make .\nso while it might sometimes be clear that a patient 's ability to consider the future is compromised , for example when someone denies that their condition is life - threatening when it clearly is , in many cases assessing understanding in relation to the future will have no equivalent point of reference .\nin such a context there seems to be no standard against which the functional element of the mental capacity test  the part concerning the patient 's ability to understand , retain , use or weigh information  can be directly assessed .\ntherefore , any conclusions drawn about this capacity would seem to be based on the fact that the patient has suffered an emotional trauma . removing a patient 's right to make their own treatment decision under these circumstances may seem justified given what we know about how people who lose limbs adapt , as reflected in self - reported measures of well - being , and given the known psychological effects of emotional trauma\n. however , an appeal to this kind of knowledge in an assessment of mental capacity would involve using generalised observations to draw a conclusion about a particular person 's capacity to assess how things will be for them in the future .\nthe legislation is clear that an assessment of decision - making ability should not be based solely on features such as a patient 's diagnosis .\nit must be shown that this particular person 's mental capacities are relevantly impaired , not merely that they belong to a diagnostic category . however\n, this requirement can not be met in the case of this capacity , because there is no way to directly assess it while remaining value neutral in accordance with the aspirations of this area of law . what about the possibility raised at the beginning of this article , that a person 's evaluative capacities might be called into question when viewed from a diachronic perspective ?\ndrawing on bratman 's account , planfulenss and self - governing policies are rationally required because of the role they play in developing and sustaining the self .\ncaring about the interests of the future inhabitant of one 's body , and having at least some grip on what those interests will be , seem like prerequisites for engaging successfully in these processes . and perhaps this offers part of an explanation about how decision - making can be compromised in the context of disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder .\nvery crudely , the idea would be that as part of a much bigger picture the capacities necessary for diachronic agency are not functioning properly and this undermines the constitution of the self .\ni have argued that , understood in this way , these considerations are procedural rather than substantive in nature .\nbut would the implementation of these considerations in practice nonetheless come into conflict with the goal of preserving patient autonomy ? assessing a person 's grip on what interests the future inhabitant of their body will have runs into the same difficulties that occurred in the context of assessing understanding in the emotional trauma case . without making substantive assumptions\njudging that a person is likely to lack these capacities in the context of a manic episode may seem justified , because of what we know about the trajectory of bipolar disorder  that fairly reliably people 's commitments during a manic episode radically undermine their overall interests .\nbut whether this kind of consideration provides grounds for a judgment of incapacity in english law depends on what evidence is considered appropriate for assessing the functional element of the incapacity test .\nhowever , as genevra richardson points out ,  existing case law indicates that courts will take a flexible approach to the legal definition [ of capacity ] to enable them to reach their preferred outcome ( richardson , this volume , p. 00 ) .\nthis may mean that in practice significant weight is given to a person 's diagnosis .\nhowever , this solution undermines the protections of patient autonomy conferred by making an individual assessment of functional capacities , rather than diagnosis , the proper grounds for infringements on self - determination .\na related possibility considered at the beginning of this article was that a diachronic perspective might be used to justify giving weight to a reasonable prediction of what the patient 's future self would want in retrospect , in assessments of mental capacity .\nhowever , it does not follow from the view offered here , even given the sure knowledge that a patient 's future self would retrospectively endorse a medical intervention , that their present self is irrational in refusing it . in the imagined case there is an unambiguous conflict between what the patient currently wants ( no treatment ) and what the future self will want in retrospect ( treatment ) . using this conflict to doubt the patient 's current capacity to make the treatment decision assumes that the future self 's perspective should be given greater weight in the current self 's decision - making .\nhowever , there is nothing in the present view that would justify resolving the conflict in this way .\nthe proposed account requires that the agent exercise planfulness and self - governing policies in decision - making , which would seem to involve giving equal weight at most , not greater weight , to one 's expected future desires .\nmoreover , humans have a well - established time preference for negative experiences to be in the past rather than the present or future , and this makes it easier for the patient to endorse involuntary treatment when it is in the past ( doherty , 2011 ) .\nthis would seem to weigh in favour of privileging the perspective of the self who is facing the infringement on liberty . in the absence of any reasons to believe that the future self 's perspective should be privileged\n, this form of justification for doubting mental capacity looks to be question - begging .\nits favouring of the future self 's perspective already assumes that the current self 's decision - making capacity is relevantly impaired .\nfavouring the future self 's perspective might seem justified on grounds that , for example , evaluative capacities are often compromised in the context of certain diagnoses or during experiences such as emotional trauma .\nhowever , at least in theory , this evidence alone does not justify a judgment of incapacity under current english law , for reasons of preserving patient autonomy as argued above .\nfinally , i turn to the question of caring about future personal interests , especially in the context of life - threatening choices .\na central difficulty associated with including a consideration of this kind in questions of mental capacity is the problem of how to assess caring simpliciter , independently of caring about a particular outcome . according to the account offered here , procedural rationality requires that we care about the future personal consequences of choices , but what in the future we should give weight to is left open .\nspecifying this in assessments of mental capacity would mean that the test was not value neutral .\nthe case of the committed smoker ( exemplified by david hockney ) can be used to illustrate the point .\none criticism often levelled at smokers is that they are irrational because they do not care sufficiently about the future personal consequences of their smoking .\nhowever , this criticism assumes that future health , or a long life , is what the person should care about . considering a person 's decision to keep smoking from a value - neutral perspective , which makes no assumptions of this kind ,\nare they being short - sighted ? or do they care about things other than health and long life in a way that makes their decision rational ?\nbratman 's account shows how asking this second question can be consistent with a diachronic perspective on rationality .\nit is clear that the committed smoker is very likely undermining the health of the future inhabitant of his body .\nhowever , it does not follow that he is not engaging in the psychological processes that underpin temporally extended agency .\nit may be a central feature of the person 's life plan that he should not be overly concerned about living a long life\n. his deep and enduring commitment might be to a hedonistic lifestyle that is incompatible with being concerned about health in old age .\nfor such a person , not living fully enough is a more likely source of future regrets than health - endangering behaviours . caring about one 's future might even require , in such a case , life - threatening or health - threatening choices .\nparallel arguments could be made in the case of a decision by a jehovah 's witness to refuse a blood transfusion ; for a political activist 's hunger strike ; for a person who risks their life in an attempt to save a loved one ; and a freediver 's commitment to their dangerous extreme - sports lifestyle .\nthese kinds of decision do not seem characterized by a lack of planfulness about the future . rather than undermining the sense of oneself as  a temporally persisting agent\n, decision - making in line with these kinds of commitment looks likely to contribute to the  overlapping webs of cross - temporal connections and continuities that are proposed to play a role in constituting human agency ( bratman 2000 , pp .\nthe future self taken into consideration in these cases may be a nearer self than in the case of a person who is invested in living a long life  because the artist who is a committed smoker , for example , might not expect to or want to live a long life \nnothing in the above account enjoins us to aim for a life of a particular length .\nwhat it requires is that , at least to some degree , choices be made with a reflectivity about the future , such that insofar as we are agents that agency is temporally extended .\nthis perspective allows us to reconcile the ideas that mental capacity requires that we care about the future personal consequences of our choices , and that life - ending decisions can be made with mental capacity .\nhowever , against this theoretical background , resolving questions about whether a patient 's capacity to care about the future is compromised would seem to require looking beyond their procedural capacities .\nanswers to this question will rest on views about whether or not the life - threatening decision is consistent with the person 's commitments , understood from a diachronic perspective .\nthese factors are taken into account in an assessment of best interests once it is decided that a patient lacks mental capacity ( mca s. 4(6 ) ) .\nhowever , if the ability to care about the future is included as part of what it means to have mental capacity , then consideration of a patient 's commitments from a diachronic perspective will also be central to this prior decision .\nit has been argued here that a diachronic perspective on mental capacity is relevant to questions about when an infringement on treatment decision - making liberty is justified . however , including considerations derived from a diachronic perspective in assessments of capacity comes into conflict with central patient autonomy - preserving features of the mca .\nit 's worth reflecting , then , on why a diachronic perspective might be morally relevant in this context .\ni will suggest that the answer lies in a common view about what makes patient autonomy valuable  what makes it the case that for the most part , people 's treatment decisions , especially their refusals , ought to be respected .\nthe importance of allowing patients to be self - determining in relation to their own medical care is often justified along lines that it\n protects people 's general capacity to lead their lives out of a distinctive sense of their own character , a sense of what is important to and for them ( dworkin , 1994 , p. 224 ) .\ndifferent theorists argue for the value of patient autonomy on importantly different grounds , but a common theme is that treatment decisions should be respected because of their assumed connection to the self .\nhowever , in a case where human agency is seriously compromised in the way described by bratman , selfhood is undermined .\ncapacities for diachronic agency that play a central role in establishing what 's important for the person  where the person stands  are compromised . and\nin the context of such problems , the importance placed on patient autonomy in liberal societies would seem to give medical professionals a reason to do what they can to restore selfhood , perhaps even if this requires an infringement on personal liberty .\nthis might involve overriding a refusal of treatment , for example , though the justification for doing so would only warrant interventions of a particular kind \nthose that are likely to restore the general capacity that the principle of patient autonomy aims to protect .\nthis suggests that in some cases , especially in the context of mental illness , the importance placed on patient autonomy in contemporary medical ethics presents the law with a dilemma . on the one hand\n, it seems right that laws which license infringements on decision - making liberty should equally apply to everyone , not just to particular groups ; and that if a patient has mental capacity in relation to a particular treatment decision then they should be free to direct the course of their medical care .\nconsequently , it seems we ought to do away with dedicated mental health laws that legalise detention and involuntary treatment without reference to mental capacity only in the context of a mental disorder . on the other hand , the way in which diachronic agency is compromised in some instances  especially in the context of mental disorder\n seems to justify or perhaps even require an infringement on liberty to restore the self .\nthese grounds are difficult to take into consideration in assessments of mental capacity without compromising features of the mca that are designed to preserve patient autonomy .\nso while it might be possible to implement the mca in a way that sufficiently accounts for the problems of decision - making and selfhood that are sometimes present in mental disorders , doing so comes at the price of what is seen to be a central virtue of the legislation .\nin this article my focus was requirements of rationality derived from a diachronic perspective , and the question of what kinds of consideration this perspective would enable mental capacity assessments to include . it was an attempt to explore the limits of the mca 's incapacity test , given its value - neutral approach .\nit was argued that considerations derived from a diachronic perspective are relevant to questions of treatment decision - making liberty , and are consistent with a procedural understanding of the functional element of the test .\nhowever , in practice , appeal to these considerations in assessments of mental capacity undermines the role played by the functional element of the test in preserving patient autonomy . while involuntary treatment without reference to mental capacity is often assumed to undermine the principle of respecting patient autonomy , it was argued here that this is not necessarily so .\nwhen human agency is seriously compromised , preserving patient autonomy may sometimes require overriding a treatment decision to restore selfhood , on grounds that are not easily accounted for under the mca without compromising the value - neutral aspirations of this area of law .\nin considering a move to abandon dedicated mental health law , legislators must therefore resolve a bind .\nthe central motivation for such a move is concern about unjustified infringements on liberty in the context of psychiatric diagnoses .\nthe worry is that the protections of patient autonomy in the mca do not currently extend to the treatment of mental disorders , because mental health legislation allows people to be treated for a mental disorder even if they refuse with mental capacity .\nhowever , considerations derived from a diachronic perspective that seem relevant to when an infringement on decision - making liberty is justified are especially present in mental disorder .\nthe inclusion of these considerations seems necessary for adequately caring for those with a mental disorder under universal capacity legislation . yet including these factors in assessments of mental capacity undermines the protections of patient autonomy that supporters of a shift to universal capacity legislation hope to gain ."}
{"id": 116, "text": "type iii dysbetalipoproteinaemia is a kind of lipid metabolism disorders , caused by apo - e deficiency , which leads to accumulation of chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein remnants in the plasma.123 lipid metabolism disorders are mostly manifested by xanthomas , which are known as yellowish cholesterol - rich material in large foam cells accumulating in the skins and tendons.14 these yellowish lesions may appear all over the body , on the palm of the hands , sole of the foot , tendons , and even on the eyelids.5 these lesions firstly described with or without hyperlipidaemia in association with monoclonal immunoglobulin . based on this fact , there are three forms of xanthoma : hyperlipaemic xanthoma , normolipaemic xanthoma and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma.6 xanthomatosis is usually associated with hyperlipidaemia , and morbidity and mortality of this condition are related to atherosclerosis and pancreatitis.7 hyperlipaemic xanthoma lesions are more polymorphic and can include tuberous , tendinous , palmar or eruptive xanthoma .\nverruciform xanthoma usually presents as a hyperkeratotic , cauliflower like , verrucous or papillomatous lesion.6 it initially was described as a unique clinicopathologic lesion of the oral mucosa and was subsequently reported in the skin .\nthe epidermal - mucosal changes of hyperparakeratosis , neutrophilic infiltrate and dermal - submucosal foam cell reaction are distinctive features of these xanthomas.8 hereby , we present a rare type of xanthomas calling  cauliflower xanthoma  in a 43-year - old man with dysbetalipoproteinaemia .\na 43-year - old man was presented to outpatient endocrine clinic of tabriz university of medical sciences , tabriz , iran , by his sister for evaluation of skin lesions .\nhe had multiple lesions on shoulders and back , lateral and medial part of dorsal surface of the foot , medial and lateral malleus of both feet , and dorsal and palmar surface of both hands .\nsiblings of the patient have been followed up in that clinic for clinically diagnosed type - iii dysbetalipoproteinaemia .\nthis diagnosis was based on characteristic palmar , eruptive , tuberous and trauma site xanthomas with typical high levels of both total cholesterol and triglycerides in the plasma .\nhistory of coronary artery or other atherosclerotic disorders were negative in index case and siblings .\nthere were not any other complaint , and as a greengrocer , he had an active lifestyle .\nhe had a pathology report of skin lesion biopsy that was performed by a dermatologist few months ago , with presence of lipid laden macrophages consistent with diagnosis of xanthoma . fasting serum lipid levels reported as : total cholesterol = 507 mg / dl , triglycerides = 470 mg / dl and high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol = 41 mg / dl .\nhe had normal fasting blood sugar , and normal thyroid , renal and liver function tests .\nphysical examinations revealed numerous xanthomas resembling cauliflower on both knees [ figure 1 ] , unusual eruptive , tuberous xanthomas same as previous lesions , on the lateral malleus of both feet [ figure 2 ] .\ncauliflower xanthomas on the knees and lateral malleus of both lower extremities cauliflower xanthomas on the lateral malleus of lower extremities there were lots of smaller xanthomas on the right shoulder [ figure 3 ] , and cauliflower like xanthomas on the extensor side of the left upper extremity , especially on the elbow [ figure 4 ] . based on available information\n, the patient diagnosed as familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia ( fdl ) and the unique lesions on the lower limb called  cauliflower xanthoma  .\nalthough siblings of this case had the same disorder , they did nt develop such lesions .\nxanthomas on the shoulder and back of the neck xanthomas on the extensor side of the hand by searching in the medical data bases , we can not find a previous such a lesion . therefore , we decided to present this case without revealing patient 's name , after taking his consent .\nconsidering the fact that the treatment with high dose statin was effective in correction of lipid abnormality and regression of skin lesions in his three siblings , we wanted to try the treatment procedure in this patient but he refused any intervention .\nfdl , also known as hyperlipoproteinemia type - iii or broad beta disease , is a rare inherited disorder characterised by improper metabolism of certain lipids , specially plasma cholesterol , triglyceride rich chylomicron and very low density lipoproteins ( vldl ) remnants.1 presence or absence of the symptoms of this disease depends on two major risk factors : genetic and diet.910 mutations in the gene for apolipoprotein e ( apo e ) are the main cause of this disease .\nreplacement of an arginine by a cysteine in position 158 of the 299-amino acid chain of apo e5 is responsible for the defective binding of chylomicron and vldl remnants to cell receptors .\nthereafter , slower plasma clearance of these particles occurs , and results in the abnormal accumulation of lipids in the body.9 on the other side , diet has an essential role in the development of the disease .\nthis means that with standard cholesterol diet , symptoms of fdl will not appear , even in the genetically susceptible person.10 xanthomas can be a symptom of fdl .\nxanthomas may also be the symptoms of a generalised histiocytosis , or a local fat phagocytosing storage process.11 they are yellowish lesions on the skins and tendons , macroscopically .\nthese macrophages are filled with lipid droplets , which are dissolved and removed from tissue during histologic processing.8 fdl is mostly diagnosed by combination of clinical and laboratory findings.12 most cases are inherited as autosomal recessive trait .\nmen are more susceptible for fdl probably because of protective impact of estrogen in women .\nmost of the diagnosed patients were typically young males , with strong family history , characteristic skin lesions , high serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and confirming skin histology.113 most of these cases have premature atherosclerosis and other signs of ischaemic disorders.9 the patient in this article was a middle aged man with family history of dysbetalipoproteinaemia and high levels of serum lipids as follows : total cholesterol = 507 mg / dl and triglycerides = 470 mg / dl .\nhe had a rare form of xanthoma all over his body , causing social problems for him .\nnicotinic acid , clofibrate , statins or gemfibrozil properly reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in people affected with dysbetalipoproteinaemia.1 the patient mentioned in this article refused receiving any medical intervention .\nhe has just been advised to have low lipid diet , fish oil and regular moderate exercise in order to reducing serum lipid levels .\nthere should be distinctive monitoring of fdl patients including regular checking of their serum lipids .\ncontrolling underlying disorders , and reducing excess calories , saturated fat and cholesterol , is the main aim of treating these patients . according to this article\n, cauliflower xanthomas could be a symptom of fdl , and it should be considered as a differential diagnosis while approaching to these lesions ."}

exacerbator phenotype is important to consider in the management of copd patients , who require future exacerbation - related hospitalization associated with high mortality.16 a previous western study suggested that frequent exacerbators tend to have had exacerbations during the previous year , a lower fev1 , more severe hrqol , a history of gerd , and a higher peripheral white blood - cell count in comparison with infrequent exacerbators and nonexacerbators.12 another western study demonstrated that the characteristics of frequent exacerbators include a more severe mmrc - scale grade , lower fev1 predicted , comorbid cardiovascular disease , depression or osteoporosis , and female sex as independent risk factors.32,33 we conducted the present study to observe moderate and severe exacerbations 1 year before and after baseline to investigate the characteristics of japanese copd patients who were frequent exacerbators . based on exacerbations during the previous year , we found that frequent exacerbators were more likely to be female , have a lower body mass index , have a significantly lower fev1 predicted , have a higher mmrc - scale grade ( lower exercise tolerance ) , and have a lower total cat score ( lower hrqol ) .\nwe also found that the characteristics of frequent exacerbators were similar between japanese and westerners , except for body mass index , as reported previously.12,16,32 interestingly , univariate analysis did not show that previous frequent exacerbators would become future frequent exacerbators ( table 2 ) .\nindeed , 60% of previous frequent exacerbators did not suffer subsequent exacerbations , whereas conversely 14% of patients who had not previously suffered exacerbations subsequently did so ( figure 2 ) .\ninvestigation of factors predicting the change in frequency of exacerbations is critically important , as they are still unclear.34 a total of 78 ( 86.7% ) of our 90 patients completed the 1-year prospective study period . among five severe exacerbators , one ( 20% ) died , two ( 40% ) again developed severe exacerbation , and two ( 40% )\ntherefore , severe exacerbators appear to have a poor prognosis . however , our study - sample size was small and the observational period short .\nfrequent exacerbators had a significantly higher frequency of future exacerbations and a shorter period until the next exacerbation than nonexacerbators , and also had a significantly poorer prognosis than the latter , thus confirming the findings of a previous study.12 previous studies have demonstrated that over half of copd patients have unreported exacerbations .\nsuch unreported exacerbations are thought to be an important component of hrqol decline.7,35,36 in our present study , to make the conditions for previous and future exacerbations uniform , daily journals for symptoms were not accepted .\nprevious studies have demonstrated that the frequency of annual moderate or severe exacerbations per patient in japanese individuals may be lower than that in the usa and europe.13,14,3537 in our study , the mean (  sd [ range ] ) of previous annual total and severe exacerbations were 0.841.48 ( 06 ) and 0.060.23 ( 01 ) exacerbations / year , respectively for all patients ( data not shown ) , whereas those of future total and severe exacerbations were 0.711.08 ( 04 ) and 0.060.28 ( 02 ) exacerbations / year , respectively .\nour data for the frequency of exacerbations seem to indicate a slightly lower incidence in japanese than in westerners.1215,31,32,38 previous japanese reports on the frequency of exacerbations have been scarce.13,14 japanese copd patients may be slightly older and thinner on average than westerners.1215,31,32,38 although the discrepancy between japanese and westerners is still unclear , the difference in the frequency of exacerbations may be associated with different populations of phenotypes with emphysema , locality , and understanding of both the physician and the patient about diseases and exacerbations , such as convenient use of ics , and in definition of exacerbation .\npatients with copd have a wide variety of numerous comorbidities , which are strongly associated with mortality and exacerbation.1,12,26 we assessed baseline comorbidities based on interviews with patients and the physicians diagnosis , and partly through examinations or questionnaires .\nseveral comorbidities , such as depression21,39 assessed by the cesd questionnaire , acos27,40 based on previous criteria , and congestive status with heart failure and cor pulmonale based on history or medical signs,41 were carefully excluded .\ngerd , although not moderate to severe , was a common major comorbidity , and the proportion of frequent exacerbators with gerd was significantly higher than that of nonexacerbators .\ngerd was an independent , and the highest , risk factor for future frequent exacerbations , although all patients with gerd were receiving proton - pump inhibitors .\nour results confirmed previous reports.12,42 a low fev1 predicted was an independent risk factor for future exacerbations .\nthe guidelines1,43 recommend long - term treatment with ics and pneumococcal vaccination for patients with severe and very severe copd , and frequent exacerbations may not be adequately controlled by long - acting bronchodilators . in our study\nregular use of ics , but not pneumococcal vaccination , was an independent risk factor for future frequent exacerbations .\nsixteen ( 17.8% ) of our patients used ics , although none had received ics without long - acting bronchodilators at baseline .\nusers of ics included four nonexacerbators with gold stage ii , seven patients with frequent exacerbations , and the remaining five had severe or very severe disease .\nthe risk of ics for respiratory infection including pneumonia is a concern.4446 among four nonexacerbators with gold stage ii and users of ics during the prospective observation period , two patients had frequent exacerbations and one had infrequent exacerbations .\nthis risk must be weighed against the benefits when prescribing ics to patients with copd .\nfirst , the study population was small and the observation period rather short for analyzing severe exacerbations and mortality .\nbalcells et al demonstrated that female sex was the highest risk factor for exacerbation,33 although in the present study there was no difference in the frequency of exacerbations between males and females .\nboth physicians and patients were aware of the severity and frequency of previous exacerbations at baseline .\nwe carefully removed severe comorbidities , such as cardiovascular disease and depression , in accordance with previous reports.26,27 however , patients with asthma and acos may have been included , because we did not investigate airway responsiveness and inflammation or serum total immunoglobulin ( ig ) e levels , although we carefully excluded patients with asthma based on symptoms and spirometry\n. however , no patients had received medications for osteoporosis and low peripheral lymphocyte counts , although latent osteoporosis and hiv infections were not tested for .\nfourth , the contents of medicines could not be ethically unified in a clinical setting in japan , and in our study adherence to pharmacological medicines and compliance with inhalation techniques were not assessed or included .\nthe effects of respiratory medications , including inhaled medicines , on previous and future exacerbations were investigated .\nthe presence of gerd , regular use of ics , and low fev1 may be associated with frequent exacerbations ."}

{"id": 119, "text": "the national cancer institute ( nci ) of the united states of america has proposed a reporting system for thyroid fine needle aspiration ( fna ) cytology , so - called bethesda system , which became an international standard of thyroid cytology [ 1 , 2 ] . following this recommendation , the uk royal college of pathologists ( the uk system ) [ 3 , 4 ] and italian societies of endocrinology and the italian society for anatomic pathology and cytology joint with the italian division of the international academy of pathology ( the italian system ) [ 5 , 6 ] updated their diagnostic schema comparable with the bethesda system . in 2013 ,\nthe japan thyroid association ( jta ) published guidelines for clinical practice for the management of thyroid nodules , including its diagnostic system for reporting thyroid fna cytology as shown in table 1 [ 79 ] , using criteria similar to those used in the papanicolaou society recommendation , the bethesda system [ 1 , 2 ] , the uk system [ 3 , 4 ] , and the italian system [ 5 , 6 ] .\nthe jta reporting system of thyroid cytology further recommends risk stratification of follicular neoplasms ( fn ) into favor benign ( low risk : lr ) , borderline ( moderate risk : mr ) , and favor malignant ( high risk : hr ) , which was adopted from the practice of high - volume thyroid centers in japan .\nthis study examined observer variation in the subclassification of fn among 4 thyroid experts to validate the usefulness and limitations of this characteristic risk stratification of fn recommended in the jta guidelines .\nit is not our purpose to address in detail all the morphological issues of thyroid cytology .\nconventional smear samples of indeterminate diagnosis ( n = 389 ) were selected from files ( n = 3843 ) from the year 2005 at ito hospital , tokyo , japan , by one ( k. kameyama ) of the authors .\ninadequate samples or those with poor preparation and cases under clinical follow - up ( no final histologic diagnosis ) were excluded .\nthere were 91 ( 23.4% ) surgically treated patients with thyroid nodule under indeterminate cytological diagnoses .\nthese patients visited ito hospital in 2005 and underwent diagnostic surgery or curative surgery in the subsequent years between 2005 and 2008 .\nthere were 48 cases of benign diagnoses , including 29 follicular adenomas ( fas ) , 19 adenomatous nodules ( an ) , and 43 malignant diagnoses , including 13 follicular carcinomas ( ftcs ) , 24 papillary carcinomas ( ptcs ) , 1 poorly differentiated carcinoma , 2 c - cell carcinomas , and 3 malignant lymphomas .\ntwenty cases of cytological smear samples with follicular patterned lesions were randomly selected by one ( k. kameyama ) of the authors and they were further analyzed for subclassification of fn and diagnoses by 4 reviewers , as shown in table 2 .\nthe present study is a reproducibility study undertaken by 4 reviewers ( kennichi kakudo , kaori kameyama , mitsuyoshi hirokawa , and ryohei katoh ) who have special interest in thyroid pathology , all of whom are members of the clinical guideline committee of the jta .\nthey were requested to subclassify fn following the new jta reporting system of thyroid cytology as shown in table 1 .\nthose 20 cases of smear samples ( one representative smear sample each stained by the papanicolaou method ) were circulated among the 4 reviewers without clinical information .\nthe 4 reviewers examined cytological samples independently without exchanging opinions and were unaware of the original cytological diagnoses and final histologic diagnoses . because this study was conceived as an audit of cytology performance and the results are anonymized , institutional ethical committee permission was not required for its conduct .\ninformed consent of all 4 reviewers was obtained for this study protocol . for statistical analysis of observer concordance ,  was first introduced as a measure of the level of agreement between pairs of raters and extended to multiple raters , known as composite  [ 11 , 12 ] .\ncomposite  statistical analysis was performed by using data analysis and statistical software , version 13 ( stata press , college station , texas , usa ) .\nvalues of  can be interpreted as follows : 0.000.20 , slight or very weak agreement ; 0.210.40 , weak to fair agreement ; 0.410.60 , moderate agreement ; 0.610.80 , substantial or good agreement ; and values over 0.81 , optimal or almost perfect agreement .\nthere were 8 malignant cases ( 2 ftcs , widely invasive ; 4 ftcs , minimally invasive ; and 2 ptcs ) and 12 benign cases ( 1 an and 11 fas ) .\nall diagnoses made by the 4 reviewers on the 20 follicular pattern lesions are shown in table 2 .\nthere were only 6 ( 30% ) cases with a consensus diagnosis among all 4 of the reviewers : 3 in fa and 3 in ftc .\ndiagnoses of fn and hr were made in only 7 cases ( 35% ) , including 4 malignant and 3 benign cases .\ncomposite  statistical analysis clearly demonstrated good concordance for the hr diagnosis in malignant cases (  = 0.7714 ) ( table 3 ) , while this was not found for the other subcategories in both benign and malignant lesions (  < 0.4 ) .\nit is of note that there was no interobserver variation in ftcs , widely invasive ( n = 2 ) , and all 4 reviewers classified the 2 cases into the hr subcategory .\nit is clear that ftcs , widely invasive , have different degrees of cellular abnormality in our study .\nin contrast , there were significant disagreements among other types of malignancy and benign lesions , which clearly confirmed that the subclassification of fn is not a definite diagnosis but risk stratification useful for triage patients .\nconcerning ftc , minimally invasive ( n = 4 ) , there was only one concordant case among the 4 reviewers and all reviewers made a mr diagnosis in 1 case .\nthere were disagreements between mr and hr in 1 case and between lr and mr in 2 cases .\nas for ptc ( n = 2 ) , the 4 reviewers gave 2 diagnoses each , which included 3 lrs , 3 mrs , 1 hr , and 1 suspicious for ptc .\nhowever , it is of note that there was no single case in our 20 cases whose subclassification varied among all 3 subcategories . in benign final histologic diagnosis ( n = 12 ) , there were 9 split diagnoses , including 6 cases between lr and mr and 3 cases between mr and hr , but no case between lr and hr .\nthe incidence of lr diagnoses by the 4 reviewers in the 12 benign lesions was 31.3% ( 15/48 ) and that of lr diagnoses in the 6 cases of ftc was 16.7% ( 4/24 ) ( p = 0.186 ) .\nthe incidence of hr diagnosis in the 12 benign lesions was 10.4% ( 5/48 ) and that of hr in the 6 cases of ftc was 47.1% ( 10/24 ) ( p = 0.002 ) .\nthe incidence of malignancy of the hr was high at 60% for reviewer a , 75% for b , 75% for c , and 75% for d ( 6075% ) .\nthe incidence of malignancy in the mr was lower than that of hr and was 33.3% for reviewer a , 35.7% for reviewer b , 25% for c , and 30.8% for d ( 2535.7% ) .\nthe incidence of malignancy in the lr was lower than that in the hr and was 33.3% for reviewer a , 0% for b , 37.5% for c , and 33.3% for d ( 037.5% ) .\nalthough the risks of malignancy in the subcategories of fn differed among the 4 reviewers , it is of note that hr cytological diagnosis was significantly correlated with malignant histological diagnosis , and the risk of malignancy ( 6075% ) was significantly higher than that in the other 2 subcategories ( 035.7% ) in our study ( p = 0.002 ) .\nalthough the standardization of terminology and diagnostic criteria is important for accurate communication among patients , clinical doctors , and cytopathologists [ 110 ] , there are still differences among reporting systems in thyroid cytology as to how to interpret cytological diagnoses and how to decide on the clinical management of patients . in japan , cytopathologists attempted to use an internationally accepted reporting system , but it had to be modified to fit our practice . in japan , all patients with indeterminate cytology undergo further diagnostic procedures , without immediate surgery , to search for higher risk patients who should undergo surgery [ 79 , 1315 ] .\nit is because the majority of thyroid carcinomas in indeterminate cytology are indolent and more conservative approaches , other than immediate diagnostic surgery , usually do not create any harm to the patient with malignancy [ 1620 ] and diagnostic surgery to all patients with indeterminate cytology results in risks of unnecessary surgery to the patients with benign nodules , more than 80% of the patients [ 79 , 1922 ] .\nthe proportion of malignancy found at thyroidectomy from patients with indeterminate cytology in this clinical setting will increase in number , and the malignancy rate of patient with indeterminate cytology in our study was calculated as 47.3% as shown in materials and methods .\ntakezawa et al . from japan retrospectively analyzed their 1606 cytological samples using bethesda system , although it was written in japanese with english abstract , and they identified 115 ( 7.9% ) cases of aus / flus ( atypia of undetermined significance / follicular lesions of undetermined significance ) and 61 ( 4.2% ) cases of fn / sfn ( follicular neoplasms / suspicious for follicular neoplasms ) .\nthe resection rate of their aus / flus nodules was 30.4% ( 35/115 cases ) and its malignancy rate was 88.6% ( 31/35 cases ) , and the resection rate of fn / sfn nodules was 36.0% ( 22/61 cases ) and its malignancy rate was 72.4% ( 16/22 cases ) , which were very different from the ranges reported in most of the literatures from western countries using the bethesda system or the uk system [ 1 , 2 , 2023 ] . as it is clear , further triage of patients with indeterminate nodules reduces resection rates and increases malignancy rates in any diagnostic systems including the bethesda system .\nthis clinical management was also true in some other countries [ 2427 ] , as crippa and dina commented in a letter to an editor that thyroid cytology is the most important but not the only important deciding factor and therefore it must be integrated with other diagnostic procedures .\nwe propose that future thyroid cytology classification schemes should reconsider clinical managements of indeterminate categories and how to reduce unnecessary surgeries for patients with benign thyroid nodules [ 79 ] .\nthe risk stratification of follicular pattern lesions into 3 subcategories ( cellular follicular lesion , fn favor benign , and fn favor malignant ) was suggested by the papanicolaou society in 1996 , but it did not become popular in thyroid cytology worldwide , apart from japan [ 8 , 9 ] . there have been some reports in the literature on risk stratification of fn [ 10 , 2834 ] .\nkelman et al . reported that 31/52 ( 60% ) nodules with nuclear atypia consistent with fn were malignant   and it was 4/9 ( 44.4% ) in fn with atypia by goldstein et al . .\nreported that atypical proliferation was more often malignant than follicular group ( 53% versus 19% ) in their indeterminate category ( tir3/thy3 ) .\nsome researchers pointed out that the malignancy rate of fn without atypia is low and assessment later on could be an alternative approach [ 31 , 32 ] and patients with high - risk cytological features such as nuclear overlapping ( crowding ) should be advised to have a surgical intervention [ 3133 ] .\ngerhard and da cunha santos using the papanicolaou society guidelines studied reproducibility between 2 observers in 97 diagnoses .\nthey reported a substantial level of diagnostic interobserver (  = 0.71 ) and intraobserver (  = 0.66 ) reproducibility , although interobserver disagreement in the cytological diagnosis occurred in 23 cases ( 24.7% ) and 18 ( 41.7% ) of them were for fn .\nin an interobserver reproducibility study using the uk system , kocjan et al . reported that the  statistic was very poor ( 0.11 ) for the thy3a category and that for thy4 was 0.17 , in contrast to moderate to good agreement for thy1 ( 0.69 ) , thy2 ( 0.55 ) , thy3f ( 0.51 ) , and thy5 ( 0.61 ) .\nthe observer variation of fn in our study occurred more often between lr and mr ( 9 cases , 45% ) , followed by between mr and hr ( 5 cases , 25% ) , but it is remarkable to note that none occurred between lr and hr . in other words , discordance is limited to between lr and mr or mr and hr , so we may conclude that the mr subcategory has an essential role in minimizing discordance between lr and hr .\nanother choice of subclassification of follicular neoplasms would be two categories ( low cancer risk and high cancer risk )   instead of three categories ( lr , mr , and hr ) , and this modification ( two categories ) is also described as acceptable in the reporting system recommended by the japan thyroid association [ 7 , 8 ] .\nthe second conclusion we may draw is that hr in the jta system is a powerful cytological subcategory to be used for the triage of patients for diagnostic surgery because the risk of malignancy of hr is high ( 6075% ) equivalent to suspicious for malignancy category in the bethesda system , with good concordance among the 4 reviewers (  = 0.7714 ) .\nabele and levine reported their rate of indeterminate category to be 5% of 51,000 adequate fnas and they suggested that the national rate of 15% was in large part due to overdiagnosis . this significant difference in ratio of indeterminate categories may be due to experience of thyroid cytology and not patients ' background .\nclary et al . commented in their interobserver variability study that some pathologists make greater use of indeterminate categories such as follicular lesion , favor nonneoplastic or follicular lesion , and favor neoplastic lesion , whereas others show more definitive categorization into benign and neoplastic groups .\ncibas et al . also stated in their report on interobserver variability that cytopathologists with experience of thyroid cytopathology are more likely to make a definitive interpretation ( i.e. , benign or malignant ) .\nthis tendency was seen in our present study in which reviewers b and d ( whose indeterminate diagnosis rates are about 15% in their practice ) made mr diagnosis more often ( 70% and 65% , resp . ) and lr diagnosis less frequently ( 10% and 15% , resp . ) than those of reviewers a and c ( whose indeterminate diagnosis rates are about 5% in their practice ) .\nthe difference in the prevalence of benign and fn / sfn may explain the different rates of lr ( low risk ) and mr ( moderate risk ) among reviews in our study , because incidence of one category may expand or contract depending on the rates of other categories .\nsome fn / sfn lesions with benign pattern would be classified as benign by different authors and the incidence of fn / sfn of bethesda system in recent 7 series varied from 1.5 to 9.7% and that of benign category was between 54 and 77.4% summarized by ohori and schoedel .\nrapid development of molecular analyses on thyroid cytology may lead us possibly in the near future to more accurately identify patients who should be referred to surgery . until that time comes\n, thyroid fna cytology remains a main stay in the management of patients with thyroid nodules integrated with other clinical tests , such as ultrasound image diagnosis . as a conclusion\nthe hr subcategory has a high predictive value of malignancy and good agreement among the 4 reviewers which is clinically helpful to triage patients for surgery .\nwe believe that patients with cytological diagnosis of hr subcategory of fn in the jta system should be surgically treated especially if other risk factors coexisted . on the other hand , patients with lr or mr category\ntherefore , surgical resection rate of indeterminate category is low in japan usually less than 50% , particularly in cases with fn ."}

ordered to monitor anticoagulant therapy ( pt / inr for warfarin , aptt for heparin ) , to evaluate coagulation preoperatively , or in response to hemorrhagic symptoms .\nthe pt / inr provides an assessment of the extrinsic ( tissue factor - dependent ) and final common pathways of the coagulation cascade , while the aptt provides an assessment of the intrinsic ( tissue factor - independent ) and final common pathways.10 an example of a potentially life - threatening cause of unexplained recent onset or acute bleeding associated with a prolonged aptt is acquired hemophilia , with an incidence of approximately 1 to 4 per million / year.11 acquired hemophilia primarily affects older adults,12 an ever - growing segment of the population that presents for medical evaluation and care , but may also occur during pregnancy as postpartum hemorrhage or in association with other underlying diseases , including cancer and autoimmune disorders.13 prompt diagnosis is a primary determinant of prognosis in acquired hemophilia14 because initiation of definitive therapy ( ie , hemostatic and immunosuppressive ) is delayed until the diagnosis is made .\nacquired hemophilia - related bleeding does not respond to the typical management algorithms used for hemorrhaging in a patient and , therefore , is associated with high morbidity and mortality .\nsevere bleeds occur in up to 90% of patients with acquired hemophilia,11 and the reported overall mortality rate in these patients ranges from 8% to 22%.1517 given the rarity of acquired hemophilia , combined with the general lack of familiarity of nonhematologists with this condition , the diagnosis of acquired hemophilia poses a clinical challenge , even in patients presenting with straightforward bleeding and an isolated , prolonged aptt .\na survey was conducted of physicians across a number of specialties to identify potential barriers to the effective recognition and management of this rare but important cause of serious bleeding .\nthe survey , based on an actual case found to be the result of acquired hemophilia , focused on participants stepwise evaluation and management of a case patient who presented to the hospital with recent - onset bleeding .\nthe survey also assessed participants history with regard to consulting hematologists , discovering or diagnosing underlying bleeding disorders , and encountering acquired hemophilia in clinical practice .\nfindings pertaining to the interpretation and follow - up of abnormal coagulation studies , enlistment of hematology consultation , and the diagnostic decision process in an actively bleeding case patient were the primary areas assessed in this analysis .\nresults were evaluated across specialties to determine any specialty - specific practice trends that might hinder effective recognition and management of an actively bleeding patient with coagulopathy , including acquired hemophilia .\nphysicians within the specialties of hematology , hematology / oncology , emergency medicine , geriatrics , internal medicine , rheumatology , obstetrics and gynecology , critical care medicine , and general surgery were randomly sampled from the american medical association physician masterfile .\nphysicians who were part of the harris interactive online physician panel were invited via email to participate in the survey , while physicians who were not part of the panel were invited via first class mail .\nthe invitation provided a uniform resource locator address and password for one - time use to log on to the survey site , where invitees first encountered questions to determine eligibility to participate in the survey .\neligible physicians were required to be actively practicing , with additional specialty - specific requirements .\nin particular , hematologists , hematologist / oncologists , general surgeons , and emergency medicine and critical care physicians were required to be practicing at an acute care hospital . for internists and geriatricians ,\nat least 60% of their practice had to consist of patients older than 60 years of age .\nobstetricians / gynecologists were required to have an active obstetrics practice . upon confirmation of eligibility , participants completed the online survey , the average duration of which was approximately 10 minutes .\neach specialty was recruited to a final sample of 50 complete responses to ensure a sufficient number of responses to generate reasonable hypotheses about specialists behavior to test in face - to - face interviews .\nfindings from the surveys completed by the physicians specializing in hematology , hematology / oncology , emergency medicine , geriatrics , internal medicine , rheumatology , and critical care medicine are presented herein .\ngeneral surgeons and obstetrics and gynecology physicians each completed different surveys from the aforementioned specialties ; the findings of those surveys are not included here .\nsurvey questions focused on the diagnostic and general therapeutic approach to the management of a case patient ( figure 1 ) whose presentation and clinical course were based on those of a real patient who experienced significant delays in diagnosis despite the involvement of multiple specialists . at each juncture in the case , participants were given lists of actions that included diagnostic tests ( laboratory , radiology , other ) , consultations , and potential treatments addressing bleeding or anemia ( local hemostasis , transfusion ) . since familiarity with the upper limits of normal of the pt / aptt tests was being tested in this study , upper limits of normal were not specified , and aptts were 25% to 30% above the upper limits of normal and set at a value that respective specialties would recognize as abnormal based on their experience with ordering and interpreting this laboratory test .\nthe survey did not specify whether laboratory testing , imaging studies , or consultations in this hypothetical case had to be available immediately or locally , and the assumption was that respondents would answer based on their best medical judgment in an ideal practice situation .\nrheumatologists were only asked about an initial emergency department / urgent care presentation because it was expected that if a bleeding disorder developed in one of their patients it would present in an outpatient or emergency department / urgent care setting .\nconversely , critical care specialists started at presentation 2 , since their involvement in a recurrent epistaxis workup would be unlikely .\nvital signs were adjusted to make it more likely that a potential intensive care unit admission would require their evaluation . since emergency medicine physicians would most likely have ordered an imaging study initially to define the patient s retroperitoneal hematoma , we allowed for the option of a general surgery consultation even though the computed tomography findings were never presented .\nhematology / oncology respondents were given the option of ordering additional specialty coagulation laboratory tests ( eg , mixing studies ) . participants were additionally questioned about their experiences diagnosing underlying bleeding disorders and , in the case of nonhematologist specialists , consulting hematologist colleagues .\nconversely , hematology and hematology / oncology specialists were asked about being on the receiving end of consultations , specifically from emergency medicine personnel , and the reasons for those consultations .\na total of 302 physicians ( 5051 per specialty ) participated in the case - based survey reported herein .\ndemographics of the specialty groups were consistent : mean age ranged from 45.6 to 50.6 years , and mean years of practice experience ranged from 14.5 to 19.3 .\nfaced with an older adult female patient with recurrent epistaxis , nearly 90% of physicians in each of the surveyed specialties indicated they would have ordered a complete blood count and coagulation studies ( pt / inr and aptt ) as part of the initial evaluation ( figure 2a ) . despite abnormal results of the aptt at 42 seconds ( with an upper limit of normal typically ranging from 35 to 39 seconds , although not specified in the case ) , less than half the physicians in most specialties would have chosen to repeat the coagulation studies as one of the next steps ( figure 2b ) . in contrast , 67% of hematologists would have repeated these studies . less than 45% of surveyed physicians in all nonhematology specialties would have consulted a hematologist after reviewing the initial coagulation study results ( figure 2b ) .\nrheumatologists were most likely to obtain a consult ( 43% ) , although they were presented with an initial aptt that was more abnormal ( 50 seconds ) than the aptt initially presented to the other specialists .\nafter the patient s second presentation several weeks later with bruising and abdominal / back pain , again nearly 90% or more of respondents ( including critical care specialists , who began their case review at this juncture in the patient s clinical course ) would have ordered both a complete blood and coagulation studies as part of their initial evaluation ( figure 2c ) .\nwhen these results revealed a clearly abnormal and markedly changed aptt of 63 seconds , the majority of respondents indicated they still would not have repeated coagulation studies ( figure 2d ) .\napproximately 75% of internal medicine and geriatrics physicians would have consulted a hematologist at this point , compared with 47% and 50% of emergency medicine and critical care specialists , respectively ( figure 2d ) .\nsixty percent of hematologists and hematologists / oncologists surveyed would have evaluated the patient s peripheral blood smear at this point .\nin addition to the aforementioned hematologic laboratory tests , other diagnostic tests and consultations that participants would have recommended from a series of options as part of their evaluation after the patient s second presentation are shown in figure 3 .\nparticipants across specialties clearly preferred computed tomography of the abdomen ( 80%84% ) over abdominal ultrasound ( 9%28% ) , upper gastrointestinal endoscopy ( 2%16% ) , or colonoscopy ( 0%16% ) .\nemergency medicine physicians demonstrated the greatest breadth of testing , with 82% additionally recommending urinalysis and 92% recommending a stool guaiac test .\nrequests for gastroenterology consultations ranged from 10% to 43% and were highest for the internal medicine group , which also had the highest proportion of physicians recommending endoscopy ( 16% each for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy ) . for the purposes of assessing multiple specialties , the next 12 hours of observation in the case patient s clinical course were described as having occurred in the emergency department . by the end of this observation period ,\nthe aptt had further increased to at least twice the upper limit of normal , while the hemoglobin level had decreased .\ninternists and geriatricians were most inclined to repeat the laboratory studies at this juncture ( figure 4 ) .\nin contrast with previous time points , by this point in the patient s clinical presentation , 73% to 94% of respondents would have consulted a hematologist .\nthe majority of hematologists would have ordered 1:1 mixing studies of patient and normal plasma to rule out coagulation inhibitors ( 97% ) and fibrinogen / fibrin split products testing ( 75% ) in response to the laboratory results obtained after 12 hours of observation , as part of a diagnostic evaluation of the prolonged aptt .\nemergency medicine physicians were given the additional option of consulting general surgery practitioners ; 2% would have done so after the first set of laboratory results at the second presentation , and 20% would have done so in response to the second set of laboratory results . the percentages of physicians in each specialty who would have recommended admission of this case patient to a general hospital floor or back to a skilled nursing facility or nursing home after initial presentation with subsequent abnormal aptt of 42 seconds are shown in figure 5a .\nacross the majority of specialties , less than 20% of physicians would have recommended overnight admission to a general hospital floor , while more than 50% of physicians in these specialties would have recommended discharge to a skilled nursing facility or a nursing home .\nin contrast with respondents from other specialties , a slightly higher proportion of hematologists and hematologist / oncologists would have endorsed a higher level of care at this point ; 36% of physicians in this group indicated they would have favored overnight hospital admission over discharge to a skilled nursing facility .\nthe majority of physicians faced with the second presentation would have recommended that the patient be admitted to the hospital .\nthe differences among specialties were most noticeable in allocation to a general hospital floor versus an intensive care unit after review of initial laboratory results or the second set of laboratory results obtained after 12 hours of observation ( figure 5b ) . while approximately 80% or more of physicians in each specialty would have recommended hospital admission in response to both sets of laboratory results , the proportion recommending admission specifically to the intensive care unit increased as the laboratory values deteriorated ( worsening anemia and coagulopathy ) . based on the laboratory results obtained after 12 hours of observation ,\nnearly 50% or more of physicians in each specialty would have recommended admission to the intensive care unit in lieu of a general hospital floor , compared with approximately 40% or less across specialties after the initial laboratory results obtained during the patient s second presentation .\nthe difference was most noticeable for physicians in emergency medicine ( 35%73% ) , the specialty most likely to refer the patient to an inpatient medical / hospitalist or critical care service .\nmore than 85% of emergency medicine and critical care physicians reported having ever discovered an underlying bleeding disorder , while 100% of hematologists and hematologist / oncologists reported having ever diagnosed one ( figure 6a ) .\nthe percentage of physicians in other specialties who had ever discovered an underlying bleeding diathesis ranged from 47% to 65% . among those physicians who had previously diagnosed or discovered a bleeding disorder , 14% to 77%

by their colleagues in emergency medicine .\nthe majority of these consults pertained to significantly abnormal coagulation studies with or without clinical bleeding ( table 2 ) .\nbleeding is commonly encountered in outpatient and hospital - based medical practice and can have a wide variety of underlying causes .\nwhile bleeding may be relatively common , most acquired and congenital bleeding disorders are uncommon , and some , such as acquired hemophilia , are rare . nevertheless , the consequences of failure to recognize promptly and treat properly a bleeding disorder may be significant.18 in the case of acquired hemophilia , morbidity and mortality rates are particularly high : severe bleeding is experienced by up to 90% of affected patients , and mortality rates\nare as high as 22%.11 this survey provided a step - wise methodology to tease out specialty - specific patterns of interpretation of clinical data to identify barriers to the diagnosis and treatment of underlying bleeding disorders .\nthe sample size obtained across specialties was sufficient to generalize these findings , at least to the point of identifying specific issues for education and development of clinical decision - making pathways .\nwhen presented with a clinical picture that includes a recent history or symptoms of active bleeding , clinicians typically obtain coagulation times , such as the pt / inr and aptt , as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation .\nproper interpretation of laboratory test results includes recognition of abnormal values and , more important , the potential clinical significance of such results . a common pitfall in the interpretation of coagulation times is failure to appreciate that even mildly abnormal values may represent a serious underlying coagulation deficit .\nanother important observation is to identify how an abnormal laboratory value may have changed over time , which can be facilitated by the ability of electronic medical record systems to display data trends . in the absence of iatrogenic causes , even a mildly elevated pt / inr or aptt may be indicative of true coagulopathy and should not be ignored or dismissed , particularly when there is evidence of bleeding , as was the case with this patient , even at initial presentation . after excluding laboratory error ,\nthe differential diagnosis of an isolated prolongation of aptt includes heparin effect , lupus anticoagulant , and deficiency of or antibody against an intrinsic pathway factor ( viii , ix , xi , or xii).19,20 a detailed history , focusing on factors such as heparin exposure,19,20 history of thromboembolism ( lupus anticoagulant),21 and prior personal or family history of bleeding,22 may provide diagnostic clues .\nlaboratory testing should include a 1:1 mixing test of patient plasma with control plasma to determine whether a prolonged aptt is the result of an intrinsic pathway factor deficiency or an inhibitor that continues to block the activity of the intrinsic system even in the presence of control plasma .\nthe majority of inhibitor antibodies identified in this manner will turn out to be lupus anticoagulants .\nalthough far less common , this is the same diagnostic pathway that leads to the identification of the antifactor viii antibodies associated with acquired hemophilia.23 unlike acquired hemophilia , lupus anticoagulants typically do not present with bleeding , and the abnormal aptt is due to interference with phospholipid - dependent coagulation reactions .\nonce an acquired antifactor viii antibody is suspected , confirmatory testing includes measuring factor viii activity , which should be significantly reduced , and the bethesda assay,24 which is used to quantitate antifactor viii antibodies inhibitor activity .\nwe found a general lack of appropriate consideration and response to the presenting symptom of bleeding and the prolonged aptt throughout this case study .\nthis is consistent with data from the european acquired haemophilia registry ( each-2 ) , which reported a median delay of 3 days between onset of bleeding symptoms and the diagnosis of acquired hemophilia and a median delay of one day between the first abnormal aptt test in those same patients and the established diagnosis.23 in addition , we found that emergency medicine and critical care physicians were reluctant to consider a bleeding disorder as the primary explanation for this patient s clinical presentation .\nthe disposition of a patient with active hemorrhage and evidence of coagulopathy should be based on several factors , including the patient s current condition and anticipated clinical course , taking into account the presenting vital signs and evolving laboratory findings . at the time of the patient\ns second presentation , vital signs were notable for mild tachycardia and a pulse pressure at the upper limit of normal , and subsequent laboratory findings indicated a decreasing hemoglobin level and an increasing aptt .\nthese findings alone prompted hospital admission , although the exact location ( general floor versus intensive care unit ) of admission may vary , based on the level of monitoring and nurse - to - patient ratios in a particular hospital .\nanother important variable is the anticipated potential for clinical deterioration , which is based in large part on clinician appreciation of the seriousness of the diagnosis .\nwe found a consistent tendency to consider admission to a general floor bed with the second presentation , even though this was ultimately an unstable , critically ill patient with an undiagnosed bleeding disorder .\nwe also found that the physicians who participated in this survey were reluctant to consult a hematologist as they worked through this case scenario , particularly given that options for additional testing ( liver function , disseminated intravascular coagulation ) were not available to evaluate for common causes of coagulopathy .\nrelative to their reported historical experience with hematology consultations during an average practice experience of approximately 20 years , this survey finding was somewhat surprising .\nrheumatologists and critical care specialists reported a greater frequency of hematology consultation relative to the other specialties ( table 2 ) .\nwe would expect the emergency medicine physicians to be most likely to consult a hematologist , yet 16% of them reported never having consulted a hematologist .\nthe highest percentage ( 46% ) had only consulted a hematologist 1 or 2 times , and almost one quarter of geriatricians and internists had never consulted a hematologist , even though these specialists would be expected to first encounter patients with undiagnosed bleeding disorders , including acquired hemophilia .\none potential reason for not seeking hematology consultation might be the lack of availability of hematology / oncology specialists with expertise in coagulation disorders , including in rural and community hospitals .\na limitation of this survey was that one can not interpret the thinking behind the responses of the individual participants .\ntherefore , 31 qualitative 45-minute interviews were conducted subsequent to the quantitative study and focused particularly on critical care ( n = 7 ) , emergency medicine ( n = 6 ) , hematology / oncology ( n = 4 ) , or hematology ( n = 2 ) physicians to understand the reasoning behind their decisions and depth of knowledge ( unpublished data ) . we found that the physicians focus was generally on finding the source ( location ) of bleeding and not on finding the underlying reason for bleeding .\nthis could potentially lead to surgical intervention in the face of an underlying bleeding disorder , with subsequent adverse outcomes . in a series of 67 patients with acquired hemophilia at a single center in bonn , germany ,\n4 of 5 deaths were the result of surgical intervention for bleeding at outside hospitals in the setting of a delayed diagnosis of acquired hemophilia.13 when queried about their experience encountering and/or diagnosing underlying bleeding disorders , particularly acquired hemophilia , more than 85% of physicians in hematology , hematology / oncology , emergency medicine , and critical care medicine reported having ever discovered or diagnosed an underlying bleeding disorder , compared with 65% , 54% , and 47% of rheumatologists , internists , and geriatricians , respectively . while reports of ever specifically having encountered acquired hemophilia were high , it is unclear from this study whether the participants truly understood the diagnosis .\nthis seems unlikely , given the rarity of acquired hemophilia , relative to the reported frequency of having encountered it .\nexcept for hematology and/or oncology ( 77% ) and critical care ( 36% ) specialists , approximately one quarter of surveyed physicians had ever encountered acquired hemophilia .\nalthough they accounted for the highest percentage of physicians who had ever encountered this condition , nearly one quarter of hematologists had never encountered acquired hemophilia .\nsubsequent unpublished data from the aforementioned qualitative research further suggest that , compared with hematology practitioners , specialists in hematology / oncology , who likely practice mostly oncology , might be able to identify  mixing studies  and  inhibitors  but might not fully understand the underlying pathophysiology that constitutes acquired hemophilia , making it hard for them to recognize the condition .\ngiven the survey findings reflecting the infrequency with which most physicians have encountered these conditions , consultation with a hematologist may facilitate the diagnostic evaluation and proper management of a hemorrhaging patient suspected of having an underlying bleeding diathesis , particularly acquired hemophilia .\nthe consulting hematologist can provide specific guidance , leading to the prompt diagnosis and optimal management of an actively bleeding patient with acquired hemophilia , including initiation of immunosuppression , which is usually necessary to eradicate the inhibitor and to prevent additional bleeding episodes .\nhowever , this requires a level of familiarity and expertise in treating acquired hemophilia and other rare bleeding disorders that is not often seen outside of an academic hematology practice .\nthis represents yet another barrier to the effective diagnosis and management of this rare yet serious bleeding diathesis .\nfor the hospitalist or intensivist charged with the care of a bleeding patient , immediate stabilization is the initial priority and should take precedence over determination of a specific etiology of bleeding .\nhowever , in the presence of underlying coagulopathy , particularly acquired hemophilia or other rare disorders , traditional measures of stabilization may not be as effective as expected .\na prolonged pt / inr or aptt in the absence of iatrogenic causes should never be ignored , even with only minimally prolonged values , and determination of the cause of an abnormal coagulation study should carry at least equal weight to looking for the anatomic site of bleeding . any delay in establishing the diagnosis of a bleeding diathesis such as acquired hemophilia can result in significant morbidity or even death .\nwhile hospitalists and intensivists should be able to conduct a thorough differential of bleeding and eliminate most common etiologies , consultation with a hematologist ( particularly one with specific expertise in coagulation disorders ) may facilitate the evaluation of coagulopathic patients and subsequent interpretation of diagnostic findings , as well as initiation of appropriate treatment . given the rarity of acquired hemophilia , as exemplified by the findings of this survey\n, physicians must harbor a high index of suspicion to diagnose this condition promptly in patients who present with recent - onset or acute bleeding . given the high morbidity and mortality\nthe insights from this survey highlights knowledge and practice gaps that could be the focus of targeted educational initiatives , including diagnostic algorithms , to ensure proper and efficient workup

hematy et al . , 2009 ; ringli , 2010 ; seifert and blaukopf , 2010 ) .\na recently published review focuses on cwi maintenance during plant cell wall morphogenesis ( wolf et al . , 2011 ) .\nsimilarities between the yeast and plant cwi maintenance mechanisms have also been reviewed ( hamann and denness , 2011 ) .\ntherefore , the available knowledge regarding cwi maintenance during plant development and in yeast will be covered here only briefly to provide a conceptual framework regarding cellular processes involved and to illustrate the degree of functional conservation between species .\nthis review will focus on recent developments regarding the role of cwi maintenance during biotic stress responses .\nit will discuss how cwi maintenance could have a previously unrecognized role in the perception of and response to biotic stress .\nwhile both plant and yeast cells are enveloped by cell walls , certain important differences exist that affect the biological role and function of the plant cwi maintenance mechanism .\nin addition , plant cell walls are structurally and chemically more complex than the yeast cell wall .\nthis means that in plant cells the sheer number of cell wall - related signaling events during development and plant environment interaction could disguise the activity of a dedicated plant cwi maintenance mechanism .\nthe yeast cwi monitoring and maintenance network is quite complex , providing an indication of the possible complexity of the plant cwi maintenance network . by combining inputs from a turgor pressure sensor ( sln1 ) , mechano - perception ( mid1/cch1 ) , and dedicated cell wall damage ( cwd ) sensors ( wsc1 , 2 , 3 , mid2 , mtl1 ) the yeast cwi maintenance network generates signals that permit highly specific responses to any challenge that impairs the functional integrity of the yeast cell wall .\nthe available phenotypic and genetic data also implicate turgor pressure , mechano - perception , and cwd detection in plant cwi maintenance ( hamann et al .\ninterestingly , arabidopsis histidine kinase1 ( ahk1 ) and cytokinin receptor1/arabidopsis histidine kinase4 ( cre1/ahk4 ) can at least partially rescue a yeast strain with a loss of function allele in sln1 ( urao et al .\nin addition , expression of the arabidopsis thaliana mid1 complementing activity 1 and 2 ( mca1,2 ) genes rescues a mid1-deficient yeast strain suggesting that they could function as stretch - activated calcium channels ( nakagawa et al .\nno functional homologues for the yeast cwd sensors have been identified in plants . in yeast ,\nthe signals generated by the sensors are relayed to the response genes via different signaling cascades involving calcineurin ( mid1/cch1 ) ; rho1/mpk1 ( wsc1 , mid2 ) , and ypd1 ( sln1 ) ( levin , 2005 ) .\ntranscription factors mediating the response are skn7 , rlm1 , and swi4/6 ( levin , 2005 ) .\nthe response can involve activation of genes required for cell wall biosynthetic processes , remodeling of the cytoskeleton , and cell cycle progression .\nthe available data suggest both organizational and functional similarities between the yeast and plant cwi maintenance mechanism while also highlighting how signals from mechanical and chemical sensors regulate jointly the cwd response .\nthe plant cell wall is comparable to an exoskeleton surrounding the plant cell and providing both structural support and protection from biotic as well as abiotic stresses .\nit consists of cellulose microfibrils , pectin , hemicelluloses , proteins , and in certain cases lignin ( somerville et al . , 2004 ) .\nplant cell walls are divided into primary ( laid down during cell elongation / differentiation ) and secondary ( formed after cell morphogenesis is concluded ) walls . in parallel ,\ndependent on the presence of certain polysaccharides type i and type ii cell walls are distinguished ( popper et al . , 2011 ) .\ncellulose microfibrils are the main load bearing elements , which are cross - linked to hemicelluloses and ( in vitro ) to pectin ( dick - perez et al . , 2011 ) .\nhemicelluloses and pectin also form direct links creating a matrix in which the microfibrils are embedded like the steel mesh in a concrete wall .\npectic polysaccharides like homogalacturonan ( hg ) are connected by calcium bridges between dimethyl - esterified parts of the molecules or through borate ester linkages in the case of rhamnogalacturonan ii ( rg ii ) .\nthey are targeted by pathogen - derived cell wall degrading enzymes ( polygalacturonases ) , which generate oligogalacturonides ( ogas ) from hg ( hahn et al . , 1981 ; kars et al . , 2005 ) .\nbiologically active ogas consist of chains of 915 galacturonic acid ( gala ) monomers and can function as signaling molecules ( see below ) .\nduring secondary cell wall formation monolignols ( precursors for lignin ) are secreted into the cell wall space and randomly cross - linked ( vanholme et al . , 2010 ) .\nthe cross - linking is dependent on the availability of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) generated by laccases and peroxidases .\nthis process reinforces the wall against pathogen infection , waterproofs it , and increases structural integrity ( tronchet et al . , 2010 ;\nreduction of cellulose biosynthesis during primary cell wall formation through genetic or chemical means leads to lignin production ( ellis et al . , 2002 ; hamann et al . ,\nthis highlights the ability of the cell to adapt to changes in cell wall composition and provides evidence for the existence of a cwi maintenance mechanism .\nplant cell walls are capable of adjusting their composition and structure in response to pathogen infection ( dong et al . , 2008 ) . a mutation in ( cellulose synthasea3 , cesa3 ) a subunit of the cellulose synthase complex leads to ectopic production of lignin , i.e. , replacement of a missing load bearing cell wall component by another one ( cano - delgado et al\nfollow up studies found that inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis during primary cell wall formation either through mutations like constitutive expression of vsp1 ( cev1 ) and ectopic lignification1 ( eli1 ) or inhibitors such as isoxaben results in transcriptional activation of stress response mechanisms ; ectopic production of ethylene ( et ) , salicylic acid ( sa ) , jasmonic acid ( ja ) , callose , and ros as well as changes in cell wall composition and structure ( ellis et al .\n, 2002 ; cano - delgado et al . , 2003 ; manfield et al . , 2004 ; hamann et al . ,\nthe experiments also showed that the response to cwd consists of early and late stages reminiscent of the response to pathogen infection ( denness et al . , 2011 ) .\nduring the early stage , ros- and calcium - based signaling cascades are required for initiating the response to cwd ( denness et al . , 2011 ) .\ninterestingly , 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ( acc , an et precursor ) and not et itself seems to be acting as signaling substance during the early response to isoxaben with inhibition of cell expansion being an active process and not simply an automatic consequence of cellulose biosynthesis inhibition ( tsang et al . , 2011 ) . during the late stage ,\nresponses to cwd - like lignin deposition are initiated and the extent of lignin formation is apparently modulated by a negative feedback loop formed by ros and ja ( denness et al . , 2011 ) .\na combination of genetic and phenotypic analysis has implicated the nadph oxidases respiratory burst oxidase homologd and f ( rbohd , f ) , the serine / threonine kinase oxidative signal inducible1 ( oxi1 ) , mca1 , the receptor - like kinase ( rlk ) theseus1 ( the1 ) as well as the ja biosynthesis genes allene oxide synthase ( aos ) and jasmonic acid resistant1 ( jar1 ) in the signaling mechanism mediating the response to cwd in arabidopsis seedlings .\ninterestingly , the cev1 mutation that affects cellulose biosynthesis during primary cell wall formation also causes enhanced resistance to infection by different powdery mildews ( erysiphe orontii , e. cichoracearum , and oidium lycopersicum ; ellis and turner , 2001 ) .\na screen for mutants causing resistance to powdery mildew infection provides further evidence of the close relationship between plant cell walls and pathogen resistance ( vogel and somerville , 2000 ) .\nthree of the powdery mildew resistance ( pmr ) mutants that have been identified on the molecular level affect genes involved in cell wall biosynthetic processes .\npmr4 encodes a callose synthase , pmr5 a gene of unknown function required for pectin production and pmr6 a pectate lyase ( vogel et al .\npmr4 resistance seems to be mediated via hyper - activation of sa signaling , whereas pmr5 and 6 resistance phenotypes are independent of ja , sa , and et signaling .\nmutations in irregularxylem1 ( irx1/cesa8 ) , 3 ( irx3/cesa7 ) , and 5 ( irx5/cesa4 ) impair cellulose biosynthesis during secondary cell wall formation and cause enhanced resistance to the soil borne bacterium ralstonia solanacearum and the necrotrophic fungus plectosphaerella cucumerina ( hernandez - blanco et al . , 2007 ) .\nmutations affecting cellulose biosynthesis during primary cell wall formation ( cesa1 , 3 , 6 ) or other components of the secondary cell wall ( pmr5 , pmr6 ) did not cause enhanced resistance to the same pathogens .\ngenetic analysis showed that the enhanced resistance in cesa4 , 7 , 8 is independent of ja , sa , and et - based signaling mechanisms .\nresults from expression profiling experiments and genetic analysis using different abscisic acid ( aba)mutants(aba insensitive 1 - 1;2 - 1;aba1 - 6 ) suggest that aba is mediating developmental and pathogen resistance phenotypes caused by the irx mutants .\nhowever , it remains to be determined if the aba involvement is direct or a secondary effect due to water stress caused by problems with xylem cell wall formation in the mutants .\nto summarize , these results suggest distinct resistance signaling cascades are induced by defects in primary and secondary cell wall formation as well as for different secondary cell wall components .\nthey also highlight the direct impact of changes in cell wall composition / structure on the response to pathogen infection .\nthe mode of action of the plant cell wall maintenance mechanism is not well understood .\nbased on the knowledge from yeast , chemical and physical signals could act as indicators for the functional integrity of the plant cell wall either individually or jointly . by combining these different types of signal\nthe plant cell would receive precise information regarding the state of its cell wall and the exact type of cwi impairment occurring .\nphysical signals could be generated by stretching of the plasma membrane due to a weakened cell wall that can not resist the high turgor pressure levels within a plant cell or a plasma membrane that is displaced relatively to the cell wall .\nthese events could be detected by stretch - activated or mechanosensitive channel proteins that lead to calcium influx into the cytoplasm , indicating cwd .\nsensor candidates could be encoded by members of the mechanosensitive channels of small conductance ( mscs)-like ( msl ) gene family like msl 9 and 10 affect mechano - perception in protoplasts derived from arabidopsis root cells ( haswell et al . , 2008 ) .\nanother candidate of interest is the putative stretch - activated calcium channel mca1 is required for cwd - induced lignin deposition .\ninterestingly , all isoxaben - induced cwd phenotypes can be suppressed by provision of osmotic support suggesting that changes in turgor pressure due to a weakened cell wall could result in signal generation via turgor pressure sensors ( hamann et al . , 2009 ; denness et al . ,\n2011 ) . while ahk1 and 4/cre1 can function as osmosensors in yeast and have been implicated in abiotic stress responses , no clear evidence exists implicating them in cwd perception in plants ( urao et al . , 1999\n; inoue et al . , 2001 ; tran et al . , 2007 ) .\nin addition , ahk4/cre1 has been shown to function as a cytokinin receptor(inoue et al . , 2001 ) .\ntherefore , the question that needs to be resolved at this point is if turgor pressure is a passive element in the process ( generating cell wall fragments due to a weakened cell wall ) or an active component that is being monitored and provides input into the process .\nthe plant cell wall contains a large number of components that could generate chemical signals ( ligands ) indicative of cwd or general danger signals .\nthe term damage associated molecular patterns ( damps ) has been coined to describe such ligands and the number of possible damps originating in plant cell walls is rather large ( zipfel , 2009 ) . here\ni will focus on the best - characterized group of signals , which are probably ogas .\nthey can be generated through degradation of hg by pathogen - derived enzymes ( kars et al .\nogas have been shown to induce gene expression changes , stomatal closure , production of et , and ros as well as cell wall reinforcement ( denoux et al .\n, 2008 ; ferrari et al . , 2008 ) . a hybrid kinase consisting of the extra cellular domain of wall - associated kinase1 ( wak1 ) and the intracellular domain of elongation factor tu receptor ( efr ) kinase can bind ogas and activate defense responses ( brutus et al . , 2010 )\n. wak1 belongs to a family of five wak genes encoding plasma membrane - localized ser / thr kinases that have been implicated in response to pathogen infection and regulation of cell elongation ( kohorn et al . , 2011 ) .\nthe effects of the chimeric wak1 kinase on pathogen resistance suggest that ogas and waks represent an in vivo ligand  receptor pair .\nresults from the analysis of a dominant active wak2 allele suggest the cwd signals perceived by waks could be relayed to downstream response genes through mapkinase6 ( mpk6 ) ( kohorn et al .\ninterestingly , wak2 has also been implicated in regulation of invertase activity and turgor pressure during cell elongation ( kohorn et al . ,\n2006 ) . however , there is currently no confirmation that waks are actively involved in cwi maintenance . in arabidopsis ,\nmore than 600 rlks have been identified and a large number of them have been implicated in developmental and stress response processes ( shiu and bleecker , 2001 ) .\ni will focus here on several kinases that have been implicated in cwd perception and/or pathogen response .\nmost of the rlks implicated in cwi maintenance [ the1 , hercules1 ( herk1 ) , feronia ( fer ) ] belong to the catharanthus roseus rlk1 ( crrlk1)-like protein family , which has 17 members in arabidopsis .\nthe1 was isolated as a suppressor of the cellulose - deficient cesa6 procuste ( pre ) mutant , which exhibits a hypocotyl elongation defect ( hematy et al . , 2007 ) .\nsubsequently it has been shown that the1 is required for cellulose biosynthesis inhibition - induced ros production and lignification in the root elongation zone ( denness et al . , 2011 ) .\nthe1 , herk1 , and fer have been implicated in brassinosteroid - induced cell elongation ( guo et al . , 2009 ; deslauriers and larsen , 2010 ) .\nboth fer and nortia / mildew resistance locus o 7 ( ml07 ; a seven - transmembrane domain protein involved in powdery mildew resistance ) are required for successful fertilization and resistance to infection by golovinomyces ( syn .\ninterestingly , ropgef ( guanine - exchange factors ) proteins have been identified as targets of fer activity ( duan et al . , 2010 ) .\nropgefs are required for the activation of rho gtpases , which in turn activate nadph oxidases like rbohd / f . these results suggest the same molecular components could mediate cell - cell interaction during development and plant \nheterotrimeric g - proteins ( g , g , g ) form a highly conserved signaling complex that has been implicated in signal transduction during development and stress responses in mammals , yeast , and plants ( digby et al . , 2006 ; temple and jones , 2007 ) . in arabidopsis , five genes gpa1 ( g ) , agb1 ( g ) , agg1 , 2 , 3 ( g1 , 2 , 3 ) encode the subunits of the complex ( thung et al . , 2011 ) .\nrecently , it has been reported that mutations in agg1 , 2 , and agb1 apparently cause enhanced susceptibility to infection with p. cucumerina ( delgado - cerezo et al . , 2011 ) .\na combination of metabolomic and microarray - based expression profiling studies of the mutants established that the pathogen phenotype is independent of sa , ja , aba , and et signaling cascades .\ninterestingly , a large number of cell wall biosynthetic / modifying genes are mis - regulated in agbl and aggl2 plants .\nanalysis of cell wall composition / structure in these plants found reduced xylose contents in the mutants compared to wildtype . to summarize ,\nthe available evidence supports the notion that the plant cell wall is an integral component contributing to pathogen response mechanisms and illustrates the influence of cell wall defects on infection .\nspecific signaling cascades seem to mediate the response to particular cell wall defects , which in turn affect the response to necrotrophic or biotrophic pathogens .\nmore importantly the data presented above allow correlation between certain types of cell wall defects , and not only signaling cascades but also resistance phenotypes .\nmutations in cesa4 , 7 , 8 , agg1 , 2 , and agb1 affect resistance to necrotrophs and are independent of phytohormone - based signaling cascades .\npmr5 , 6 plants exhibit resistance to biotrophs and also do not rely on phytohormone - based signaling cascades .\npmr4 affects resistance to biotrophs and resistance depends on the integrity of the sa signaling cascade .\nthe cell wall composition / structure changes could prevent pathogen colonization simply because the infection machinery of the pathogen is too specialized to breach the chemically modified cell wall .\nanother option is that the cell wall mutants cause defects similar to those occurring during infection by particular pathogens , i.e. , simulate infection by necrotrophs or biotrophs .\nthis would cause early / constant activation of the cwi maintenance / defense mechanism , which  primes  plant immunity thus making successful infection more difficult .\nthe latter would explain both the specificity of the responses observed and dependence on particular signaling mechanisms .\ntherefore , studies focusing on the effects of particular cell wall defects on pathogen resistance and the mode of action of the cwi maintenance mechanism could facilitate research into biotic stress response .\nthe reason being , that by removing the potentially multiple effects of the pathogen during infection , they reduce the complexity of the interaction and should therefore allow novel insights into the mechanisms responsible for detection of infection and/or physical damage .\nthe author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest ."}

however , the difference was negligible . in some genes like integrin 4 gene ,\nhowever , hypermethylation of these genes was frequent event in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas , lung cancers , and gastric cancers ( 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 ) .\nthus , dna methylation of these genes may be not related to tumorigenicity of aml / cml in contrast with other cancers . in summary , we have identified that aberrant dna methylation of shp1 is a frequent event in aml and cml . also , the frequencies of dna methylation of several methylation - controlled genes , including id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 , were higher in aml patients compared to those in cml patients .\nalthough these results should be confirmed , more comprehensive studies are necessary involving various known risk factors such as smoking and occupational carcinogens , and genetic susceptibilities .\nour results suggest that aberrant dna methylation of shp1 may be related to the tumorigenicity of aml and cml and hypermethylation of id4 , sfrp1 , and shp1 genes may contribute to the pathogenesis mechanism of aml specifically ."}

posterior florous copy image following successful reduction lateral radiograph of the right knee following surgery in knee splint\npatellar dislocations can vary widely in their pattern of presentation however vertical axis rotation complicates only a small number of these cases . in 1844 , cooper described the earliest case of patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation .\nsince then , only a handful of case reports describing vertical axis rotation of the patella have been published with the majority describing the location of the patella within the femoral trochlea ( intra - articular ) [ 2 - 11 ] . our case is rare as our patient had a less common variant of extra - articular patellar dislocation complicated by vertical axis rotation and by the fact , that the causative mechanism was largely atraumatic .\nprevious descriptions postulate that the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle acts as a pivot point , which can cause the patella to rotate around on its vertical axis . in this case , however , the patient denies any trauma , and instead describes externally rotating the leg whilst extended as the mechanism of injury .\nit is almost certain that the previous dislocations in our patient s case had resulted in significant damage of the mpfl . with the patient reporting his injury taking place with the knee  slightly  flexed , the function of the mpfl in this case as the primary medial restraint during the first 20 degrees of flexion was likely to be inadequate .\nprevious authors have described similar cases of extra - articular lateral patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation and have noted in their subsequent reviews of the limited literature that intra - aritcular dislocations were usually related to far more significant trauma than extra - articular dislocations [ 3 - 10 ] .\nthis was also the finding in a previous report highlighting the relative minor force resulting in an extra - articular dislocation .\nwe feel this may be an indication of the chronic deficiency in the mpfl likely contributing to cases of extra - articular dislocation . on reviewing the previous cases of extra - articular dislocation in the literature\n, none had described a completely atraumatic mechanism and none had discussed previous dislocations or previous surgical history in their patients .\ndetailed imaging can be difficult to obtain in the acute scenario ; however in these cases ct imaging may clarify patella position and demonstrate mechanical engagement of the patella on the lateral femoral condyle .\nin one case report , ct imaging was utilized and confirmed avulsions of the vastusmedialis muscle and medial crus of the patella tendon with resultant impaction of the medial border on the patella onto the lateral femoral condyle . in this case , imaging led to the decision for open reduction being required , minimizing further attempts at closed reduction which could in theory result in further damage .\nit is difficult to be absolutely sure why attempts at closed reduction had failed in our particular case , but this is likely to be multifactorial .\nvertical axis rotation results in impaction of the lateral edge of the patella on the lateral femoral epicondyle which may result in a corresponding femoral defect resulting in a lodging effect . furthermore patient factors , namely obesity and large muscle mass around the knee made manipulation technically difficult in our case .\nopen reduction under general anaesthetic is rarely necessary for routine patellar dislocations however there are some obvious advantages .\nthese include ; the possibility of direct visualisation of the obvious damage to the soft tissue structures contributing to or resultant from the dislocation . in our case it was likely\nthe mpfl had been damaged previously and repair is likely to help in restoring central patella tracking and overall stability . in this case , the patient was noted as having a shallow trochlea which might have accounted for his increased tendency to dislocations .\ndirect visual inspection may also help determine patients who are at risk of recurrent dislocations due to factors relating to their bony morphology and allow the surgeon to plan further management accordingly .\nlastly , visualisation of the articulating surfaces allows the surgeon to identify and address any osteochondral defects and corresponding loose bodies which may otherwise have contributed to long term future problems requiring eventual surgical intervention .\nfrom our experience with this case , difficulty in reducing a dislocated patella should alert surgeons to the possibility of an extra - articular dislocation with possible vertical axis rotation . in these scenarios , multiple attempts at reduction\nwe were able to achieve adequate analgesia and sedation using local and regional anaesthesia , without successful reduction of the dislocation .\nalthough some authors have demonstrated successful closed reduction with the use of local anaesthetic and muscle relaxants , this is not always effective . furthermore , attempted closed reduction under general anaesthesia in our case was also unsuccessful , demonstrating how closed reduction can be futile in certain cases .\nwe would recommend a low threshold for open reduction in such cases by a specialist knee surgeon who may assess and reconstruct damaged soft tissue damage in one operation vertical axis rotation is a rare entity complicating patella dislocations . in this rare event\nemergency physicians should be aware of this complication and refer to the relevant specialist for open reduction under general anaesthesia in order to minimize patient discomfort and potential articular surface damage ."}
